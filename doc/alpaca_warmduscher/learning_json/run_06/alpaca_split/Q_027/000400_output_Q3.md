The `zones` array within the `series` configuration for the `chartOptionsSoleDeltaTemp` chart allows you to conditionally format different parts of the area range based on the data values.  In this case, it defines two zones:

1.  **`value: 0` and `color: '#2596be'`**:  Any part of the area range where the data value is greater than or equal to 0 will be filled with the color `#2596be` (a blueish color).

2.  **`color: '#be3c25'`**: Any part of the area range where the data value is less than 0 will be filled with the color `#be3c25` (a reddish color).

This effectively creates a visual indication of whether the 'Sole Temperatur Unterschied' is positive or negative. Values above 0 (positive difference) are shown in blue, and values below 0 (negative difference) are shown in red.  This is a common technique for highlighting trends and quickly identifying areas of interest in a chart.
