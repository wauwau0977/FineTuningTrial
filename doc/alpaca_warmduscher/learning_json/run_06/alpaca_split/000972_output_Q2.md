Storing pre-calculated average, minimum, and maximum values offers immediate performance benefits when these statistics are needed, but it introduces trade-offs concerning storage, data integrity, and flexibility.

**Storage:**  Storing three additional `Double` values per data record increases storage requirements.  While seemingly small for individual records, this overhead can become significant when dealing with large datasets.

**Performance:**  Retrieving these pre-calculated values is much faster than calculating them on demand. This is particularly important for frequently accessed reports or real-time dashboards.

**Data Integrity/Accuracy:**  Pre-calculated values can become inconsistent if the underlying raw data changes and the statistics are not updated accordingly. This requires careful synchronization logic to ensure data integrity.  Also, the precision of the average, min and max are limited by the underlying data type, so there could be rounding errors.

**Flexibility:**  Storing only the raw data provides greater flexibility for performing different types of analysis.  We could calculate other statistics (e.g., standard deviation, percentiles) without needing to re-process the original data.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **If performance is critical and the data is relatively static:** Pre-calculating these values is a good approach, but robust synchronization is crucial.
*   **If data is frequently updated or analytical flexibility is important:** Storing raw data and calculating statistics on demand is preferred.
*   **A hybrid approach:** Store raw data alongside pre-calculated statistics. This provides the best of both worlds, but requires more complex data management.

The optimal approach depends on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data.
