Angular Material icons are a set of pre-designed, scalable vector graphics (SVGs) provided by the Angular Material library. They are used to enhance the visual appearance and user experience of an Angular application by providing consistent and recognizable icons.  The `mat-icon` directive is used to display these icons.

Benefits of using Angular Material icons compared to standard images:

*   **Scalability:** SVGs are vector-based, meaning they can be scaled to any size without losing quality or becoming pixelated. This makes them ideal for responsive design.
*   **Color Customization:** You can easily change the color of Material icons using CSS, making them consistent with your application's branding.
*   **Accessibility:** Material icons often have semantic meaning, which can improve accessibility for screen readers.  (Although it's important to provide appropriate ARIA attributes for complete accessibility.)
*   **Smaller File Size:** SVGs generally have smaller file sizes compared to raster image formats like PNG or JPG, resulting in faster loading times.
*   **Consistency:** Using a standardized icon library like Angular Material ensures a consistent visual style throughout your application.
*   **Easy Implementation:** The `mat-icon` directive simplifies the process of adding and managing icons in your Angular templates.
