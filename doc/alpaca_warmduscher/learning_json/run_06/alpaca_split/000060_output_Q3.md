This code snippet styles an Angular Material `mat-card` component.  Let's break down each property:

*   `border-color: white`:  Sets the color of the card's border to white. This provides a visual separation between the card and its surrounding content.
*   `border-width: 1px`:  Sets the width of the card's border to 1 pixel. Combined with `border-color`, this creates a thin white border around the card.
*   `margin: 12px 3px`:  Applies margin around the card. `12px` is applied to the top and bottom, creating vertical space around the card, while `3px` is applied to the left and right, creating horizontal space. This helps to visually separate the card from adjacent elements. The card will have 12px of margin on the top and bottom, and 3px of margin on the left and right.
