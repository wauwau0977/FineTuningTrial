The `doNotCache` flag provides a way to bypass the caching mechanism altogether for specific requests. It allows the `loader()` function to execute and return the data directly, without storing it in the `this.cache`.

Scenarios where you would use `doNotCache` include:

*   **Real-time Data:**  When dealing with data that changes very frequently and requires immediate updates, caching might introduce staleness. You would want to bypass the cache to ensure you always receive the most current information.
*   **User-Specific Data:** For data that is highly personalized and varies significantly between users, caching might not provide much benefit and could even lead to incorrect data being served if the cache is not properly invalidated.
*   **Initial Load vs. Subsequent Loads:** You might want to avoid caching the very first request for a piece of data to measure the initial load time and establish a baseline.
*   **Debugging/Testing:** During development, you might want to bypass the cache to ensure you are always working with the latest data from the source.

**Example Use Case:**

Imagine a chat application. New messages need to be displayed immediately. Caching the messages would introduce a delay, making the chat experience feel sluggish.  When a new message arrives, the component would call the `get` method with `doNotCache: true` to fetch the latest messages directly from the server, ensuring the user sees them in real-time.
