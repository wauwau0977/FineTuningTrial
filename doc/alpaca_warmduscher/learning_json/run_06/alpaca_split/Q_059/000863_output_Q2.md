The `ntile` function in the `findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats` method divides the rows retrieved from the `meteo_swiss` table into a specified number of groups (in this case, `maxRows`).  It assigns a bucket number (from 1 to `maxRows`) to each row based on the ordering specified in the `over (order by temperature_measure_date)` clause. Essentially, it's a way to partition the data before aggregation. The `group by grp, station_id` then aggregates the data within each of these `ntile` groups and station IDs.

The purpose here is likely to provide a rough limit on the amount of data processed and returned.  By grouping into `maxRows` buckets and then aggregating by group, the query attempts to return statistical information for a limited number of segments of the data.

Potential issues:

*   **Uneven Distribution:** If the `temperature_measure_date` values are not evenly distributed, the `ntile` groups might not have the same number of rows. This could lead to some groups having significantly more data points than others, skewing the aggregated statistics.
*   **Arbitrary Grouping:** The grouping is based solely on `temperature_measure_date` and isn't related to any specific business logic. This can lead to groups that are semantically meaningless.
*   **Performance:** While `ntile` can sometimes improve performance by reducing the number of rows processed, it introduces a sorting step (`order by temperature_measure_date`) which can be expensive, especially for large tables.
*   **No Guarantee of Limit:**  While the intent is to limit the result set, thereâ€™s no guarantee that the query will return exactly `maxRows` results. The final count depends on the number of distinct `station_id` values. If there are fewer distinct stations than `maxRows`, the query will return fewer than `maxRows` results.
