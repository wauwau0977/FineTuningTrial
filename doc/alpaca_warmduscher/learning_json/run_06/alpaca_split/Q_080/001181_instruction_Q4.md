For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `execute` method that accepts an `UnsafeRunnable` object. Explain how it handles null inputs and potential exceptions thrown by the runnable. Provide a complete code implementation of the method. Assume `UnsafeRunnable` is a functional interface that defines a `run()` method which can throw exceptions.
