You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface defines a data structure for representing aggregated boiler statistics collected hourly. It provides access to the hour of the day, cumulative decreases and increases in boiler differences, and the total number of statistic records used to calculate these values. It serves as a contract for data objects representing hourly boiler performance metrics.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerStatsByHour`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Define the structure for accessing hourly boiler statistics.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This interface itself does not handle direct input or output. It *defines* the output structure expected from data aggregation processes.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The interface supports retrieving pre-calculated aggregate data. No internal workflow is defined within the interface itself. The data is likely computed elsewhere and represented through this interface.
- **External Interactions**:  This interface likely interacts with data storage or calculation services to populate the data it represents.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Not directly handled within the interface.  Implementations that *use* this interface should handle null or invalid data appropriately.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Access to the data via getter methods should be fast (constant time).
- **Maintainability**:  The interface is simple and well-defined, promoting easy maintenance and modification.  Adding new statistics fields would require modification of the interface.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The reliability of the data depends on the processes that *populate* the data. The interface itself has no inherent reliability constraints.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `getHourOfTheDay()`: Returns the hour of the day (integer).
    - `getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()`: Returns the cumulative sum of boiler difference decreases (double).
    - `getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`: Returns the cumulative sum of boiler difference increases (double).
    - `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`: Returns the number of statistic records contributing to the calculations (long).
- **Important logic flows:** None – this is an interface definition only.
- **Error handling:** None – this is an interface definition only.
- **Classes:** This is an interface; there are no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: Part of the `analytics` package, suggesting involvement in data analysis and reporting.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Primitive data types (Integer, Double, Long)
- Interfaces

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Jackson Annotations:** `JsonPropertyOrder` is used for serialization control (presumably in JSON responses).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly defined within the interface itself.  However, it likely relies on internal data access or calculation services within the `Warmduscher` project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Data Validation**: Consider adding validation logic in implementing classes to ensure the data is within expected ranges (e.g., hour of day is between 0 and 23).
- **Immutability**:  Consider making implementing classes immutable to prevent accidental data modification.
- **More Descriptive Field Names**: While understandable, names like `numOfStatisticRecords1` could benefit from clearer names like `recordCount` or `statisticRecordCount`.
- **Expand Statistics**: Consider adding more derived statistics (e.g., average temperature difference, standard deviation) if they are relevant for analysis. These would require interface changes.
