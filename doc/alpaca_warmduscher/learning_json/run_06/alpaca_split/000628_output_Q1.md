Using a hardcoded value for `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` presents several issues:

*   **Lack of Configurability:**  Changing the refresh interval requires a code change and redeployment.  This isn't ideal if the interval needs to be adjusted frequently or based on external factors.
*   **Rigidity:**  The interval is the same for all users and environments, which might not be optimal.
*   **Testing Challenges:**  Testing different refresh intervals requires code modifications.

To improve the design:

1.  **Move to Environment Variable/Configuration:** Make `fullPageRefreshInSeconcs` configurable via an environment variable or through a configuration file.  This allows administrators to adjust the interval without code changes.
2.  **Consider User-Specific Settings:** If appropriate, store the refresh interval in user preferences (e.g., in a database or local storage).  This would allow each user to customize their experience.
3.  **Implement a Strategy Pattern:**  Abstract the refresh logic behind an interface. Implement different refresh strategies (e.g., fixed interval, adaptive interval based on user activity) and select the appropriate strategy at runtime.
4.  **Use a Service:** Encapsulate the refresh interval and logic into a service. This promotes reusability and testability.
