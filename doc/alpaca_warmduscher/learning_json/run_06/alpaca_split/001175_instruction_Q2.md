For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java'... 
The code consistently re-throws exceptions as `RuntimeException`. Consider the `UnsafeRunnable` interface and its corresponding `execute` method:
```java
static void execute(UnsafeRunnable c) {
    if (c == null) {
        return;
    }
    try {
        c.run();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```
What are the implications of this approach if `UnsafeRunnable` is used for long-running tasks within a multi-threaded application? How could the exception handling be improved to better suit this scenario?
