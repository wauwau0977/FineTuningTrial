The `@Entity` annotation signifies that this class represents a database table or a persistent object. It tells the JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation (like Hibernate) to map this class to a database table. This enables functionalities like object-relational mapping (ORM), allowing the application to interact with the database using Java objects.

The `@Immutable` annotation indicates that instances of this class are intended to be unchangeable after creation. This annotation provides a hint to the JPA provider to optimize for read-only access. This means the provider can cache instances more effectively and potentially skip certain consistency checks. Importantly, this annotation *doesnâ€™t* guarantee immutability; it's a suggestion to the JPA provider. True immutability would require making all fields `final` and ensuring no internal mutable state exists. However, `@Immutable` combined with JPA can significantly improve performance for read-heavy scenarios.
