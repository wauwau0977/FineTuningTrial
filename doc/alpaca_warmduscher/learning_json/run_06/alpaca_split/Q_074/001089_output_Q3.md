The `& 0xFF` operation is a bitwise AND operation that converts the byte value `number[i]` to an unsigned integer in the range of 0 to 255. 

Here's why it's necessary:

1. **Byte Representation:** In Java, `byte` is a signed type, meaning it can represent both positive and negative values (-128 to 127).  However, in the `divmod` method, we're treating each byte as a digit in a base-`base` number system, which inherently implies non-negative values.

2. **Preventing Sign Extension:**  When a signed byte is cast to an `int`, Java performs *sign extension*. This means the most significant bits of the `int` are filled with the sign bit of the byte.  For example, if `number[i]` is -1 (represented as 11111111 in binary), casting it to an `int` without masking would result in an integer with the upper bits set to 1, giving a negative value.

3. **Correct Calculation:** The `divmod` method performs division and modulo operations on the digits.  If sign extension occurs, it would lead to incorrect results. Masking with `& 0xFF` ensures that only the lower 8 bits are considered, effectively treating the byte as an unsigned integer and preventing sign extension.  This yields the correct digit value for the base conversion logic.

In summary, `& 0xFF` is crucial for ensuring that the byte is treated as an unsigned positive value, preventing sign extension and guaranteeing accurate calculations in the `divmod` method.
