The logic would need to account for the full range of a 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295) and map it appropriately to a signed representation.  The current logic only handles values that "wrap around" within a 16-bit range. To handle 32-bit values, we would likely need to check if the input value is greater than the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer (2147483647). If it is, we'd need to subtract 4294967296 (2^32) from it to get the correct signed equivalent using twoâ€™s complement representation.

Simply casting a 32-bit unsigned integer to a 32-bit signed integer could lead to unexpected results. The unsigned value greater than 2147483647 will wrap around and be interpreted as a negative value, but not the correct one. For example, 4294967295 would be cast to -1, which is technically correct but doesn't reflect the original unsigned value. The important thing is that we need to explicitly handle the conversion to ensure accuracy and prevent unintended behavior. Using bitwise operations or modular arithmetic might be necessary.
