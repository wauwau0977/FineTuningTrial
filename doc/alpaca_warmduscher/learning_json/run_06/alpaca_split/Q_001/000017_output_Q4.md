The `<noscript>` tag provides fallback content to be displayed to users who have JavaScript disabled in their browser or if JavaScript execution fails.

The content within the `<noscript>` tag in this file is: `Please enable JavaScript to continue using this application.`.

**Scenarios where this content would be displayed:**

1.  **JavaScript Disabled:** If the user has explicitly disabled JavaScript in their browser settings, the `<noscript>` content will be displayed instead of the application's JavaScript-driven functionality.

2.  **JavaScript Errors:** If the JavaScript code encounters a critical error that prevents it from executing properly (e.g., a syntax error or runtime exception), the browser might fall back to displaying the `<noscript>` content.

3. **Browser Compatibility Issues:** In rare cases, if the browser does not support the version of JavaScript used in the application, the `<noscript>` content may be shown.

**Why it is included:**

The Warmduscher application is heavily reliant on JavaScript to render the user interface, handle user interactions, and fetch/display data. Without JavaScript, the application would not function correctly. The `<noscript>` tag serves as a graceful fallback, informing the user that JavaScript is required and instructing them to enable it. This improves the user experience by providing a clear explanation of the problem and offering a solution, rather than simply displaying a broken or empty page. It is considered a best practice for web applications that heavily rely on JavaScript.
