The `ofWebService()` method gracefully handles potentially null data by returning `this.emptyInstance()` if `data` is null. This prevents errors that could occur if you tried to access properties of a null object. However, the approach doesn't explicitly handle *invalid* data types within the `data` object. If, for example, `data.soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg` is a string instead of a number, it could lead to runtime errors later on when that value is used in calculations or comparisons. A more robust approach would involve adding validation checks within `ofWebService()` to ensure data types are correct and potentially throwing an error or logging a warning if invalid data is encountered. This would improve the resilience and reliability of the application.
