The method `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` includes a complex nested query. Within this query, the subquery calculates `num_of_statistic_records_1` using `count(1) over ()`. What is the purpose of using a window function with `count(1) over ()` in this specific context, and how does it differ from a simple `count(*)` aggregate function?
