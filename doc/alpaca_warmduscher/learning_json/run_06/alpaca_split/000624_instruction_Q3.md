For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts' with name 'environment.prod.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...
```typescript
"buildTimestampClient": "v01-20220220-093352"
```
What is the likely purpose of the `buildTimestampClient` property, and how might the application utilize this value at runtime? Why is it a string, and what does the format of the string indicate?
