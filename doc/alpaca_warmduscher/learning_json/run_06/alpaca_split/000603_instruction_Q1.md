For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.ts'... 
The component subscribes to multiple observables (`getMeteoSwissCurrent`, `getMeteoSwissHistorical`, `getCurrent`).  What potential problems could arise from managing multiple subscriptions without proper unsubscription, and how are those handled (or not handled) in this code?
