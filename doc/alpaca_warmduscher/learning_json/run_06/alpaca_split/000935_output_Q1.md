Using `Double` introduces potential precision issues due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in computers.  Repeated addition of `Double` values can lead to accumulated rounding errors, which could become significant over time, especially if the sums involve many small values or a large number of records. Alternatives to consider include:

1.  **`BigDecimal`**:  `BigDecimal` provides arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic, eliminating rounding errors. It's suitable when precise calculations are critical, such as financial data.  However, it's computationally more expensive than using `Double`.
2.  **`long` or `BigInteger`**: If the sums always represent whole numbers, using `long` or `BigInteger` would provide exact representation without rounding errors.  This depends on the nature of `BoilerDiffDecrease` and `BoilerDiffIncrease`.
3.  **Scaling**: Multiplying the `Double` values by a suitable power of 10 and storing them as `long` (e.g., storing amounts in cents instead of dollars) can also provide a solution, but requires careful handling of the scaling factor.

The best choice depends on the required level of precision, the range of values, and performance considerations.
