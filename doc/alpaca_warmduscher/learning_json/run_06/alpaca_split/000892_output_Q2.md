The most suitable data type for these pump status methods depends on *what* aspect of the pump status is being represented. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of options and their trade-offs:

*   **`Boolean`:** If these methods simply indicate whether a pump is on or off (true/false), `Boolean` is the most straightforward and efficient choice. It's space-efficient and clearly communicates the pump's operational state.
*   **`Integer`:** If the values represent pump speed (e.g., 0-100%), pump power level (e.g., percentage of maximum power), or a discrete state (e.g., 0=off, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high), `Integer` is appropriate. It allows for more granularity than `Boolean`.
*   **`Double`:** If the values represent a continuous variable like pump load (e.g., percentage of maximum load), flow rate, or power consumption (in watts), `Double` is the most suitable choice. It provides the highest precision.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Precision vs. Storage:** `Double` offers the highest precision but requires more storage space than `Integer` or `Boolean`.
*   **Semantic Clarity:** Choosing the right data type improves the semantic clarity of the code. For example, using `Boolean` for on/off status makes the code more readable and self-documenting.
*   **Calculation & Analysis:**  If these values will be used in calculations (e.g., calculating total power consumption), using an appropriate numeric type (e.g., `Double`) is crucial.

**In this specific case**, without more context, `Integer` is a reasonable compromise if the pump status represents a few discrete levels or percentages. If the pump status is purely on/off, `Boolean` is best. If it's a precise measurement like flow rate, `Double` is the only appropriate choice. It's important to choose the data type that best reflects the *meaning* of the value being represented.
