For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java'... 
Considering the `StartupData` class as it currently exists, what are potential drawbacks of using this class in a multi-threaded environment? Specifically, if multiple threads attempt to modify `startupTimeTakenInMillis` concurrently, what could happen? How would you address this issue?
