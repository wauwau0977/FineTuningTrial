I would leverage Spring's logging infrastructure (typically Logback or Log4j2, configured via `application.properties` or `application.yml`) to log the startup time.  I'd inject a `Logger` instance into the `StartupData` class and use it within the setter method.  No additional components beyond standard Spring logging configuration are *strictly* necessary, though a dedicated logging aspect could be considered for more complex scenarios.

```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.spring;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Component
public class StartupData {
   private long startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(StartupData.class);

   public long getStartupTimeTakenInMillis() {
       return startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   }

   public void setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis) {
       this.startupTimeTakenInMillis = startupTimeTakenInMillis;
       logger.info("Application startup time: {} ms", startupTimeTakenInMillis);
   }
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Logger Injection:** I added a static `Logger` instance, obtained using `LoggerFactory.getLogger(StartupData.class)`. This ensures that all logs originating from this class are properly associated with it. Static logger instance is fine since this is a singleton `@Component`.
*   **Logging within Setter:** The `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis` method now includes a `logger.info()` call.  This logs the startup time with an informative message.  Using `info` level is appropriate for startup metrics.  You could adjust the level to `debug` or `warn` based on the severity or context.
*   **Configuration:**  The logging level and output format are controlled via Spring's logging configuration (e.g., `logback.xml` or `application.properties`).  You would ensure that the logging level for the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.spring` package is set to `INFO` or lower to see these messages.
