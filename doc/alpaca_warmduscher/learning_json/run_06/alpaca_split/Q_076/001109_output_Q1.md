While the current validation is a good start, several improvements could be made:

1.  **Email Address Format Validation:** Implement regular expression (regex) validation to ensure that `mailSender` and each email address in `receiverMails` conform to a valid email address format (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`). This prevents invalid addresses from being processed.
2.  **Receiver List Validation:**  Instead of directly parsing `receiverMails` with `InternetAddress.parse()`, consider splitting the string into individual email addresses and validating each one separately *before* parsing. This allows for more granular error handling.
3.  **Maximum Recipient Limit:** Add a check to limit the number of recipients in `receiverMails` to prevent potential denial-of-service attacks or exceeding email provider limits.
4.  **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `subject` and `content` parameters to prevent potential email injection attacks. This involves escaping or removing potentially harmful characters (e.g., newline characters) that could be used to manipulate the email headers or body.
5. **Character Encoding:** Ensure consistent character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) for the `subject` and `content` to avoid display issues or potential vulnerabilities.
6. **Length Validation:** Limit the length of `subject` and `content` to prevent excessively long emails from causing problems.

By adding these checks, the `send` method becomes more resilient to invalid input, potential security threats, and unexpected errors.
