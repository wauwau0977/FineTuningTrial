For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java' with name 'GlobalSynced.java'... 
Consider the `requestOperation` method. What potential issues could arise from the placement of the `hooks.after()` call within the `catch` block, and how could you improve the design to address them? Explain your reasoning, considering scenarios where `m.operateGlobalSynced()` might throw an exception.
