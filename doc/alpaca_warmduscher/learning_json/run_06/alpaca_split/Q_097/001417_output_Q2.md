Dependency injection (DI) offers several advantages here. Firstly, it promotes loose coupling. The `InfoService` isn’t responsible for *creating* the `InfoBean`; it merely *uses* it. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. Secondly, it improves testability. We can easily mock or stub the `InfoBean` during unit testing, allowing us to isolate the logic within `getInfo()` and verify its behavior without relying on the actual implementation of `InfoBean`.  Finally, it promotes reusability. A different implementation of `InfoBean` could be easily injected without modifying `InfoService`.

A disadvantage might be increased complexity initially, though frameworks like Spring largely mitigate that. There’s a small runtime overhead due to DI, but it’s generally negligible.

To test this method effectively, I’d use a mocking framework (like Mockito). I’d:

1.  **Mock the `InfoBean`:**  Create a mock `InfoBean` and define its behavior (e.g., return a specific object when `getInfo()` is called).
2.  **Inject the Mock:** Spring will handle injecting the mock during testing.
3.  **Call `getInfo()`:**  Invoke the `getInfo()` method on the `InfoService` instance.
4.  **Verify Interaction:** Assert that the `getInfo()` method returned the mock `InfoBean` that was configured.  We aren’t testing the *contents* of the `InfoBean` here, just that the correct instance is returned.
