For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.spec.ts' with name 'app.component.spec.ts'...  If the application's title was dynamically set within the `AppComponent`'s component logic, how would you modify the second test case ('should have as title 'thserver-client'') to verify the dynamically set title?
