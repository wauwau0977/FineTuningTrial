Relying solely on the `visibilitychange` event for data refresh has several potential downsides:

1.  **Data Staleness in the Background:** If the user leaves the tab visible for a long period without interacting with the application, the data might become significantly stale. The application won’t proactively refresh it.
2.  **Network Conditions:** The user might be on a slow or unreliable network. Refreshing data immediately when the tab becomes visible could lead to a poor user experience if the request takes a long time.
3.  **Unnecessary Refresh:** The user might quickly switch between tabs or applications. Refreshing data on every visibility change could be wasteful if the data hasn’t changed significantly.

To improve the handling of data staleness, consider a combination of approaches:

1.  **Timed Refresh:** Implement a background timer (similar to the existing `subscribe` interval, but potentially longer) to periodically refresh the data, regardless of browser visibility.
2.  **Last Updated Timestamp:** Store the timestamp of the last successful data fetch. Compare this timestamp with the current time to determine if the data is stale. Refresh the data only if it’s older than a certain threshold.
3.  **Optimistic Updates & Caching:** Cache the fetched data and display it immediately. When the user becomes active or the data is determined to be stale, initiate a background refresh and update the UI accordingly.
4.  **Combining Visibility Change with Timed Refresh:** Use the `visibilitychange` event as a signal to *accelerate* the next scheduled refresh, rather than initiating a refresh immediately. This can provide a better balance between responsiveness and resource usage.

By combining these strategies, you can ensure that the data is reasonably up-to-date without overwhelming the network or the user's device. The ideal approach will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the expected frequency of data changes.
