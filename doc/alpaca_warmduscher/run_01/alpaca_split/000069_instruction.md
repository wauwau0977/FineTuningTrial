You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This file, `environment.ts`, defines environment-specific configuration variables for the 'Warmduscher' project's TypeScript client application. It primarily configures the base URL for the backend service, a refresh interval for data, and a build timestamp for tracking client versions. The file is designed to be replaced during the build process (e.g., using `environment.prod.ts` for production builds), allowing for different configurations based on the deployment environment.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** None (This file is a TypeScript configuration file exporting a constant object; it does not define any classes.)

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Provides configuration variables for the client application, allowing it to connect to the correct backend service and adjust behavior based on the environment.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: There are no direct user inputs. The file serves as a configuration source for the application. The outputs are the values of the configuration variables used by the client application.
- **Workflow/Logic**:  The file defines a constant `environment` object that holds key-value pairs for configuration parameters. The application reads these values at runtime. The intended workflow is to replace this file with environment-specific configurations during the build process.
- **External Interactions**: The application reads the `serviceBaseURL` to make HTTP requests to the backend server. It relies on the build system to replace the file with the correct configurations.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Incorrect `serviceBaseURL`**: If the `serviceBaseURL` is incorrect, the client application will not be able to communicate with the backend server, resulting in errors.
    - **Missing File**: If the file is missing during build, the application will likely fail to start or exhibit unexpected behavior.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal impact on application performance. The file is read only during application startup.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable. This is a configuration file and does not directly contribute to scalability.
- **Security**: The `serviceBaseURL` should be secured (HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
- **Maintainability**: The file is simple and easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The file should be reliably available as part of the build process.
- **Usability**: Easy to use and integrate. The configuration variables are clearly named and documented.
- **Compliance**:  Ensure the `serviceBaseURL` adheres to any relevant security or compliance requirements (e.g., data privacy regulations).

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**: No functions defined in this file.
- **Important logic flows**: Simple variable assignment and export.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling. Errors related to incorrect configuration will manifest at runtime.
- **Classes**: None.
- **Modules**: The file functions as a module, exporting a configuration object.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **TypeScript**:  Used for defining the configuration object.
- **Object Literals**:  Used to create the `environment` object.
- **Export Statements**: Used to make the `environment` object available to other modules.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular (implicitly)**: This file is designed for use within an Angular application.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: None applicable.
- **Code Readability**: The file is already very readable.
- **Security Improvements**:  Ensure the production build uses HTTPS for the `serviceBaseURL`. Consider using environment variables during the build process to manage the `serviceBaseURL` securely.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable for this file. Consider using a more dynamic configuration mechanism (e.g., a configuration server) for increased scalability and flexibility in larger deployments. Consider a config file that is dynamically loaded during runtime.
