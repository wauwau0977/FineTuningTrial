The current approach of using individual boolean fields for each discrete input has several drawbacks, especially considering the potentially large number of such inputs.

*   **Maintainability:**  Adding or removing discrete inputs requires modifying the class definition, adding/removing fields, and potentially modifying any code that accesses these fields. This becomes cumbersome and error-prone as the number of inputs grows.
*   **Readability:** A long list of boolean fields makes the class harder to read and understand. It obscures the overall structure and makes it difficult to quickly grasp the purpose of each field.
*   **Scalability:**  The class could become bloated and unwieldy, impacting performance and memory usage.
*   **Code Duplication:** Accessing and setting these boolean values might lead to repetitive code throughout the application.

A better approach would be to use a more flexible data structure, such as a `BitSet` or a `Map`.  Here are two potential refactoring options:

**1. Using a BitSet:**

If the discrete inputs represent a fixed set of flags, a `BitSet` would be a very efficient choice. Each bit in the `BitSet` can represent a single discrete input.

```java
private BitSet discreteInputs = new BitSet();

// Constants for each discrete input
private static final int DI1_ERROR_INDEX = 0;
private static final int DI10_COMPRESSOR1_INDEX = 1;
// ... and so on

public boolean isDi1Error() {
    return discreteInputs.get(DI1_ERROR_INDEX);
}

public void setDi1Error(boolean value) {
    discreteInputs.set(DI1_ERROR_INDEX, value);
}
```

This approach significantly reduces the number of fields in the class and provides a more compact representation of the discrete inputs.

**2. Using a Map:**

If the discrete inputs are dynamic or have associated metadata, a `Map` would be more suitable.

```java
private Map<String, Boolean> discreteInputs = new HashMap<>();

public boolean isDi1Error() {
    return discreteInputs.getOrDefault("di1Error", false);
}

public void setDi1Error(boolean value) {
    discreteInputs.put("di1Error", value);
}
```

This approach allows for adding or removing discrete inputs at runtime and provides a more flexible way to manage them.  The keys in the map could be constants to avoid typos and improve readability.  The value could also be an enum to further constrain the possible values.

The choice between `BitSet` and `Map` depends on the specific requirements of the application. If the discrete inputs are fixed and performance is critical, `BitSet` is a better choice. If the discrete inputs are dynamic or require additional metadata, `Map` is more appropriate.  Either approach would improve the maintainability, readability, and scalability of the `HeatPumpEntity` class.
