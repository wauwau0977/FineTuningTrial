The `@Table` annotation defines three indexes: `METEO_SWISS_IX_1` on `createDate`, `METEO_SWISS_IX_2` on `sunshineMeasureDate`, and `METEO_SWISS_IX_3` on `temperatureMeasureDate`. These indexes are created to improve the performance of database queries that filter or sort data based on these columns. 

Specifically:

*   `createDate`: Indexing `createDate` is likely for queries that need to retrieve records based on when they were created, perhaps for reporting or auditing purposes.  It enables faster retrieval of data within a specific date range or ordered by creation time.
*   `sunshineMeasureDate`: Indexing `sunshineMeasureDate` suggests frequent queries that need to find measurements taken on specific dates or within date ranges concerning sunshine. This is crucial for time-series analysis of sunshine data.
*   `temperatureMeasureDate`: Similar to `sunshineMeasureDate`, this index supports efficient querying for temperature measurements taken on or within specific dates, facilitating time-series analysis and historical temperature data retrieval.

By creating indexes on these columns, the database can avoid full table scans, significantly speeding up query execution for common use cases involving these columns. The cost is slightly increased write performance (inserts, updates, deletes) as the index needs to be maintained.
