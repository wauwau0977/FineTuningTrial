The `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method is a getter method that allows external access to the private field `startupTimeTakenInMillis`. It returns the value of `startupTimeTakenInMillis`, which represents the time taken for application startup, measured in milliseconds.

This method directly relates to encapsulation principles. The `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field is declared as `private`, meaning it's only accessible within the `StartupData` class itself. Providing a public getter method like `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` allows controlled access to this data from other parts of the application without directly exposing the field itself. This protects the internal state of the `StartupData` object and allows for potential validation or modification of the value before itâ€™s returned, ensuring data integrity.
