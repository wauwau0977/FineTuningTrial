For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts' with name 'about.component.ts'... 
The `getBuildTimestampServer()` method returns the `buildTimestampServer` property. This return value doesn't seem immediately useful, given the asynchronous nature of the call. What are the potential reasons for returning this value, and what refactorings could you suggest to improve the design and usability of this method?
