These `@font-face` rules are used to define custom fonts that will be used on the webpage.  In this case, the code defines multiple variations of the 'Roboto' font, specifying its style (normal), weight (300), and display property (swap). The code effectively imports the Roboto font for use on the website.

The `unicode-range` property within each `@font-face` rule is crucial for performance optimization. It specifies the Unicode character ranges for which the font should be used.  Instead of downloading the entire font file for all characters, the browser will only download the specific glyphs (character representations) needed for the specified Unicode ranges.

For example, `unicode-range:U+0460-052F, U+1C80-1C88, U+20B4, U+2DE0-2DFF, U+A640-A69F, U+FE2E-FE2F;` tells the browser to use this particular font file only for characters within those specific Unicode ranges, which represent characters from various languages (e.g., Cyrillic, Armenian, etc.). By dividing the font into subsets based on Unicode ranges, the browser can reduce the initial download size and improve page load times, especially for users who only need a limited set of characters.
