Adding a profile with significantly different dependencies requires careful planning to maintain modularity and avoid tight coupling. Here’s the approach I’d take, leveraging key design principles:

1.  **Interface Abstraction:**  First, define clear interfaces for the components that will be affected by the new dependencies. This isolates the core application logic from the specifics of any particular implementation.

2.  **Dependency Injection:**  Utilize a dependency injection (DI) container (like Spring or Guice).  The DI container will manage the creation and injection of the appropriate dependencies based on the active profile.

3.  **Profile-Specific Modules/Configurations:** Create a dedicated module or configuration file for the new profile. This module would define the bindings between interfaces and the new implementations required by the profile.  The DI container would load this module when the profile is activated.

4.  **Conditional Bean Definitions/Configuration:**  Within the DI container configuration, use conditional bean definitions or configuration based on the active profile. This ensures that the correct implementations are loaded only when the corresponding profile is active. For example, in Spring, you could use `@Profile` annotations or conditional `@Bean` creation.

5.  **Plugin Architecture (Optional):** For extremely flexible systems, consider a plugin architecture. The new dependencies could be packaged as a separate plugin, which is dynamically loaded and registered with the application when the profile is activated. This promotes maximum modularity and extensibility.

6.  **Versioning and Compatibility:** As you introduce new profiles, carefully manage versioning and compatibility. Ensure that existing profiles continue to function correctly and that any changes to interfaces or dependencies are backward-compatible or handled gracefully.

**Example (Spring):**

```java
@Configuration
@Profile("newSensorProfile")
public class NewSensorConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public Sensor newSensor() {
        return new NewSensorImplementation();
    }

    @Bean
    public DataProcessor dataProcessor(Sensor sensor) {
        return new DataProcessor(sensor); // Dependency injected
    }
}
```

This approach prioritizes loose coupling, modularity, and extensibility, making it easier to add new features and functionalities without disrupting existing code.
