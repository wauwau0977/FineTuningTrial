For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts'... 
Considering the `get` method: `if (evict) { this.cache[cacheKey] = null; }`, what is the purpose of setting the cached value to `null` when `evict` is true, and how does this interact with the subsequent `if (this.cache[cacheKey] == null)` condition? Explain the implications for cache invalidation and potential re-fetching of data.
