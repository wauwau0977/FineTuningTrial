For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts' with name 'about.component.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
 getBuildTimestampServer() {
   // @ts-ignore
   this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo().subscribe(info => this.buildTimestampServer = info.buildTimestampServer);
   return this.buildTimestampServer;
 }
```

What is the purpose of the `subscribe` method and the `@ts-ignore` comment? Describe the potential issue the `@ts-ignore` comment is masking, and why it might be present.
