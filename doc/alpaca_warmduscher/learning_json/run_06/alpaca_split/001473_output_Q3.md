These two `<link>` tags are used to define the application's icons for different platforms. Specifically:

*   `rel="apple-touch-icon"`: This tag defines the icon that will be used when the application is added to the home screen on iOS devices (iPhones and iPads).
*   `rel="icon"`: This tag defines the favicon, which is the icon displayed in the browser tab or bookmarks.

The comment `<!-- for Apple iOS, must be non-transparent -->` highlights a specific requirement for the Apple iOS platform.  Apple's iOS web app support historically (and still in some cases) required the `apple-touch-icon` to be a non-transparent PNG image. If a transparent background is used, iOS might not display the icon correctly when the web app is added to the home screen, or it might render it with an unwanted background color.  Using a solid, non-transparent background ensures consistent and correct rendering on iOS devices.
