For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.ts' with name 'client-id.service.ts'... The code concatenates values from a `Uint32Array` into a string.  What potential issues might arise from this approach, and how could it be improved?
