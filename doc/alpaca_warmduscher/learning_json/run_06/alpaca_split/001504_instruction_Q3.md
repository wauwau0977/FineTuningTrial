For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(32767), 32767);
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(32768), -32768);
```
What do these assertions specifically test? Explain the significance of testing these two values in close proximity to each other. What does it indicate about how the `getSignedNumber` method likely handles the boundary between positive and negative signed 16-bit integer representations?
