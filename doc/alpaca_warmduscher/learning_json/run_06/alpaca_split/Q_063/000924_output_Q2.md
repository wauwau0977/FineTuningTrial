The potential drawbacks of having only setter methods without validation are:

*   **Invalid Data:** The class can be put into an invalid state if a setter is called with an inappropriate value. For example, `processingTime` could be set to a negative value or `clientId` could be set to an empty string.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** The database might enforce some constraints, but relying solely on the database for validation can lead to inconsistencies between the application logic and the database schema.
*   **Difficult Debugging:** If invalid data enters the system, it can be difficult to trace the source of the error.
*   **Reduced Encapsulation:** The class loses some of its encapsulation because it doesn't control how its internal state is modified.

To address these concerns, I would implement validation within the setter methods:

1.  **Input Validation:**  Check the validity of the input parameters before assigning them to the fields.  This might involve checking for null values, empty strings, invalid ranges, or other constraints.
2.  **Exception Handling:**  If an invalid value is detected, throw an appropriate exception (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`) to signal the error.
3.  **Defensive Copying:** For mutable objects assigned to fields, create defensive copies to prevent external modifications from affecting the internal state of the `SessionRequest` object.

For example, the `setProcessingTime` method could be modified as follows:

```java
public void setProcessingTime(Long processingTime) {
    if (processingTime == null || processingTime < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Processing time must be a non-negative value.");
    }
    this.processingTime = processingTime;
}
```

Alternatively, consider using a constructor to enforce the initial state, and make the fields `private` and `final` to prevent external modifications after construction. This promotes immutability and simplifies validation.
