The `group_every_nth_second` parameter in the `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method determines the interval, in seconds, over which the data will be aggregated. The query groups the heat pump data by dividing the time range between `measurement_date_start` and `measurement_date_end` into segments of this specified duration.  Essentially, it performs a time-series aggregation, calculating statistics (like average, min, max) for each time interval. The query uses `round(extract(epoch from measurement_date) / :group_every_nth_second)` to achieve this grouping.

Potential issues and considerations:

*   **Granularity vs. Data Volume:** A smaller value (e.g., 1 second) will result in very fine-grained statistics and a large number of groups. This could lead to performance issues or excessive data. A larger value (e.g., 60 seconds or 300 seconds) will reduce the number of groups but may obscure important short-term trends.
*   **Data Skew:** If the data is not evenly distributed throughout the time range, some groups may contain significantly more data points than others, leading to biased statistics.
*   **Query Performance:** The number of groups directly impacts the query's performance. A large number of groups will require more processing and memory.
*   **Use Case Specificity:** The optimal value will depend on the specific analytical use case.  For example, short-term anomaly detection might require a smaller interval, while long-term trend analysis might be better suited for a larger interval.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider how the parameter handles data points that fall exactly on the boundary of a time interval.
