These lines of code are constructing the text response that will be sent back to Dialogflow, which will then be spoken or displayed to the user.

*   `text.setText(List.of("Boiler Temperatur ist "+heatPumpDataService.getCurrent().getBoilerTemp()));` This line sets the text content of the response message. It's constructing a string that includes the current boiler temperature. `heatPumpDataService.getCurrent().getBoilerTemp()` retrieves the current boiler temperature from the `HeatPumpDataService`. This value is then concatenated into the string "Boiler Temperatur ist ...". `List.of()` creates an immutable list containing this single string.
*   `msg.setText(text);` This line sets the text of the `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage` object (`msg`) to the `text` object that was just created. This essentially associates the text we constructed with the response message.

Therefore, the response will include a message stating "Boiler Temperatur ist [current boiler temperature]", where `[current boiler temperature]` is the value retrieved from the `HeatPumpDataService`.
