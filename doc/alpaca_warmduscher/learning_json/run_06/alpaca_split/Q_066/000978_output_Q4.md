Hereâ€™s how I would implement the data types for a concrete class implementing `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats`, along with rationales and missing data handling:

*   **`measurementDateStart` and `measurementDateEnd`:** `java.util.Date` (or `java.time.LocalDateTime` if using Java 8+). This is the natural choice for representing dates and times. It allows for precise tracking of the measurement window. The use of `java.time.LocalDateTime` is preferable as it offers a more modern and robust API.
*   **`soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`:** `Double`.  The average delta likely won't be a whole number, so a `Double` provides the necessary precision.  A `BigDecimal` could be considered if extremely high precision is needed, but a `Double` is generally sufficient for most analytics scenarios.
*   **`soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`:** `Double`.  Similar to the average, the minimum delta is unlikely to be a whole number, requiring the precision of a `Double`.
*   **`soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`:** `Double`.  Same reasoning as `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg` and `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`.
*   **`compressorState`:** `Boolean`. The compressor is either on or off, making a boolean the most appropriate and efficient data type.
*   **`totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`:** `Integer`. This represents a count of data points, which must be a whole number.  Using `Integer` is appropriate, and an `int` could be used if memory optimization is a concern and the maximum number of probes is known to be within the `int` range.

**Handling Missing Data:**

When data is missing, several approaches can be taken:

1.  **Null Values:** Allow the `Double` values for average, min, and max to be `null`. The calling code would need to check for `null` before using these values. This is a straightforward approach.
2.  **Default Values:** Assign a specific default value (e.g., 0.0) to the `Double` values when data is missing. This simplifies usage but can introduce inaccuracies if the default value is not properly handled. Consider using `OptionalDouble` instead of directly assigning a `Double` to signal the missing data.
3.  **Exception Handling:** Throw an exception if required data is missing. This is appropriate if the absence of data indicates a critical error.
4.  **`compressorState`:** If the compressor state cannot be determined, a `null` value can be used.
5.  **`totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`:** If no probes were recorded, the value would be set to `0`.

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of the application and the importance of data accuracy. For analytics purposes, allowing `null` values or using `OptionalDouble` and handling them gracefully in the calling code is generally a good practice.
