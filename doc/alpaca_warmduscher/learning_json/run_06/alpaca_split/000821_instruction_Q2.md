For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/SessionRequestRepository.java' with name 'SessionRequestRepository.java'... 
Assuming `SessionRequest` entity has a field called `status` of type `String`, how would you add a method to find all `SessionRequest` entities with a specific status using Spring Data JPA's derived query methods? Write the method signature you would add to the interface.
