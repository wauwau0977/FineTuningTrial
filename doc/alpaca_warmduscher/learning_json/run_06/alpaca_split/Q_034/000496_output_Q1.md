Using a class like `MeteoSwissEntity` provides several benefits over a plain JavaScript object:

*   **Type Safety:** TypeScript's type system enforces that the object always has the expected properties and types, reducing runtime errors.
*   **Encapsulation:** Although not fully utilized here, a class allows for the future addition of methods to encapsulate logic related to the data (e.g., calculating derived values or validating data).
*   **Code Organization and Readability:** A class clearly defines the structure of the data, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Reusability and Extensibility:** The class can be easily reused throughout the application and extended with new properties or methods as needed.

However, there are also drawbacks:

*   **Complexity:** Creating and maintaining a class is more complex than simply using a plain JavaScript object.
*   **Boilerplate:**  A class requires more code to define (constructor, properties, etc.).
*   **Potential Overhead:** In some cases, using a class might introduce a slight performance overhead, although this is usually negligible.

In this specific case, given the relatively simple structure of the data and the use of TypeScript, the benefits of using a class (type safety, organization) likely outweigh the drawbacks. If the data were even simpler and type safety wasn't a major concern, a plain object might be sufficient. But for data with a clear structure and potential for future expansion, a class is a good choice.
