For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java' with name 'MyStartUpListener.java'... How does this listener impact the overall application startup time?  What considerations should be made to ensure it doesn't introduce a significant performance bottleneck?
