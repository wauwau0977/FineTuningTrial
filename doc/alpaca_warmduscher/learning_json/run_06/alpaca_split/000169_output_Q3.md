The `LocationStrategy` provider, when set to `HashLocationStrategy`, affects how Angular's router handles navigation and updates the browser's URL. The `HashLocationStrategy` uses the hash fragment (`#`) in the URL to represent the current route. For example, a route to '/dashboard' would be represented as `/#/dashboard`.

The default `PathLocationStrategy` uses the actual path of the URL (e.g., `/dashboard`). 

The primary reason for using `HashLocationStrategy` is to ensure compatibility with servers that aren't configured to handle direct routing to the application's views.  If a server isn't configured to correctly route requests for paths like `/dashboard`, the application won't work as expected.  The `HashLocationStrategy` works because the browser handles the hash fragment on the client side, so the server doesn't need to be aware of the application's routing. However, it results in less user-friendly URLs with the '#' symbol.  If the server *is* correctly configured, `PathLocationStrategy` is generally preferred for cleaner URLs.
