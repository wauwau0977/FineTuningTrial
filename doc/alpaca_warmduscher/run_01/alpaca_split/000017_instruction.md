You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class, `InfoBean`, serves as a container for application information, specifically the device name, build timestamp, and build version of the 'Warmduscher' THServer. It leverages Spring's `@Component` annotation for dependency injection and `@Value` to inject properties from the application configuration. The class provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the contained information, as well as a `toString()` method for easy debugging and logging.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java
- **Class Name(s):** `InfoBean`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Holds and provides access to application metadata (device name, build timestamp, build version).
- **User Inputs & Outputs:** No direct user input. Outputs are the values contained within the bean, accessed via getter methods.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The class primarily functions as a data holder. Values are injected via Spring configuration and can be retrieved through the provided getter methods.
- **External Interactions:** Reads values from the application configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) through Spring's `@Value` annotation.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - Empty or missing configuration values will result in default (empty string) values for the corresponding bean properties. There is no explicit error handling within the class itself; the application configuration framework will likely handle missing properties.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  Minimal impact on performance as it is a simple data-holding class. Accessing properties is a fast operation.
- **Scalability:**  The class itself is not a scalability bottleneck. Scalability will depend on the underlying application architecture.
- **Security:** No direct security implications.  The security of the information held within the bean depends on the applicationâ€™s overall security measures.
- **Maintainability:** The class is simple and well-structured, making it easy to maintain and modify.  The use of getter/setter methods promotes encapsulation.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The class is reliable and available as long as the Spring application context is initialized correctly and the configuration properties are accessible.
- **Usability:** Easy to use and integrate as it is a simple Java bean.
- **Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements are apparent for this class.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `getDeviceName()`: Returns the device name.
    - `setDeviceName(String deviceName)`: Sets the device name.
    - `getBuildTimestampServer()`: Returns the build timestamp.
    - `setBuildTimestampServer(String buildTimestampServer)`: Sets the build timestamp.
    - `getBuildVersionServer()`: Returns the build version.
    - `setBuildVersionServer(String buildVersionServer)`: Sets the build version.
    - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the bean's contents for debugging.
- **Important logic flows:** The class does not contain complex logic flows. It primarily uses getter and setter methods.
- **Error handling:** No explicit error handling.
- **Classes:**  No subclasses defined.
- **Modules:** The class belongs to the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean` package, which likely represents the information service module within the THServer application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: Strings
- Basic Java operations

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework:**
    - `@Component`: Used for dependency injection within the Spring application context.
    - `@Value`: Used to inject values from the application configuration file.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None apparent in this specific code snippet. However, the class is likely used in conjunction with other modules within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** Not applicable. The class is already lightweight and efficient.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already fairly readable. No immediate improvements are needed.
- **Security Improvements:** No apparent security risks.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The class itself doesn't present scalability concerns. Scalability concerns will be addressed at the overall application level. Consider caching the bean if frequent access is required and the configuration values are static.
