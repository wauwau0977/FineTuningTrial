Angular's Flexbox layout, powered by Angular Material's Layout module (`fxLayout`), allows for creating responsive and flexible layouts.  In this case, `fxFlex.gt-xs="50"` applies a flex item property that determines how much space this `div` should occupy within its flex container.

`fxFlex.gt-xs="50"` means: "On screens *greater than* extra-small (xs), this flex item should take up 50% of the available space in the flex container."  The `gt-xs` is a media query breakpoint that activates the style only when the screen width is larger than the xs breakpoint (typically around 599px).

On extra-small screens (less than 599px), the `fxFlex.gt-xs` style is *not* applied.  The parent `div` uses `fxLayout.xs="column"`, causing the elements to stack vertically. This likely means that on smaller screens, the two temperature displays will be displayed one above the other, filling the full width of the container.  On larger screens, the `fxFlex.gt-xs="50"` style is applied, arranging the two temperature displays side-by-side, each taking up half of the available width. This creates a two-column layout on larger screens.
