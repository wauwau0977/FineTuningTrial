`beforeEach` is a function in Jasmine (the default testing framework for Angular) that defines a block of code to be executed *before each* `it` block (i.e., each test case) within the `describe` block.

Within this `beforeEach` block:
1. `fixture = TestBed.createComponent(BoilerChartComponent);` creates a testing fixture for the `BoilerChartComponent`. This sets up an isolated instance of the component.
2. `component = fixture.componentInstance;` obtains a reference to the actual component instance that was created.
3. `fixture.detectChanges();` triggers change detection on the component. This is crucial because Angular's change detection mechanism updates the view based on changes to component properties. It ensures that the component's view reflects the initial state before each test runs.

This code is important to run before each test case because it ensures that each test starts with a clean, consistent, and initialized component instance. Without it, tests might inadvertently depend on the state of previous tests, leading to unreliable and flaky test results.
