If enabled, the `jsonCustomizer` bean would customize the `ObjectMapper` used by Jackson (the JSON serialization/deserialization library) to handle date and time serialization. It would:

1.  Set the default date/time format for all dates and times serialized as strings to match the `dateTimeFormat` (ISO_DATE_TIME).
2.  Register `LocalDateSerializer` and `LocalDateTimeSerializer` to serialize `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects specifically using the defined `dateFormat` and `dateTimeFormat` instances, respectively.

Currently, it’s commented out, implying the developers may have chosen a different approach to handle JSON serialization. Perhaps they're using the formatters registered with the `FormattingConversionService` through Jackson’s integration with Spring’s conversion service, or they’ve decided a global default format isn't desirable and prefer handling formatting on a per-object basis.

The benefits of using `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer` include:

*   **Centralized Configuration:** Provides a single place to configure Jackson for date/time handling, improving maintainability.
*   **Type-Specific Formatting:** Allows different formatting for different date/time types (e.g., `LocalDate` vs. `LocalDateTime`).
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that all dates and times serialized to JSON follow the specified format.
*   **Integration with Spring:** Leverages Spring’s dependency injection and configuration mechanisms.
