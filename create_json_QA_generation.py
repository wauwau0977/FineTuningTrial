             ######################## QUESTION 1 ########################
            f"""
            Your task is to write an IT specification for the given source code class below, which is part of the project '{self.project_name}'. 
            The IT specification shall follow the structure below. If an item of the spec is not applicable just leave it empty.

            # IT Specification

            ## 1. Summary
            Provide a clear summary of the code purpose and functionality.

            ## 2. File Information
            - **File Location:** (Specify the file path)
            - **Class Name(s):** (List relevant class names)

            ## 3. Functional Requirements
            This section defines the expected behavior and core functionalities of the code. Functional requirements should specify:
            - **Primary Operations**: What the code is designed to do.
            - **User Inputs & Outputs**: Expected inputs and corresponding outputs.
            - **Workflow/Logic**: Steps or processes involved.
            - **External Interactions**: API calls, database queries, file operations, or UI interactions.
            - **Edge Cases Handling**: Expected behavior in different scenarios, including errors.

            ## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
            This section defines the quality attributes and constraints of the system, including:
            - **Performance**: Expected execution time, response time, or memory usage.
            - **Scalability**: How well the system handles increased load.
            - **Security**: Authentication, encryption, data protection.
            - **Maintainability**: Code structure, modularity, ease of modification.
            - **Reliability & Availability**: Expected uptime and fault tolerance.
            - **Usability**: How easy it is to use or integrate.
            - **Compliance**: Industry standards or legal requirements.

            ## 5. Key Components
            Break down the main components of the code, including:
            - Functions: Give a quick description of what each function is doing
            - Important logic flows
            - Error handling
            - Classes: are there any subclasses defined?
            - Modules

            ## 6. Dependencies

            ### 6.1 Core Language Features
            List the built-in language features and standard libraries used, e.g.:
            - Data structures (lists, maps, sets, etc.)
            - File handling
            - Concurrency/threading

            ### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
            List external dependencies along with their purpose, e.g.:
            - **Spring Boot** - Used for dependency injection and web service handling.
            - **Lodash** - Provides utility functions for array and object manipulation.

            ### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
            List internal project dependencies with explanations, e.g.:
            - **`com.myproject.utils.StringHelper`** - Provides string manipulation functions.
            - **`myproject.database.DbConnector`** - Handles database connectivity.

            ## 7. Potential Improvements
            Suggest improvements or optimizations, such as:
            - **Performance Enhancements:** Identify possible bottlenecks.
            - **Code Readability:** Refactor large functions into smaller, reusable units.
            - **Security Improvements:** Highlight potential security risks.
            - **Scalability Considerations:** Recommend changes for future scalability.
