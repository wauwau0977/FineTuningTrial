The styling rule `.boilerTemp margin-left: 10px` adds a left margin of 10 pixels to any HTML element with the class "boilerTemp".

Based on the class name, I would expect this to be applied to an element displaying the boiler temperature.  This could be a `<span>`, `<div>`, or other container displaying a temperature value (e.g., "70Â°C").

It contributes to the overall visual layout by creating some visual spacing between the temperature value and any adjacent element, such as a label ("Boiler Temperature:") or another data point. This improves readability and prevents the temperature value from being directly crammed against the neighboring content. It likely serves to visually group the temperature value with the related label or context.
