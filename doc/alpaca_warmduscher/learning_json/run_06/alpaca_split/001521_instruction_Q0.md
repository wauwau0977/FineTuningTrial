You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code provides a unit test for the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` method. The test verifies the method's output for specific temperature and humidity input values, asserting that the calculated absolute humidity falls within expected ranges. The purpose is to ensure the correctness of the approximation formula used to calculate absolute humidity.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java
- **Class Name(s):** `PhysicsTest`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: The code's primary operation is to execute a series of unit tests for the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` method.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This is a test class, so there is no direct user input. The "inputs" are the temperature and humidity values passed to the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` method within the tests.  The output is a series of assertions that determine if the calculated absolute humidity is within the expected range. Console output displays the calculated absolute humidity for each test case.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The test executes three distinct test cases. Each case calls `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` with specific temperature and humidity values. The calculated absolute humidity is then asserted to be within a predefined range using `assertTrue()`.  The printed `System.out.println()` statements help in debugging but aren't crucial to the functionality.
- **External Interactions**: No external interactions (e.g., database, API calls, file operations) are present in this test class. It relies entirely on the internal `Physics` class.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  No explicit edge case handling is present within this test class. The tests focus on a limited range of input values. More comprehensive testing would require boundary and negative testing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:  Performance is not a critical requirement for this unit test. The test execution should be reasonably fast for development purposes.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability is not relevant for a unit test.
- **Security**: Security is not relevant for a unit test.
- **Maintainability**: The test code is relatively straightforward and easy to understand, promoting maintainability. 
- **Reliability & Availability**: Reliability is important for ensuring that tests consistently pass or fail based on the code's correctness.
- **Usability**: The test is designed for developers and is easily runnable within a standard Java development environment.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are identified.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()`: (within `Physics` class - not shown in source) This is the method being tested, and calculates approximate absolute humidity.
    - The test cases each call the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` function and `assertTrue()` to verify the results.
- **Important logic flows**: The main logic is a series of assertions. The test is passing or failing based on these.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling exists within the test. Exceptions thrown by `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` would cause the test to fail.
- **Classes**: The code defines a single test class `PhysicsTest`. No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The test is self-contained within the `PhysicsTest` class and relies on the `Physics` class.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures (primarily doubles)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Control flow statements (e.g., curly braces for code blocks)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **JUnit Jupiter**: Used for writing and executing unit tests. Specifically, the following are used:
    - `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`
    - `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` (including `assertTrue`)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Physics`**: This is the class containing the method being tested.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**: Not applicable to a unit test.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable.  Comments could be added to clarify the purpose of each test case.
- **Security Improvements**: Not applicable to a unit test.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable to a unit test.
- **More Comprehensive Testing**: The current tests cover only a limited range of input values. Adding tests for boundary conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, zero humidity) and invalid inputs (e.g., negative values) would improve the test coverage and robustness. Consider using parameterized tests to simplify adding multiple test cases with different input values.
- **Test Doubles/Mocking**: If `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` had dependencies on external resources, mock those to improve testability and avoid external factors influencing the tests. However this is not present in this example.
