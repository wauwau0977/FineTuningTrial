Ideally, this file should contain **integration tests** that verify the interaction of various components of the `thserver` application.  These tests should focus on ensuring that the application's core functionality works as expected when all the pieces are put together â€“ for example, testing the interaction between controllers, services, and data repositories. They should test the entire stack, although potentially with mocked external dependencies.

Here's why:

* **`@SpringBootTest` is heavy:**  The `@SpringBootTest` annotation loads the entire Spring application context. This makes it relatively slow. Therefore, using it for numerous, fast-running **unit tests** would be inefficient.
* **Integration focus:**  The purpose of integration tests is to verify the interactions between different parts of the application. The `@SpringBootTest` annotation is well-suited for this.

**Tests to avoid in this file:**

* **Unit tests:** Unit tests should be isolated and fast, testing individual components in isolation. They should be written using mocking frameworks (like Mockito) and should not require the entire Spring application context to be loaded. These are better suited for separate test classes.
* **Slow or complex tests:** Tests that involve external systems (databases, APIs, file systems) and take a long time to run should be avoided or minimized in this file. Consider using test containers or mocking external dependencies to speed up the tests.
* **Tests that are brittle:** Tests that depend heavily on the implementation details of the application can be fragile and prone to breaking when the implementation changes. Focus on testing the behavior of the application, not the specific implementation.
