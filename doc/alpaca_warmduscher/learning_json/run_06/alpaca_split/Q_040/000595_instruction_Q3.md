For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...

```typescript
 beforeEach(async () => {
   await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
     declarations: [OverviewCurrentComponent]
   })
   .compileComponents();
 });
```

Explain the role of `TestBed.configureTestingModule` and `.compileComponents()` within the `beforeEach` block. Why are these operations performed before each test case?
