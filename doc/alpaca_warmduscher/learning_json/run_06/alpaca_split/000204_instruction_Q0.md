You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code provides a basic unit test suite for the `HeatingDataService` class within the 'Warmduscher' project. The test verifies that an instance of `HeatingDataService` can be successfully created.  It doesn't implement any functional logic itself but confirms the service is instantiable.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts
- **Class Name(s):** HeatingDataService

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**:  The code's primary operation is to verify the creation of a `HeatingDataService` instance.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: There are no user inputs or outputs. This is a unit test, operating entirely within the testing framework.
- **Workflow/Logic**: 
    1. The `beforeEach` block configures the Angular testing module.
    2. `TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService)` creates an instance of the service.
    3. The `it` block asserts that the created `service` instance is truthy (not null or undefined).
- **External Interactions**: None. This is a purely in-memory test.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The test implicitly handles the edge case of the service not being properly defined or failing to instantiate, by expecting a truthy value.  If instantiation fails, the `expect` assertion would fail.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Not applicable; the test executes very quickly.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable; this is a unit test.
- **Security**: Not applicable.
- **Maintainability**: The test is simple and easy to understand, contributing to maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The test is reliable as long as the Angular testing environment is correctly configured.
- **Usability**:  Easy to integrate into a CI/CD pipeline and run as part of automated testing.
- **Compliance**: N/A

## 5. Key Components
- **`describe('CurrentDataService', ...)`**:  Defines a test suite for the `CurrentDataService` (note: the class name in the test suite name does not match the class name in the file itself - potential bug).
- **`beforeEach(...)`**: Sets up the testing environment before each test case. Configures the Angular testing module.
- **`TestBed.configureTestingModule({})`**: Configures the Angular testing module with necessary dependencies (currently empty).
- **`TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService)`**:  Injects an instance of `HeatingDataService` into the `service` variable.
- **`it('should be created', ...)`**: Defines a single test case to verify that the service can be created.
- **`expect(service).toBeTruthy()`**: Asserts that the created `service` instance is truthy.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript syntax
- Object instantiation

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular (TestBed)**: Angular's testing utilities are used to configure and inject dependencies for testing.
- **Jasmine/JEST** (implicit): Angular tests usually use Jasmine or JEST as the test runner and assertion library.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- The test assumes the existence of the `HeatingDataService` class within the project.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Correct Class Name**: The test suite is named after `CurrentDataService` but is intended for testing `HeatingDataService`.  This should be corrected.
- **Add More Tests**:  This is a very basic test. The `HeatingDataService` likely has methods and properties that should be tested to ensure proper functionality.  Tests should be added to cover all core functionalities of the service.
- **Mock Dependencies**: If `HeatingDataService` depends on other services or data sources (e.g., an API), those dependencies should be mocked to isolate the service under test and avoid external factors affecting the test results.
- **Configure Testing Module**: The `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})` is currently empty. It should be populated with any necessary dependencies or configurations required by the `HeatingDataService`. This might include mock providers for other services.
- **Test Coverage**: Analyze the `HeatingDataService` code and add tests to achieve higher code coverage.
