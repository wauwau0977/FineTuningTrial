You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class, `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`, represents a data entity for storing meteorological statistics obtained from MeteoSwiss. It holds information such as temperature, wind speed, measurement dates, station ID, and station name. The class is designed to be persisted in a database, likely as part of a time-series data store, and marked as immutable to prevent accidental modifications after creation.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Represents meteorological statistics from MeteoSwiss for storage and retrieval.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This class does not handle direct user inputs or outputs. It serves as a data transfer object/entity for database interaction. Inputs are provided via setter methods during object creation/population, and outputs are the objectâ€™s data available through getter methods.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The class primarily functions as a container for meteorological data. Data is set via setter methods and can be retrieved via getter methods.  The `id` is generated automatically using `UUIDUtils`.
- **External Interactions**: The class interacts with the database through an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Hibernate. The `@Entity` annotation indicates this class maps to a database table.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The `@Immutable` annotation helps to prevent data modification after object creation, adding a layer of data integrity. There isn't explicit error handling within the class itself, but the ORM and database will handle data type validation and constraints. Null values are allowed for all double and Date types.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The class itself has minimal performance overhead, as it is a simple data container. Database access performance depends on the database configuration and indexing.
- **Scalability**: The class is scalable as it only represents data. Scalability concerns primarily relate to the underlying database and ORM.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within the class. Data security is handled by the database and application-level access controls.
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and easy to maintain. The use of standard getter and setter methods promotes readability and consistency.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class itself does not directly impact reliability or availability. These are determined by the database and application infrastructure.
- **Usability**: The class is usable as a data model within the application.
- **Compliance**: Dependent on data privacy regulations regarding meteorological data (if applicable).

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - **Getters & Setters:** Standard getter and setter methods for all instance variables.
    - **ID Generation:** The `id` is generated upon object creation using `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()`.
- **Important logic flows**: The primary logic is setting data via setters and retrieving data via getters.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: This class belongs to the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss` package and is part of the data persistence layer.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Java Data Types:** Uses primitive data types like `Double`, `Date`, and `String`.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:**  Implements encapsulation using private instance variables and public getter/setter methods.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Hibernate**: Used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) as indicated by the `@Entity` annotation.
- **UUIDUtils**: A custom utility class (presumably within the project) for generating UUIDs.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`UUIDUtils`**:  Handles the generation of unique identifiers for each entity.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**:  If a large volume of data is processed, consider using more efficient data types or caching mechanisms.
- **Code Readability**: The class is already relatively readable, but consider adding Javadoc comments to each field and method for better documentation.
- **Security Improvements**: No immediate security concerns, but ensure appropriate database access controls are in place.
- **Scalability Considerations**: The class is scalable, but database optimization and appropriate indexing are crucial for handling large volumes of data.  Consider the long-term storage requirements and potential use of time-series databases.
