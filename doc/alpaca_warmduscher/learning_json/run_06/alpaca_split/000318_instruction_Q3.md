For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';
describe('AboutComponent', () => {
  let component: AboutComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<AboutComponent>;
```

What is the purpose of importing `ComponentFixture` and `TestBed` from `@angular/core/testing` in this test suite? Explain how these are typically used within an Angular component test.
