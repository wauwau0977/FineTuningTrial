Extending `CrudRepository` provides a suite of pre-built methods for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `SessionDevice` entity without requiring any explicit implementation. Specifically, it automatically provides methods like `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`, `count()`, `deleteById()`, and `delete()`.  These methods handle the interaction with the underlying database, simplifying data access logic and reducing boilerplate code.  The framework (Spring Data JPA) generates the necessary SQL queries based on the entity definition and method signatures.
