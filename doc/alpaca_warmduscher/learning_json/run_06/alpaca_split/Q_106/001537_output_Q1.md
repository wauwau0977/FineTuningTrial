Using a named constant like `UUIDUtils.EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` offers several significant benefits over hardcoding the length:

1. **Readability & Maintainability:** The constant name clearly conveys the *meaning* of the expected length, making the test more understandable. If the expected length changes in the future, it only needs to be updated in one place—the constant definition—rather than in multiple assertions throughout the test.

2. **Preventing Magic Numbers:** Hardcoding a length (e.g., `assertEquals(10, length)`) introduces a "magic number." Magic numbers are values with unclear meaning, making the code harder to understand and maintain.

3. **Centralized Configuration:** The constant acts as a central configuration point for the expected length. This makes it easier to manage and potentially externalize the configuration (e.g., through a properties file or environment variable) if needed.

4. **Refactoring Safety:** If the length is used in multiple places, changing it through a constant ensures consistency and reduces the risk of introducing errors.

In essence, using a named constant improves code clarity, maintainability, and robustness.
