This listener adds a minimal overhead to the startup time. The operations performed (retrieving a bean and setting a value) are generally fast. However, the impact could become noticeable if the bean retrieval process itself is complex or involves expensive operations. To ensure it doesn't create a bottleneck: 1) Ensure the `StartupData` bean is a simple, lightweight object.  2) Avoid any blocking operations within the `ready()` method. 3) Consider asynchronous operation if populating the `StartupData` doesn't need to block application startup. 4) Profiling the application during startup can help identify any performance issues related to this listener.  A very large number of listeners could also contribute to overall startup time, so minimizing their complexity is important.
