The `describe` block in Angular unit tests is a core part of the Jasmine testing framework. It groups together related tests for a specific component or functionality, in this case, the `OverviewCurrentComponent`.  It's a way to organize and logically structure your tests.  Think of it as defining a "test suite" for that component.

`component` is a variable that holds an *instance* of the `OverviewCurrentComponent`.  During the test, this is the actual component you'll interact with and assert things about (e.g., its properties, methods, or output).  It's created by `fixture.componentInstance`.

`fixture` is an instance of `ComponentFixture`, which provides a testing environment for the component. It allows you to:

*   Create the component instance.
*   Detect changes to the component (triggering Angular's change detection).
*   Access the component instance (through `fixture.componentInstance`).
*   Access the component's DOM element.
*   Trigger events on the component.
*   Dispose of the component when the test is finished.

Essentially, `fixture` sets up the environment and provides the tools to interact with and test the `component`. Together, they form the core of how you verify the behavior of your Angular components in unit tests.
