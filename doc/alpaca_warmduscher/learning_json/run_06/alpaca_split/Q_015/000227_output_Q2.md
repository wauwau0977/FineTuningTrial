The `getMeteoSwissHistorical` method constructs a comma-separated string of `stationIds` to be used as a parameter in the HTTP request. While this approach works for a small number of stations, it has significant performance implications and potential limitations when dealing with a very large `stationIds` set.

**Potential Performance Implications:**

1. **String Concatenation:** Building a long string by repeatedly concatenating strings is inefficient in JavaScript. The string is recreated on each iteration.
2. **URL Length Limit:** HTTP requests have a maximum URL length limit (typically around 2048 characters). A very large number of `stationIds` could easily exceed this limit, resulting in truncated requests or errors.
3. **Server-Side Processing:** Passing a long list of `stationIds` as a single parameter might overwhelm the server-side application, potentially leading to performance degradation or errors. The server would have to parse and process a very long string.
4. **Memory Usage:**  Creating and storing a very large string in memory can consume significant resources.

**Improvements:**

1. **Array Instead of String:** Instead of constructing a comma-separated string, send the `stationIds` as an array in the request body (e.g., as JSON). This avoids the URL length limit and allows the server to process the data more efficiently. This would require changing the server-side API to accept an array of station IDs.
2. **Pagination/Chunking:** If sending a large array is still problematic, implement pagination or chunking on the server side.  The client can send requests for subsets of `stationIds` and combine the results.
3. **Limit the Number of Stations:** Impose a reasonable limit on the maximum number of `stationIds` that can be requested at once.  Inform the user if they attempt to exceed the limit.
4. **Efficient String Building (If String is Necessary):** If using a string is unavoidable, use a more efficient string building technique, such as joining an array of strings using `Array.join(',')`.

Here's an example of how the code could be improved by sending the `stationIds` as an array:

```typescript
getMeteoSwissHistorical(evictCache: boolean, from: Moment, to: Moment, maxRows: number, groupEveryNthSecon: number, stationIds?: Set<string>, doNotCache?: boolean) {
  let p = new HttpParams()
    .set('start', from.toJSON())
    .set('end', to.toJSON())
    .set('maxRows', maxRows)
    .set('groupEveryNthSecon', groupEveryNthSecon)
  ;

  const stationIdArray = Array.from(stationIds); // Convert Set to Array
  // Instead of adding stationIds to HttpParams, send the array in the request body
  // The server-side API would need to be updated to handle an array of stationIds
  // Example:
  // return this.http.post(this.serviceBaseURL + '/meteo-swiss/getBetweenDates', { params: p, stationIds: stationIdArray });

  // Or, if sending via HttpParams is necessary, limit the number of stations.
  if (stationIds && stationIds.size > 100) {
    console.warn("Too many station IDs requested. Limiting to 100.");
    //Limit the stationIds to 100 or some other reasonable number
  }
  if (stationIds != null) {
    p = p.set('stationId', Array.from(stationIds).join(','));
  }
  return this.cacheService.get(
    HeatingDataService.CACHE_KEY_METEO_HISTORICAL,
    () => this.http.get(this.serviceBaseURL + '/meteo-swiss/getBetweenDates', {params: p}),
    evictCache, doNotCache);
}
```

Sending the `stationIds` as an array in the request body is the most robust and scalable solution.  If that's not possible, implementing a limit on the number of stations is a reasonable compromise.
