For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java' with name 'HeatPumpRepository.java'... 
Suppose you are using Spring Data JPA. How could you leverage Spring Data JPA's capabilities (e.g., derived queries or dynamic queries) to achieve the same functionality as the `getHeatPumpMeasurements` method without writing a custom `@Query` annotation with a native SQL query? Consider how to handle the grouping by `group_every_nth_second`.
