This class utilizes constructor-based dependency injection.  Two dependencies are injected via the constructor: `MeteoDataService` and `MeteoSwissRepository`. These are interfaces/classes responsible for fetching the meteorological data and persisting it to the database, respectively.

This approach provides several benefits.  Firstly, it improves testability.  During unit testing, mock implementations of `MeteoDataService` and `MeteoSwissRepository` can be easily injected, allowing for isolated testing of the `MeteoDataPoller`'s logic without relying on external systems or databases. Secondly, it enhances maintainability and decoupling. Changes to the implementation of `MeteoDataService` or `MeteoSwissRepository` won't require modifications to `MeteoDataPoller` as long as the interfaces remain consistent. This promotes loose coupling and allows for easier refactoring and code changes.  Finally, it adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, making the code more flexible and adaptable.
