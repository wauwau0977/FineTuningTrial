The `getMeasurements` method retrieves time-series measurement data for a heat pump, enabling analysis of its performance over a given period.

**Parameters:**

*   `measurementDateStart`: A `Date` object representing the beginning of the requested measurement period.
*   `measurementDateEnd`: A `Date` object representing the end of the requested measurement period.
*   `maxRows`: An integer defining the maximum number of measurement records to return. This acts as a limit to prevent overly large result sets.
*   `groupEveryNthScond`: An integer specifying the grouping interval in seconds.  Measurements falling within the same second (or grouping interval) are aggregated.

**Query Construction & Data Retrieval:**

The method constructs a database query (likely using JPQL/HQL) to select `Measurement` entities. The `WHERE` clause of the query filters the measurements based on the provided `measurementDateStart` and `measurementDateEnd`, ensuring only measurements within the specified time range are considered.

The core functionality involves grouping the retrieved measurements.  The query likely uses a database-specific grouping function (e.g., `DATE_TRUNC` in PostgreSQL or similar) to group measurements based on `groupEveryNthScond`. This is done *before* any other filtering or ordering. The purpose of this grouping is to reduce the granularity of the data. For example, if `groupEveryNthScond` is 60, the query will return one measurement record for each minute (60-second interval) containing an aggregated value.

**Maximum Row Limit Handling:**

The `maxRows` parameter is used to limit the total number of results returned by the query. This is achieved through the addition of a `LIMIT` clause (or equivalent) to the query *after* the grouping and filtering.

**Return Value:**

The method returns a `List<Measurement>` containing the retrieved and potentially grouped measurement records. The list will contain no more than `maxRows` elements. The `Measurement` objects likely contain aggregated data if `groupEveryNthScond` is greater than zero.
