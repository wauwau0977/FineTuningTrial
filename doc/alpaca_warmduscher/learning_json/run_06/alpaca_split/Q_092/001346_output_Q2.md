The current `isSessionRelevantRequest` method utilizes `Stream.of(...).noneMatch()` to exclude various file extensions and paths. While functional, this approach has several potential drawbacks as the application grows:

*   **Maintainability:** Adding or removing exclusions requires modifying the stream definition directly.  This can become cumbersome and error-prone with a large number of exclusions.  It's harder to read and understand at a glance what's being excluded.
*   **Performance:** While likely not a significant issue in most cases, creating a stream and iterating through its elements for each request adds a small overhead compared to other approaches.
*   **Readability:** The long chain of `StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase` and `StringUtils.equals` calls can make the code less readable.

A more maintainable alternative is to utilize a `Set` to store the excluded paths and file extensions. This provides faster lookup and easier modification. Hereâ€™s an example:

```java
private static final Set<String> EXCLUDED_PATHS = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
        "/", "/pi11", "/pi11/",
        ".html", ".htm", ".css", ".png", ".svg", ".woff", ".woff2", ".json", ".js"
));

public static boolean isSessionRelevantRequest(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String path = request.getRequestURI();
    if (path == null) {
        return false;
    }

    if (EXCLUDED_PATHS.stream().anyMatch(path::endsWith)) {
        return false;
    }
    if(StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase(request.getMethod(), HttpMethod.OPTIONS.name())) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Easy Modification:** Adding or removing exclusions simply involves adding or removing elements from the `EXCLUDED_PATHS` set.
*   **Improved Readability:** The code is more concise and easier to understand.
*   **Potentially Better Performance:** `Set` lookups are typically faster than iterating through a stream.

Using a `Set` makes the code more scalable and maintainable in the long run.
