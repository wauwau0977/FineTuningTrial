Using a static property (`standardIntervals`) to store the list of intervals has both advantages and disadvantages compared to a class-level (non-static) property:

**Advantages of Static Property:**

*   **Memory Efficiency:** The `standardIntervals` array is created only once, regardless of how many instances of `UtilsServiceService` are created. This saves memory, particularly if the list is large.
*   **Simplified Access:** The list is easily accessible from anywhere in the application using `UtilsServiceService.getStandardIntervals()`, without needing to create an instance of the service.
*   **Global Availability:**  It effectively acts as a constant list available throughout the application.

**Disadvantages of Static Property:**

*   **Testing Challenges:** Static properties can make unit testing more difficult. Mocking or overriding static properties can be more complex than working with instance properties.
*   **Reduced Flexibility:**  It's harder to dynamically modify or replace the list of intervals at runtime.  If the application needs to support different configurations or dynamically update the interval options, a static property makes this challenging.
* **Hidden Dependency:**  It creates a hidden dependency, making it less obvious that the service relies on this statically held data.

If the list of intervals is truly constant and never needs to change, a static property is a reasonable choice. However, if there's any possibility that the intervals might need to be modified or configured at runtime, a class-level property instantiated with the service would be more flexible and testable. Instantiating the service creates a dedicated instance of the interval list, allowing it to be unique per service instance if needed.
