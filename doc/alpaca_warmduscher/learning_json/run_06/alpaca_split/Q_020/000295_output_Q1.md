Using a very light color (nearly transparent) and extremely small font size for the `.buildTimestamp` class has significant accessibility implications. Users with visual impairments, including those with low vision or color blindness, may struggle to read this information. It also presents challenges for screen readers, which might not properly interpret such subtle styling. I would recommend increasing the contrast between the text color and the background, and increasing the font size to at least a more readable size (e.g., small or medium).  Consider using a more standard font weight to improve legibility.  Alternatively, if the build timestamp is not crucial information for all users, consider hiding it entirely for accessibility or providing a more prominent and accessible alternative way to view this information if needed.  Accessibility checks with tools like WAVE can help identify further issues.
