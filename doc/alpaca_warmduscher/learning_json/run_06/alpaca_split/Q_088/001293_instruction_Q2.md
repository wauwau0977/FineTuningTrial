For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java'... 
The line `response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, *, X-Requested-With");` seems potentially problematic. Why might the inclusion of "*" in this header be considered a security risk or a bad practice? What would be a better, more secure approach to define the allowed headers?
