`@RequestMapping` and `@ResponseBody` are critical annotations for building RESTful web services using Spring MVC.

*   **`@RequestMapping`**: This annotation maps incoming HTTP requests to specific handler methods within the controller. It specifies the URL path (e.g., `/heatpump-data/current`) that will trigger the execution of the associated method. It can also specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). In this class, `@RequestMapping("/heatpump-data")` indicates that all methods in the class handle requests starting with `/heatpump-data`.  Subsequent `@RequestMapping` annotations within each method then refine the URL mapping.

*   **`@ResponseBody`**: This annotation indicates that the return value of the handler method should be serialized and written directly to the HTTP response body. It's commonly used in conjunction with `@RequestMapping` to create REST APIs where data is exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.  Without `@ResponseBody`, Spring MVC would typically try to resolve the return value to a view name (for rendering a template).

**How they contribute to the architecture:**

*   **Separation of Concerns:** They separate the handling of incoming requests from the business logic. The controller receives requests and delegates the processing to the service layer.
*   **RESTful API:** They enable the creation of a RESTful API by mapping URLs to specific resources and handling requests with standard HTTP methods.
*   **Data Serialization:** `@ResponseBody` handles the serialization of data into a format suitable for transmission over the network (typically JSON).
*   **Loose Coupling:** The annotations facilitate loose coupling between the client and the server, as the client only needs to know the URL and the data format.
*   **Testability:** The clear mapping of URLs to methods makes it easier to test the API endpoints.

In essence, `@RequestMapping` defines *what* URL triggers *which* method, and `@ResponseBody` controls *how* the response is formatted and sent back to the client.
