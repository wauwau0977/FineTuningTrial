Using a series of `if/else if` or a `switch` statement to map calculated interval values to string keys has several drawbacks:

1.  **Maintainability:**  If the interval calculation logic or the number of possible intervals changes, the `if/else if` or `switch` statement needs to be modified. This makes the code less maintainable, especially if the conditions become complex.
2.  **Scalability:** As the number of possible intervals increases, the `if/else if` chain or `switch` statement becomes unwieldy and difficult to read.
3.  **Testability:** Each `if` or `case` condition needs to be explicitly tested, increasing the test suite's complexity.
4.  **Coupling:** The mapping logic is directly embedded within the method, creating tight coupling between the calculation and presentation of the interval.
5.  **Limited Flexibility:** It's difficult to easily introduce new intervals or modify existing mappings without changing the code.  If you wanted to support a new interval type (e.g., "1m"), you would need to add another `if/else if` condition.

A more flexible and maintainable approach would be to use a lookup table (e.g., a Map or a dictionary) to map calculated values to interval keys. This would separate the calculation logic from the presentation logic and make it easier to modify or extend the interval mappings without changing the core calculation code.
