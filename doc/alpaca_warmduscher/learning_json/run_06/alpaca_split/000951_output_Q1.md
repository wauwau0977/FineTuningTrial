The '1' in `NumOfStatisticRecords1` likely indicates that this represents the number of records contributing to *a specific type* of statistic or calculation. It suggests there might be other statistic record counts, potentially for different types of events or data sources. For instance, there could be `NumOfStatisticRecords2`, `NumOfStatisticRecords3`, etc., each representing a different subset of the data used to generate the analytics.

This naming convention has implications for extensibility. While functional, it’s not very descriptive and could become difficult to manage if many similar counters are added. A more descriptive naming scheme—perhaps based on *what* the records represent (e.g., `NumOfValidSensorReadings`, `NumOfErrorRecords`, `NumOfProcessedEvents`)—would be more maintainable and easier to understand in the long run. The current approach also suggests a potentially ad-hoc design rather than a well-planned data model. A better approach might involve a more generalized `getRecordCount()` method and an enum or a separate field to indicate the type of record being counted.
