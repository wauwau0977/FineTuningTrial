Consider this test case: `it('find interval: 1 week 165 data points --> 4h', () => { ... });` Assume the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method calculates the interval based on the number of data points and the duration of the date range.  Hypothetically, if the underlying logic divides the total number of seconds in the date range by the number of data points, what might be the purpose of such a calculation?
