For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/SessionRequestRepository.java' with name 'SessionRequestRepository.java'... 
The interface declares that the repository handles `SessionRequest` entities and uses `String` as the primary key.  What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a `String` as a primary key compared to using a `Long` (or other numeric type)?
