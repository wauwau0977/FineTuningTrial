You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a data class, `MeteoSwissEntity`, representing weather data retrieved from the MeteoSwiss service. It holds information such as station ID, name, temperature, wind speed, and associated date ranges. It also includes static methods for creating empty instances and instances from web service data, handling potential null values and performing date conversions.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Represents and constructs weather data from MeteoSwiss.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
  - **Input**: Raw weather data from the MeteoSwiss web service (as an object), or parameters for creating an instance.
  - **Output**: An instance of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class populated with weather data.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
  1.  The constructor initializes the `MeteoSwissEntity` with the provided data.
  2.  `emptyInstance()` creates an instance with default/empty values.
  3.  `ofWebService()` receives data from the web service, handles potential null data, converts date strings to Date objects using `HeatingDataService.convertDate()`, and constructs a new `MeteoSwissEntity` instance.
- **External Interactions**:
  - **`HeatingDataService.convertDate()`**: This method is called to convert date strings received from the web service into JavaScript `Date` objects.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
  - Handles null or missing web service data by returning an empty instance.  This prevents errors if the web service doesn't return expected fields.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The class construction and static methods should have minimal overhead, as they are likely called frequently during data processing.
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and easy to understand, promoting maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The handling of null values improves the reliability of the data processing pipeline.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - **`constructor(id, stationId, stationName, temperature, temperatureMin, temperatureMax, temperatureMeasureDate, temperatureMeasureDateMin, temperatureMeasureDateMax, windGustSpeed, windGustSpeedMin, windGustSpeedMax, windMeasureDate, windMeasureDateMin, windMeasureDateMax)`**: Initializes a new `MeteoSwissEntity` instance.
    - **`emptyInstance()`**: Returns a new `MeteoSwissEntity` with all fields set to empty or default values.
    - **`ofWebService(data)`**: Creates a `MeteoSwissEntity` from data received from a web service, handling null values and converting dates.
- **Important logic flows**:
    - The `ofWebService` method handles null data and performs data conversion to create a `MeteoSwissEntity` object.
- **Error handling**:
    - Null checks in `ofWebService()` prevents errors when processing incomplete data from the web service.
- **Classes**:
    - No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**:
    - No external modules aside from the dependency in section 6.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: Objects, Dates
- String manipulation

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None directly used within the class definition, but relies on the `HeatingDataService` which might have its own dependencies.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`**: Used for converting date strings to `Date` objects. This service is presumably defined elsewhere in the project and handles the specific date format expected from the MeteoSwiss service.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: None immediately apparent, as the class is relatively simple. However, profiling the application could identify potential bottlenecks related to the `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` method.
- **Code Readability**: The constructor has a large number of parameters. Consider using a dedicated data transfer object (DTO) or a more structured approach if the number of data points grows significantly.
- **Security Improvements**: Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable. This is a data class and does not inherently represent a scalability bottleneck.
