The `setDeviceName` method in the `InfoBean` class is a setter method used to set the value of the `deviceName` field. Its purpose is to allow external code to modify the device name associated with the `InfoBean` object. 

It takes a `String` argument representing the new device name and assigns it to the `deviceName` field of the current object. This allows for dynamic modification of the device name during the runtime of the application.

Here is the exact code for the method:

```java
public void setDeviceName(String deviceName) {
    this.deviceName = deviceName;
}
```
