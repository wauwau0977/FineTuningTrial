The current approach is potentially inefficient due to the synchronous nature of the calls and the nested loops. Each URL call is blocking, meaning the program waits for the response before proceeding. Then, for each station ID, the code iterates through the responses from each URL. This means a station's data isn't complete until all URLs have been queried.

Here are two ways to improve performance:

1. **Asynchronous HTTP Calls:** Instead of using `RestTemplate.getForObject()` synchronously, use `WebClient` (from Spring Webflux) or `CompletableFuture` to make the HTTP requests asynchronously. This allows multiple requests to be in flight simultaneously, reducing the overall time spent waiting for responses. The program can begin processing responses as they arrive, rather than waiting for all requests to complete.

2. **Parallel Stream Processing:**  Instead of the traditional `for` loop iterating through `stationIds`, use a parallel stream:  `stationIds.parallelStream().forEach(...)`. This will distribute the processing of each station's data across multiple threads, potentially significantly reducing the time it takes to build the `MeteoSwissEntity` objects. It is particularly effective when the data processing for each station is independent.

Both approaches would improve performance by reducing the overall execution time, particularly when dealing with a large number of station IDs or slow network connections. They exploit parallelism to maximize resource utilization and minimize waiting time.
