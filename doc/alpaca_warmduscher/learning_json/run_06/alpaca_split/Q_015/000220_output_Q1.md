Using string literals for cache keys is simple and straightforward initially. It’s easy to understand and implement. However, it introduces several potential drawbacks. A common issue is typos – a small mistake in a string literal can lead to cache misses or unexpected behavior. Another issue is refactoring: if you need to rename or change the structure of your data, you'll need to manually update all occurrences of the relevant string literal throughout the codebase, which is error-prone. Furthermore, it lacks type safety; the compiler won't catch mistakes related to the cache key's format or intended use.

To improve maintainability and robustness, several alternatives exist:

1.  **Enums:** Define an enum to represent the different cache keys.  This provides type safety, autocompletion in IDEs, and a central location for managing the keys.  For example:

    ```typescript
    enum CacheKey {
      HISTORICAL = "CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL",
      CURRENT = "CACHE_KEY_CURRENT",
      // ... other keys
    }
    ```

    You'd then use `CacheKey.HISTORICAL` instead of `"CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL"`.

2.  **Constants:** Declare constants with meaningful names for each cache key.  This offers similar benefits to enums, providing a single source of truth and improving readability.

    ```typescript
    const CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL = "CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL";
    ```

3.  **Symbol (ES6):**  Symbols provide truly unique keys. While potentially overkill for this scenario, they guarantee uniqueness and prevent collisions, especially in complex applications.

4.  **Dedicated Cache Key Class/Module:** For more complex caching schemes, consider a dedicated class or module responsible for generating and managing cache keys.  This allows for more sophisticated key generation logic and centralizes cache key management.
