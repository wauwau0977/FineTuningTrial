The `Throwable cause` parameter allows this exception to wrap another exception (or any `Throwable`). This is known as exception chaining. The purpose is to preserve the original exception that led to this `ThException` being thrown, providing a complete history of the error.

By passing the `cause` to the `super(message, cause)` constructor (the `RuntimeException` constructor), the original exception is stored within the `ThException` object.  This allows calling code to retrieve the root cause of the exception using `getCause()`.  This is exceptionally useful for debugging as it enables tracing the error back to its origin, even if multiple exceptions were thrown along the way. It avoids losing valuable information about the initial problem.
