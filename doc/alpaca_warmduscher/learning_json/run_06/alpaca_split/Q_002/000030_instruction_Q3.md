For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/main.ts' with name 'main.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...
```typescript
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
```
What is the role of `AppModule` in an Angular application, and how does importing it relate to the application's startup process?
