For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/JSONFactory.java' with name 'JSONFactory.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
   @Bean
   public JacksonFactory jacksonFactory() {
       return JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance();
   }
```

What does the `@Bean` annotation signify in the `jacksonFactory()` method, and what is the return value's purpose within the Spring context?
