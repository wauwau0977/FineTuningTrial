The partitioning of the data by `year1`, `doy` (day of year), and `hour_of_day` within the `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method serves a very specific purpose: to analyze heat pump data *within* daily and hourly segments. It enables the calculation of values (first, last, min, max) that represent the range of readings within each day and hour.

Here's a breakdown of the significance:

*   **Year1:** Ensures that the analysis is isolated to a specific year, allowing for year-over-year comparisons or focusing on data from a particular time frame.
*   **Doy (Day of Year):** This groups the data by the day of the year (1-365/366). This is crucial because it removes the influence of the specific calendar date and focuses on the *seasonal* trends within a year. It allows for comparing the same "day" (e.g., the 100th day of the year) across different years.
*   **Hour of Day:**  This groups the data by the hour of the day (0-23). It allows the calculation of minimum, maximum, first and last readings *within each hour*. This is critical for identifying hourly usage patterns.

The combination of these three partitioning keys creates a granular view of the heat pump data, allowing for the following:

*   **Identifying Daily and Hourly Trends:** The window functions calculate values (min, max, first, last) *within* each day and hour. For instance, the `first_value` provides the first measurement taken on a particular day and hour, while the `max` reveals the peak value during that period.
*   **Understanding Daily Range:** By calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum values within each day and hour, the method can reveal how much the heat pump's behavior varied during that period.
*   **Detecting Anomalies:** Sudden changes or deviations from the expected range within a specific day and hour can signal potential issues with the heat pump's operation.

In essence, this partitioning strategy prepares the data for detailed analysis of heat pump behavior *within* specific daily and hourly segments, enabling a deeper understanding of its operational characteristics.
