Declaring `throws Throwable` allows any type of exception or error to propagate from the `before` or `after` methods. This is a broad exception handling strategy.

**Advantages:**

*   **Flexibility:**  The mutex doesn't need to know the specific types of errors that might occur during the hook execution. It handles *any* error.
*   **Simplicity:** It avoids the need to declare multiple exception types in the interface signature.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Lack of Specificity:**  It forces calling code to catch a very broad exception type. This can lead to less precise error handling; you'll likely have to check the type of the caught `Throwable` to determine the appropriate action.
*   **Hidden Errors:** It can mask potential problems if a less critical error is handled as just another `Throwable`.
*   **Difficult Refactoring:** If the internal implementation of hooks changes and specific exceptions become more predictable, refactoring the interface to be more specific becomes a breaking change.

Throwing specific exceptions like `IOException` or `InterruptedException` would provide more clarity and allow for more targeted error handling. However, this would require anticipating all possible exceptions and updating the interface if new exceptions are introduced.  The current design prioritizes flexibility and simplicity at the cost of specific error handling. It's a reasonable choice if the exact types of errors within the hooks are highly unpredictable or variable.
