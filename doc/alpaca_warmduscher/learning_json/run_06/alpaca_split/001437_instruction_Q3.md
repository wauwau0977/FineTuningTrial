For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java' with name 'InfoBean.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "InfoBean{" +
            "deviceName='" + deviceName + '\'' +
            ", buildTimestampServer='" + buildTimestampServer + '\'' +
            ", buildVersionServer='" + buildVersionServer + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```
What is the purpose of overriding the `toString()` method in the `InfoBean` class, and how is the returned string formatted? Explain the benefits of doing so.
