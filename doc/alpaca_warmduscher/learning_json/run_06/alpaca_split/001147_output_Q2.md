Extending `RuntimeException` creates unchecked exceptions, which can lead to certain maintainability and testability issues:

1. **Hidden Errors:**  Because callers aren't *forced* to handle `ThException`, it's easier for errors to go unnoticed during compilation.  A forgotten `try-catch` block won’t be flagged by the compiler, potentially leading to runtime crashes in production.

2. **Reduced Test Coverage:** It's harder to ensure comprehensive test coverage.  You need to actively write tests that specifically trigger and handle these exceptions, as the compiler won’t remind you to do so.

3. **Difficulty Reasoning About Control Flow:** Without explicit exception handling declarations, it can be harder to understand the potential failure points and error paths within the code.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Comprehensive Unit & Integration Tests:** Invest heavily in unit and integration tests that specifically cover scenarios that can throw `ThException`. Focus on boundary conditions and edge cases.

2. **Static Analysis Tools:** Employ static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs) that can detect potential unhandled `ThException` scenarios.

3. **Code Reviews:** Emphasize thorough code reviews to ensure that potential error handling is considered and implemented correctly.

4. **Documentation:** Clearly document the conditions under which `ThException` is thrown and how it should be handled (or not handled) in different parts of the application.

5. **Defensive Programming:** Implement robust input validation and error checks throughout the application to minimize the likelihood of `ThException` being thrown in the first place.  While unchecked exceptions offer convenience,  proactive error prevention is always the best strategy.
