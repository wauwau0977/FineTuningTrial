For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.sass' with name 'about.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed...
```sass
.mat-card
 // margin is kind of repetition from global styles.sass, not sure it needs that
 margin-top: 6px
 margin-bottom: 6px
```
What does the comment "// margin is kind of repetition from global styles.sass, not sure it needs that" indicate about the author's considerations regarding code maintainability and potential styling conflicts?
