You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This SASS file defines the styling for a fixed-position toolbar navigation element within the 'Warmduscher' application. It primarily focuses on the visual presentation of the toolbar, including background color, positioning, spacing, and the appearance of buttons and text within the toolbar.  It's a purely presentational component with no logic.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass`
- **Class Name(s):** `.toolbarNav`, `.toolbarText`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Defines the visual style of a fixed toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This file has no direct user input. It's a styling sheet applied by the application. Output is the visual rendering of the toolbar elements.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The SASS code defines styling rules. The application's rendering engine interprets these rules to apply the visual style to the corresponding HTML elements.
- **External Interactions**: No external interactions.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Not applicable â€“ this is a purely presentational component.  Potential edge cases would relate to the application rendering engine handling invalid SASS syntax (handled by the build process).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on performance. SASS is compiled to CSS, which is then interpreted by the browser. The styling is relatively simple and should not introduce significant rendering delays.
- **Scalability**:  Not applicable.  Styling does not directly impact scalability.
- **Security**: Not applicable.  This is a styling sheet and does not handle any sensitive data.
- **Maintainability**: The code is reasonably readable with clear class names and indentation.  Using SASS variables and mixins could further improve maintainability if the styling becomes more complex.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Not applicable.
- **Usability**: The styling contributes to the overall user experience by providing a visually consistent and accessible toolbar.
- **Compliance**: Adheres to web styling best practices.

## 5. Key Components
- **`.toolbarNav`**: Defines the overall style of the toolbar navigation. Includes background color, position (fixed to the bottom of the screen), z-index, flexbox layout, padding, and a border.
- **`.toolbarText`**: Defines the line height and margin for text elements within the toolbar.
- **Button Styling**: Styles buttons within the toolbar to be flex containers with a column layout and center alignment.
- **Important logic flows**: None, purely styling rules
- **Error handling**: None
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: None.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **SASS Syntax**: The file uses SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) syntax, including nesting and variable definitions.
- **CSS Properties**: Relies on standard CSS properties for styling elements.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None. This file uses core SASS and CSS functionality only.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None. This file doesn't depend on other project modules.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **SASS Variables**: Introduce SASS variables for colors, font sizes, and other frequently used values. This would make it easier to maintain and update the styling.
- **Mixins**:  Create mixins for common styling patterns, such as button styles or flexbox layouts.
- **Responsiveness**: While the current code doesn't explicitly address responsiveness, consider adding media queries to adjust the toolbar's appearance on different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the colors used in the toolbar provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.  Consider ARIA attributes if necessary.
- **Code Readability**: While reasonably readable, longer stylesheets would benefit from more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each style rule.
- **`margin-left: -7px` hack**: The comment indicates this is a hack. Investigate the underlying issue and find a more robust and maintainable solution.  This is likely addressing a visual alignment issue.
