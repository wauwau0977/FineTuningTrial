```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnsafeRunnable {
   void run() throws Exception;
}
```

The `UnsafeRunnable` interface is a single-method functional interface designed to encapsulate a unit of work (a runnable task) that may throw checked exceptions.  Its purpose is to allow a client to define and execute operations where exception handling is deferred to the calling code.

The "unsafe" aspect comes from the `throws Exception` clause in the `run()` method signature.  Typically, functional interfaces used with `Runnable` or similar constructs encourage exception handling *within* the runnable itself, or utilize unchecked exceptions.  By explicitly allowing the throwing of checked exceptions, the interface forces the calling code to acknowledge and handle these exceptions. This shifts the responsibility of exception handling away from the code defining the runnable task itself. This can be considered "unsafe" because it requires explicit handling at the call site and could lead to runtime errors if exception handling is missed.

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to indicate that this interface is intended to be used as a functional interface, i.e., an interface with exactly one abstract method. This annotation is optional, but it enhances code readability and allows the compiler to check that the interface adheres to the functional interface contract.  It enables the use of lambda expressions or method references to create instances of this interface.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where you are processing data from an external source, like a file or a network connection. The processing might involve file I/O or network operations, both of which can throw checked exceptions (`IOException`, `ConnectException`, etc.).  Instead of wrapping the entire processing logic in a `try-catch` block, you could define the processing as an `UnsafeRunnable` and let the caller handle any exceptions that occur during processing.

```java
// Assume some external data source
public class DataSource {
    public void fetchData() throws IOException {
        // Simulate fetching data that could throw an IOException
        if (Math.random() < 0.2) {
            throw new IOException("Network error");
        }
        System.out.println("Data fetched successfully");
    }
}

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataSource dataSource = new DataSource();
        UnsafeRunnable task = () -> dataSource.fetchData(); //Lambda expression

        try {
            task.run();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error fetching data: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` method is wrapped in an `UnsafeRunnable`. The calling code in `main` is then responsible for catching and handling any `Exception` that might be thrown by `fetchData`. This approach allows for more flexible exception handling and separation of concerns.
