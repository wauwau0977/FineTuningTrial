The pipe `| number:'':'de-CH'` is an Angular number formatting pipe that transforms the numeric value of the `boilerStatsByHourNumberOfStaticsRecords` variable before it's displayed. 

Specifically, it does the following:

*   **`number`:** This part specifies that the value should be formatted as a number.
*   **`''` (empty string):** This indicates that no specific minimum or maximum number of digits should be enforced. Angular will handle the formatting automatically based on the size of the number.
*   **`de-CH`:** This is a locale identifier.  `de-CH` represents the German (Switzerland) locale. Applying this locale to the number formatting means that Angular will format the number according to Swiss German conventions. This includes using the appropriate decimal separator (a comma in Swiss German) and thousands separator (a period).

In this context, the pipe is used to ensure that the number of data points for the hourly statistics is displayed in a user-friendly and culturally appropriate format for Swiss German users.  Without the pipe, the number might use a period as a decimal separator, which could be confusing or misinterpreted by users accustomed to Swiss German number formatting conventions.  It enhances readability and usability for the target audience.
