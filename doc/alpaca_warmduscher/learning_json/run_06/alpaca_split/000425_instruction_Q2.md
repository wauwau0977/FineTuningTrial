For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts' with name 'cache.service.spec.ts'... 
Assuming that the `CacheService` class itself has methods like `setData(key: string, data: any)` and `getData(key: string)`, how would you modify the test suite to add a test case that verifies the `setData` and `getData` methods work as expected? Please provide the code snippet for the new test case.
