The `CrudRepository` interface is a core component of Spring Data JPA. It provides a set of pre-defined methods for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a JPA entity. By extending `CrudRepository<MeteoSwissEntity, String>`, the `MeteoSwissRepository` automatically gains methods like `findAll()`, `findById(String id)`, `save(MeteoSwissEntity entity)`, `deleteById(String id)`, and more, without needing to write any implementation code for these common database operations. The first generic parameter (`MeteoSwissEntity`) specifies the entity type this repository manages, while the second (`String`) defines the type of the primary key (in this case, a String). This significantly reduces boilerplate code and streamlines database interactions.
