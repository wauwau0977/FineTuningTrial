Caching the Observable itself, rather than the emitted data, has significant implications. The main benefit is that the network request (or whatever the `loader()` does) is only executed *once* for all subscribers.  This is efficient if the underlying data source is slow or expensive to query.

However, it also means that all subscribers receive the *same* stream of data. If the data changes on the server *after* the first subscriber receives it, subsequent subscribers will also receive the updated data. This is desirable in some cases (e.g., a constantly updating feed), but undesirable in others (e.g., a user's profile information that should not change mid-request).

Caching the *data* instead would mean:

*   The `loader()` is executed on the first request.
*   The emitted data is stored in the cache.
*   Subsequent requests return the cached *data* directly, as a static value or perhaps wrapped in an `of()` Observable.

This approach is beneficial when:

*   The data is relatively static and doesn’t need to be updated in real-time.
*   You want to ensure that each subscriber receives the data as it existed at the time of the request.
*   You want to avoid potential race conditions or inconsistencies that could occur when multiple subscribers are observing the same changing Observable.

However, caching the data requires more complex handling of data transformations and potential invalidation. It also doesn’t provide the benefit of automatically receiving updates from the server.  It's a trade-off between efficiency and data consistency/control.
