For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/BeanUtils.java' with name 'BeanUtils.java'... 
Consider the following snippet:
```java
public void autoWire(Object bean) {
    beanFactory.autowireBean(bean);
}
```
What potential issues might arise if the `bean` object passed to this method is already managed by the Spring container? Explain the behavior you would expect.
