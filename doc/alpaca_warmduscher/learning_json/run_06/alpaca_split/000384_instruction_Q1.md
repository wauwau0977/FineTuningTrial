For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.ts'... 
The component utilizes a reactive form (`myForm`) with several input fields for customizing the data displayed in the chart. The `calculateAutoInterval()` method is triggered on form value changes. What are the potential performance implications of triggering this calculation on *every* form value change, and how could you optimize this behavior to reduce unnecessary computations?
