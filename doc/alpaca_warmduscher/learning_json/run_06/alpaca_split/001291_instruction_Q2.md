For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java'... 
The `doFilter` method currently sets "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*".  What are the security implications of this configuration, and how would you modify the code to allow only specific origins to access the API, for example, `http://example.com` and `http://localhost:3000`? Provide the modified code snippet.
