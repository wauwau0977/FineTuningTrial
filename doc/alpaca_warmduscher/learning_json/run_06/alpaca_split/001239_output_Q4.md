```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.mutex;

public interface Hooks<T> {
   void before(T t) throws Throwable;
   void after(T t) throws Throwable;
}
```

This interface, `Hooks<T>`, defines a mechanism for executing custom logic before and after a protected operation, typically within a mutex or locking context.  

The generic type parameter `T` represents the object or resource being protected by the mutex. This allows the `before` and `after` hooks to interact with, or be aware of, the specific resource being locked/unlocked.

The `before(T t)` method is intended to be executed *immediately before* the critical section or protected operation is entered.  It receives the resource `t` as an argument, allowing for pre-processing or setup before the operation begins.  It declares `throws Throwable` indicating it can handle *any* exception and propagate it, allowing for error handling or cleanup before the protected operation is even attempted.

The `after(T t)` method is designed to be executed *immediately after* the critical section or protected operation has completed.  It also receives the resource `t` as an argument, enabling post-processing, cleanup, or state updates after the operation finishes. Like `before`, it declares `throws Throwable` to allow exception handling or resource release even after the operation itself might have failed.

In the context of a mutex, these hooks provide a way to extend the locking mechanism with additional behavior without modifying the core locking logic. This could include logging, auditing, metrics collection, or performing side effects related to the protected resource. The `throws Throwable` allows for robust error handling and ensures the hooks don't unintentionally swallow exceptions that should be propagated.
