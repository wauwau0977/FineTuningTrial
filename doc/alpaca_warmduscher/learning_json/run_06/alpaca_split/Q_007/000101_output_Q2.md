`routerLinkActive` is a directive in Angular that adds CSS classes to the `<a>` or `<button>` element when the route associated with the `routerLink` is active.  In this case, it adds the `active-link` class. This allows you to style the currently active navigation item (e.g., highlighting it) to provide visual feedback to the user about their current location within the application.  Without `routerLinkActive`, the user would have no clear indication of which menu item corresponds to the currently displayed view, leading to a less intuitive experience.

Potential issues if it wasn't used or incorrectly configured:

*   **Poor User Experience:** Users might click on the same menu item repeatedly, unaware that they are already on the corresponding page.
*   **Accessibility Issues:**  Users relying on keyboard navigation or screen readers might have difficulty identifying the current page.
*   **Styling Conflicts:** If the styling for the `active-link` class isn't defined correctly, it may not visually highlight the current route, negating its purpose.
*   **Incorrect Configuration:** A typo in `active-link` or misconfiguration in the routing module could cause the highlighting to not work as expected. For example if the routes do not match, or there is a conflict with other css classes.
