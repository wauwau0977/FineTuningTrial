Extending `RuntimeException` signifies that `ThException` represents an unchecked exception. This means that methods throwing this exception are not required to declare it in their `throws` clause, offering more flexibility in handling error conditions. It's typically used for conditions that are considered programming errors and are unlikely to be recovered from at runtime.

The constructor `public ThException(String message)` takes a string message as input and passes it to the superclass (RuntimeException) constructor using `super(message)`. This sets the exception's message, which can be retrieved later using the `getMessage()` method.  This message provides valuable context about *why* the exception occurred, aiding in debugging and error handling. It allows a developer to communicate specific details about the issue to the user or logging system.
