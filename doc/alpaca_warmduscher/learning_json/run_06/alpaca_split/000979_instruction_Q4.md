For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' we have the following question: 
Assume this interface is part of a larger system that collects and processes data from multiple sensors. Describe how you might design a data processing pipeline that utilizes this interface. Your explanation should include at least three distinct stages of processing, detailing the input, processing logic, and output of each stage.  Focus on how the data represented by this interface would flow through these stages.
