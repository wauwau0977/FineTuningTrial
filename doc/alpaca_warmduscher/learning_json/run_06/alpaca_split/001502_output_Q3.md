The purpose of these assertions is to verify that the `getSignedNumber` method correctly handles integer values that, when interpreted as unsigned 16-bit integers, fall within the range of negative numbers when interpreted as signed 16-bit integers. Specifically, it tests that values above 32767 (2^15 - 1) are correctly converted to their negative counterparts.

The tests suggest that the `getSignedNumber` method likely implements a two's complement conversion. This is a common way to represent signed integers in computers.  If a value greater than 32767 is passed to the method, it probably subtracts 65536 (2^16) from the input value to obtain the corresponding negative representation.  

For example:
- `HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(65535)` would calculate 65535 - 65536 = -1
- `HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(65534)` would calculate 65534 - 65536 = -2

This approach effectively allows the method to interpret values in the range 0-65535 as both unsigned and signed 16-bit integers, depending on the context.  This is particularly common when reading data from Modbus devices, where registers often hold 16-bit values that can be interpreted in different ways.
