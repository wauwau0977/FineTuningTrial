For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts' we have the following question: 
Summarize the purpose and functionality of the `beforeEach` block that executes *before* each test case (`it` block).  Specifically, detail what happens within the `async` `beforeEach` and the subsequent synchronous `beforeEach`. Explain what `TestBed.configureTestingModule` does, what `compileComponents()` achieves, and the roles of `createComponent` and `detectChanges`.
