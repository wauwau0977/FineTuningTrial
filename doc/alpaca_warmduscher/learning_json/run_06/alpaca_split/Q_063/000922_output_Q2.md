The limited representation in `toString()` has several implications:

*   **Incomplete Debugging Information:** When logging or debugging, developers might not have access to all relevant information needed to diagnose issues.  For example, if an error occurs and only the `toString()` output is available, it would be difficult to determine the `clientVersion`, `httpStatus`, or `exception` associated with the request.
*   **Difficulty in Root Cause Analysis:**  Without complete data, it becomes harder to trace the origin of problems or identify patterns in failed requests.
*   **Reduced Log Readability:** While a concise log message can be helpful, omitting key information can make it difficult to understand the context of the request.

When deciding which fields to include in a `toString()` method, I would consider:

*   **Relevance for Debugging:** Focus on fields that are most likely to be useful in identifying and resolving issues.
*   **Critical Information:** Include fields that are essential for understanding the state of the object.
*   **Conciseness:** Avoid including unnecessary or redundant information that would clutter the output.
*   **Sensitivity:** Exclude any sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal identifiable information) that should not be logged.
*   **Impact on Performance:**  Avoid very large or complex fields that could significantly impact the performance of the `toString()` method.

A good practice is to include the most important fields, and potentially add a mechanism to output all fields if a more detailed representation is needed (e.g., using a separate debugging method).
