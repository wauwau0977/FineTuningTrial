The `::ng-deep` selector is a deprecated (and soon to be removed) way to pierce the shadow DOM encapsulation of Angular components.  It allows the styles defined within the `about.component.sass` file to apply to elements *inside* the shadow DOM of any component that uses a `.mat-card-header-text` element. Without `::ng-deep`, styles would typically be scoped to the current component and wouldn't affect elements within another component's shadow DOM.

In this specific case, `margin-left: -15px` is applied to the `.myInfoTitle` element, presumably to adjust its horizontal positioning within the `.mat-card-header-text`.  The negative margin is likely used to fine-tune the alignment, potentially pulling it slightly to the left.  Without `::ng-deep`, this styling might not propagate if `.myInfoTitle` resides inside a component with shadow DOM encapsulation. It's important to note that using `::ng-deep` is discouraged in favor of more modern techniques like CSS variables and component inputs for better encapsulation and maintainability.
