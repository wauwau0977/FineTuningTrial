```java
@Override
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
    HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;

    // Adds the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header to the response, allowing requests from any origin (*).
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");

    // Adds the "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" header to the response, indicating whether or not the server accepts cookies sent from cross-origin requests.  "true" enables credential sharing.
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");

    // Adds the "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" header to the response, specifying which headers are allowed in cross-origin requests.  "Content-Type, *, X-Requested-With" allows these specific headers, broadening compatibility. The inclusion of '*' generally allows all headers, though specifying them explicitly is best practice for security and clarity. Including 'X-Requested-With' is crucial for compatibility with older AJAX libraries.
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, *, X-Requested-With");

    // Adds the "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" header to the response, specifying which HTTP methods are allowed in cross-origin requests.  "GET, POST, OPTIONS" allows these methods.
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, OPTIONS");

    // Passes the request and response on to the next filter in the chain. This is essential for the request to proceed to the intended resource. Without this line, the request would be terminated here.
    chain.doFilter(request, response);
}
