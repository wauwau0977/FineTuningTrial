For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.html' with name 'app.component.html' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```html
<router-outlet class="myContent"></router-outlet>
<div class="myLastSpace"></div>
```
What is the purpose of the `<router-outlet>` and the `<div>` with class `myLastSpace` in this section of the code? How do they contribute to the overall layout of the application?
