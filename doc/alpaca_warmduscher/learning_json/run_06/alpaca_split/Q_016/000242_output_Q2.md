I would place logging statements at the beginning and end of the `intercept` method, and also before setting each header. This allows me to track the original request and the modified request. I'd log the URL of the request, the original headers, the added headers and their values, and a timestamp.

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";
import {HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest} from "@angular/common/http";
import {Observable} from "rxjs";
import {ClientIdService} from "./client-id.service";
import {HeatingDataService} from "./heating-data.service";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";

@Injectable()
export class MyHttpInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  constructor(private clientIdService: ClientIdService) {
  }

  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log(`[Interceptor] Incoming request: ${req.url}`);
    console.log(`[Interceptor] Original headers:`, req.headers);

    let clientId: string;
    this.clientIdService.getClientId().subscribe(id => {
        clientId = id;
    });
    let clientVersion = environment.buildTimestampClient;

    const modifiedReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers
        .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID, clientId)
        .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION, clientVersion)
    });

    console.log(`[Interceptor] Modified headers:`, modifiedReq.headers);
    console.log(`[Interceptor] Sending request: ${modifiedReq.url}`);

    return next.handle(modifiedReq);
  }
}
```

This provides sufficient information for debugging and understanding how the interceptor is affecting the requests.  I'd also consider using a proper logging library that supports different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) to control the amount of logging output.  The logging level could be configurable through environment variables.
