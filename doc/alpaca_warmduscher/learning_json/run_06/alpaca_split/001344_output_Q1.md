The `sessionDeviceRepository.findById(sessionId).ifPresentOrElse(...)` check is designed to prevent duplicate entries for the same `sessionId` in the database. If a `SessionDevice` with the given `sessionId` already exists, the `device` variable will be populated, and the code will simply log a debug message. If no existing record is found, the code proceeds to create and save a new `SessionDevice`.

In a highly concurrent environment, a race condition could occur. Multiple threads could simultaneously call `findById(sessionId)` and both find that no record exists. They could then *both* attempt to create and save new `SessionDevice` records with the same `sessionId`, resulting in a database constraint violation (e.g., a unique constraint on `sessionId`).

**Addressing the concurrency issue:**

Several approaches can be used:

1.  **Database-Level Unique Constraint:** Ensure a unique constraint is defined on the `sessionId` column in the database table. This will prevent duplicate records from being inserted, and the application will receive an exception. The application needs to handle this exception gracefully (e.g., by logging it or retrying the operation).  This is the most reliable solution.

2.  **Synchronized Block:**  Wrap the `findById` and `save` operations in a synchronized block using a suitable lock. This ensures that only one thread can access these operations at a time. This can introduce performance overhead, but guarantees correctness.

3.  **Optimistic Locking:** Add a version or timestamp column to the `SessionDevice` entity. Read the version/timestamp before reading the record. When updating, include the original version/timestamp in the `WHERE` clause. If the version/timestamp doesn't match, the update fails, indicating a concurrent modification.

4.  **Database Transaction with Isolation Level:** Use a database transaction with an appropriate isolation level (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE` or `REPEATABLE READ`). This prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.

In this specific case, the **database-level unique constraint** is the most appropriate solution, as it guarantees data integrity regardless of application code errors or concurrency issues. The application should handle the resulting exception gracefully.
