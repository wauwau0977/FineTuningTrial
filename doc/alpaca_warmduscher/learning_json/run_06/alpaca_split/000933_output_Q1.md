Defining these methods as interface methods enforces a contract on any class that *implements* this interface.  Any implementing class *must* provide concrete implementations for `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()`, `getDayOfWeekText()`, `getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()`, `getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`, and `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`. This guarantees that the implementing class will provide access to these specific pieces of data in a consistent manner.  The benefit is enhanced flexibility and testability.  We can easily switch between different implementations of `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` without affecting the code that *uses* the interface, promoting loose coupling and easier unit testing (mocking interfaces is much easier than mocking concrete classes). It also provides a clear, well-defined API for accessing the data represented by this entity.
