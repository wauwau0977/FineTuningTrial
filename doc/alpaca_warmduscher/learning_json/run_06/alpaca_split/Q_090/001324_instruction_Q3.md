For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MvcConfig.java' with name 'MvcConfig.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
   private final SessionRequestRepository sessionRequestRepository;
   public MvcConfig(SessionRequestRepository sessionRequestRepository) {
       super();
       this.sessionRequestRepository = sessionRequestRepository;
   }
```
What is the purpose of these lines, and how does dependency injection play a role here?
