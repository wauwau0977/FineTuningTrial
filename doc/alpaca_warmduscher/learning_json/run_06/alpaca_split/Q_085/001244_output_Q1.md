Throwing `Throwable` is generally discouraged in production code due to its broad scope. While it catches *everything*, it obscures the types of errors that can actually occur within `operateGlobalSynced`. This makes error handling less precise and can mask potential bugs. A client catching `Throwable` has to deal with everything from IOExceptions to OutOfMemoryErrors, which might not be relevant to the intended behavior.  

However, a benefit in this *specific* scenario might be related to the intention of ensuring *any* unhandled exception within the synchronized block doesn't lead to a silent failure. It's a heavy-handed way to guarantee the caller is informed of *any* issue during the operation, even unexpected ones.  A better approach would usually be to define specific, relevant exceptions that the operation might throw (e.g., a custom `MutexOperationException`) and only declare those in the method signature. If truly needing to catch all exceptions within the operation itself, then catch them internally, log them, and potentially re-throw a more specific, application-defined exception.
