For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
static <R> R execute(Callable<R> c) {
    if (c == null) {
        return null;
    }
    try {
        return c.call();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```

What is the role of the `Callable` interface in this method, and how does the exception handling mechanism compare to the `execute` method that accepts a `Function`?
