You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This TypeScript file (`polyfills.ts`) provides necessary polyfills for Angular applications to ensure compatibility with a wider range of browsers. It primarily focuses on providing compatibility for older browsers that may not fully support modern web standards. The file is divided into sections for browser polyfills (applied before Zone.js loading) and application-specific imports (loaded after Zone.js). It also provides instructions on how to customize Zone.js behavior via flags.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/polyfills.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** None. This file is a module containing imports and configuration, not class definitions.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Provide browser compatibility by importing polyfills. Configure Zone.js behavior.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This file does not directly handle user input or produce direct outputs. It's a configuration and compatibility layer. The "input" is the target browser environment, and the "output" is an Angular application that functions correctly in that environment.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Imports `zone.js` to enable Angular's change detection and event handling.
    2. Offers guidance on disabling specific Zone.js patches for performance or compatibility reasons.  This involves creating a `zone-flags.ts` file and setting flags.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Imports the `zone.js` library.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - The file provides instructions for disabling specific Zone.js features, allowing developers to address compatibility issues or improve performance in specific browsers.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimizing the impact of polyfills on application startup and runtime performance is crucial. The file guides developers on selectively disabling Zone.js patches when possible.
- **Maintainability**: The file is relatively simple and well-commented, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The purpose of the file is to enhance the reliability and availability of the Angular application by ensuring it runs correctly in a wider range of browsers.
- **Usability**: The file provides clear instructions on how to customize Zone.js behavior, making it easy for developers to adapt the polyfills to their specific needs.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**: None. This file is a module with imports and configurations.
- **Important Logic Flows**: The primary logic is the order of imports and the configuration options for Zone.js.
- **Error Handling**: The file does not contain explicit error handling.
- **Classes**: None
- **Modules**: This file acts as a module to configure and provide polyfills for the Angular application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript**: Used for the file's syntax and type checking.
- **ES Modules**: Imports are used to include necessary libraries and polyfills.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **zone.js**:  A core library for Angular that provides change detection, event handling, and other essential features.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Automated Polyfill Inclusion**: Explore using tools like `babel-polyfill` or `core-js` to automatically include only the necessary polyfills based on the target browser environment. This could reduce the application's bundle size and improve performance.
- **Conditional Polyfill Loading**: Implement a mechanism to load polyfills only when they are needed, based on browser detection.
- **Documentation Enhancement**:  Provide more detailed explanations of the Zone.js flags and their potential impact on performance and compatibility.  Include a table detailing which flags apply to which browsers.
