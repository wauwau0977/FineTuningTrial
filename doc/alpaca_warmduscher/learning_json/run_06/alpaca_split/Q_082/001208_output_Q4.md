The `getMedian` method calculates the median of values extracted from a collection of objects of type `T`. It receives a collection `entries`, a `ToDoubleFunction` (`valueSupplier`) to extract a double value from each object, and an optional `limit` parameter.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1.  **Input Validation:** It first asserts that both the `entries` collection and the `valueSupplier` function are not null.

2.  **Limit Handling:** The `limit` parameter controls the maximum number of elements considered for the median calculation.  If `limit` is negative, it's set to 0. This effectively means that all entries will be considered if the limit is negative.

3.  **Data Selection:** The method calculates the `samples` variable, which determines how many elements to use from the input collection. If `limit` is greater than 0 and the collection size is greater than or equal to the `limit`, then `samples` will be set to the `limit`. Otherwise, `samples` will be the collection size. This ensures that the method does not try to access elements beyond the collection's bounds.

4.  **Data Extraction and Storage:** It creates a `double` array `values` of size `samples`. It iterates through the `entries` collection, applying the `valueSupplier` to each element to extract its corresponding double value. To implement the limit, the code skips the first `entries.size() - samples` elements. It then populates the `values` array with the extracted double values.

5.  **Median Calculation:** Finally, it creates an instance of the `Median` class from the Apache Commons Math library and calls its `evaluate` method with the `values` array to calculate the median.  The calculated median is then returned as a `double`.
