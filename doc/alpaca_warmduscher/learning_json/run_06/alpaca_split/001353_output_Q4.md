```java
public static boolean isSessionRelevantRequest(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String path = request.getRequestURI();
    return path != null
            && Stream.of("html", "htm", "css", "png", "svg", "woff", "woff2", "json", "js").noneMatch(s -> StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(path, s))
            && !StringUtils.equals("/", path)
            && !StringUtils.equals("/pi11", path)
            && !StringUtils.equals("/pi11/", path)
            && !StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase(request.getMethod(), HttpMethod.OPTIONS.name()) // ignore preflight requests
            ;
}
```

The `isSessionRelevantRequest` method determines whether a given HTTP request should be tracked by creating or updating a session record.  Its purpose is to avoid unnecessary session tracking for requests that are likely to be static assets or health checks, reducing database load and improving performance.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1.  **`path != null`**:  Checks if the request URI is not null. This is a basic safety check to prevent NullPointerExceptions.

2.  **`Stream.of("html", "htm", "css", "png", "svg", "woff", "woff2", "json", "js").noneMatch(s -> StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(path, s))`**: This is the core filtering logic. It creates a stream of common file extensions for static web assets (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, JavaScript, JSON).  The `noneMatch` method checks if the request URI *does not* end with any of these extensions. If the path ends with one of these extensions, the method returns `false` (meaning the request is *not* relevant for session tracking).  This effectively excludes requests for static assets.

3.  **`!StringUtils.equals("/", path)`**:  This condition excludes requests to the root path ("/"). Typically, root path requests might be handled by a front-end router, and tracking them individually wouldn't provide meaningful session data.

4.  **`!StringUtils.equals("/pi11", path)` and `!StringUtils.equals("/pi11/", path)`**: These conditions exclude requests to the `/pi11` and `/pi11/` paths. These paths are likely specific to the application (perhaps a health check or monitoring endpoint) and don't need to be associated with a session.

5.  **`!StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase(request.getMethod(), HttpMethod.OPTIONS.name())`**: This condition excludes HTTP OPTIONS requests. OPTIONS requests are part of the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight mechanism. Tracking these preflight requests would add unnecessary overhead, as they are simply checks by the browser to determine if a cross-origin request is allowed.

The method returns `true` only if *all* of these conditions are met, indicating that the request is considered relevant for session tracking. The exclusion of static assets, root paths, specific endpoints, and OPTIONS requests are all aimed at optimizing the session tracking process and reducing unnecessary database operations.
