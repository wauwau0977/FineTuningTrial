To expose the startup time via a health endpoint, I’d integrate this class with Spring Boot’s `HealthIndicator` interface. Here’s how I'd extend it:

1.  **Implement `HealthIndicator`:** Create a new class (e.g., `StartupHealthIndicator`) that implements the `HealthIndicator` interface.
2.  **Dependency Injection:**  Inject an instance of `StartupData` into the `StartupHealthIndicator` class using constructor injection.
3.  **Implement `health()`:** Within the `health()` method of the indicator, retrieve the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` from the `StartupData` instance. Construct a `Health` object with the startup time as a detail. (e.g., `Health health = Health.status("UP").details(Collections.singletonMap("startupTime", startupData.getStartupTimeTakenInMillis())).build();`)
4.  **Register the Indicator:** Spring Boot automatically discovers and registers `HealthIndicator` implementations. No explicit configuration is usually needed.

This allows you to access the startup time by hitting the `/actuator/health` endpoint (assuming Spring Boot Actuator is enabled), and it will be included in the JSON response as a detail.  The `/actuator/health` endpoint will then expose the startup time as a metric.
