These indexes are designed to speed up queries that filter or sort data based on the indexed columns. Let's break down each one:

*   `@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_1", columnList = "requestDate")`:  This index on `requestDate` suggests that queries frequently filter or sort by the time a session request was made. Common use cases would be retrieving requests within a specific date range (e.g., "give me all requests from the last hour") or finding the oldest/newest requests.  Without this index, the database would have to scan the entire table to find matching requests.

*   `@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_2", columnList = "clientId")`: This index on `clientId` implies that queries often filter requests by the client that made them. Use cases include "find all requests from client X" or grouping requests by client to analyze client behavior.  This is particularly helpful if there are many requests and a relatively small number of clients.

*   `@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_3", columnList = "sessionId")`: This index on `sessionId` suggests that queries often need to retrieve all requests associated with a specific session. This is crucial for debugging or tracing the flow of a user's session.  This index enables efficient lookup of requests within a particular session.

In general, indexes allow the database to locate specific rows more quickly by using a data structure (like a B-tree) that provides a sorted lookup.  Without indexes, the database must perform a full table scan, which is much slower, especially for large tables.
