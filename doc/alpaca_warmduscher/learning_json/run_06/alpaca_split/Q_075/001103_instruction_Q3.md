For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/BeanUtils.java' with name 'BeanUtils.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
private final AutowireCapableBeanFactory beanFactory;
public BeanUtils(AutowireCapableBeanFactory beanFactory) {
    this.beanFactory = beanFactory;
}
```
What is the purpose of holding an instance of `AutowireCapableBeanFactory` and initializing it through the constructor? How does this contribute to the functionality of the `BeanUtils` class?
