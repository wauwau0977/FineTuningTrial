The `fxLayout` directives are part of Angular Flex-Layout, a powerful module for creating responsive layouts. In this code snippet, they control how the date and time input fields are arranged within their container.

*   **`fxLayout.xs="column"`:** On extra-small screens (xs) – typically mobile devices – the elements within the container are arranged in a single column, stacking vertically.
*   **`fxLayout.gt-xs="row"`:** On screens greater than extra-small (gt-xs) – tablets, desktops, etc. – the elements are arranged in a row, horizontally.
*   **`fxFill`:** This directive instructs the container to expand and fill the available space. It makes the container take up the full width of its parent.

Essentially, the layout is responsive. On mobile devices, the "von" (from) date, "Zeit (Stunde)" (time - hour), and the equivalent "bis" (to) fields are stacked vertically for easier viewing. As the screen size increases, the layout switches to a horizontal row, placing the fields side-by-side. The `fxFill` directive ensures that the container adapts to the available space, providing a clean and consistent layout across different screen sizes.  The `div` with `style="width: 1em"` likely adds some spacing between the fields on larger screens.
