Implementing `getData()` requires careful consideration of how to handle potentially large datasets efficiently and provide clients with the data they need. Here’s how I’d approach pagination, filtering, and sorting:

1. **Pagination:**  Returning the entire dataset at once could be inefficient and lead to performance issues. I would implement pagination using parameters like `pageNumber` and `pageSize`. The `getData()` method signature could evolve to: `List<MeteoSwissEntity> getData(int pageNumber, int pageSize)`.  The implementation would involve querying the data source with appropriate `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses (for SQL databases) or equivalent mechanisms for other data sources (e.g., API pagination parameters).  The method could also return the total number of records to enable clients to build proper pagination controls.

2. **Filtering:** Clients might only need a subset of the data based on specific criteria (e.g., temperature range, location, time period).  I would support filtering through parameters passed to `getData()`. This could be implemented using a flexible approach:
    *   **Criteria Objects:** Define a `Criteria` object with fields corresponding to the filterable attributes of `MeteoSwissEntity`.
    *   **Map<String, Object>:** A simple `Map` could be used, where keys are the field names and values are the filter values.
    *   The implementation would dynamically build the query based on the provided filter criteria. For example, if the client provides a filter for `temperature > 20`, the query would include a `WHERE temperature > 20` clause.

3. **Sorting:** Clients might want to order the data based on one or more fields.  I would support sorting by allowing clients to specify the sorting field(s) and direction (ascending or descending) as parameters to `getData()`. The implementation would include an `ORDER BY` clause in the query, incorporating the specified fields and direction.

4. **Combined Approach:** The `getData()` method signature could become: `List<MeteoSwissEntity> getData(int pageNumber, int pageSize, Map<String, Object> filters, List<SortOrder> sortOrders)`.  `SortOrder` would be a custom class or enum defining the field to sort by and the direction (ascending/descending).

5. **Performance:**  Efficient database indexing is crucial for filtering and sorting performance. Ensure that the fields used for filtering and sorting are properly indexed.  Avoid full table scans whenever possible.
