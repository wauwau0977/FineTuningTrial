Using `java.util.Random` for security-sensitive applications is problematic. `java.util.Random` is a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that's not cryptographically secure. Its seed is based on the current system time, which is predictable.  An attacker could potentially predict the generated random numbers, especially if they have some knowledge of the system's state.  This could lead to vulnerabilities if these random bytes are used for things like generating keys, nonces, or other security-critical values.

Mitigation:

1.  **Use `java.security.SecureRandom`:** Replace `new Random()` with `java.security.SecureRandom`. `SecureRandom` uses a cryptographically strong random number generator, making it much more difficult for an attacker to predict the generated numbers.

    ```java
    java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
    secureRandom.nextBytes(randomBytes);
    ```
2.  **Seed SecureRandom Properly:** When creating a `SecureRandom` instance, consider explicitly seeding it with a strong source of entropy if necessary. This ensures that the initial seed is truly random.
3.  **Consider a Hardware Random Number Generator (HRNG):** For applications requiring the highest level of security, consider using a hardware random number generator (HRNG), which relies on physical phenomena to generate truly random numbers.
4.  **Avoid Re-seeding in a Predictable Way:** If re-seeding `SecureRandom`, ensure the seed is obtained from a reliable and unpredictable source.
