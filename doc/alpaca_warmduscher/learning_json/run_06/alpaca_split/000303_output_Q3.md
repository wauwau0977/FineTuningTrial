These styles work together to create a vertically-centered and responsive video display. Letâ€™s break it down:

*   **.video-holder**: This acts as a container for the video.
    *   `display: flex`:  Enables flexbox layout, allowing for easy arrangement of child elements.
    *   `flex-direction: column`:  Arranges the child elements vertically (one below the other).
    *   `align-items: center`: Horizontally centers the child element (in this case, the `.video`) within the container.

*   **.video**: This styles the video element itself.
    *   `height: 50vh`: Sets the video's height to 50% of the viewport height. This ensures the video takes up a significant portion of the screen, but remains proportional to the viewport size for responsiveness.
    *   `object-fit: scale-down`: This is crucial for responsiveness. It ensures the video scales down to fit within the specified height (50vh) *without* distorting its aspect ratio. If the video's original dimensions are wider than the viewport, it will be scaled down proportionally to fit.
    *   `margin-bottom: 25px`: Adds 25 pixels of margin below the video, creating some space between the video and any content that follows it.

Combined, these styles create a layout where the video is vertically centered within its container, scales down responsively to fit the viewport height while maintaining its aspect ratio, and has a bottom margin for visual separation. The flexbox layout on the container provides flexibility for potentially adding more elements around the video in the future.
