`dtS` is calculated as the difference between the current time (in milliseconds) and `t0`, divided by 1000. `t0` is initialized as `System.currentTimeMillis() - 1` in the class constructor. Therefore, `dtS` represents the time elapsed since just before the class was instantiated, in seconds.

Potential issues with using `System.currentTimeMillis()` in this way over a long runtime stem from its susceptibility to clock drift and potential adjustments (e.g., NTP synchronization). If the system clock is adjusted backward, `dtS` could become negative or significantly smaller, leading to incorrect data values. Furthermore, even without clock adjustments, slight drift can accumulate over time, causing inaccuracies. This approach is fine for testing or short-lived applications, but not suitable for production scenarios requiring precise time measurements or consistent data generation. A better approach in production might involve using a monotonic clock like `System.nanoTime()` or leveraging a dedicated time service.
