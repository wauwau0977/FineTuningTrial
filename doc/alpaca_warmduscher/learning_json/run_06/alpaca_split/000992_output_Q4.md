```java
public AuditLogEntity(String scope1, String scope2, String scope3, String message, String detail, String exception) {
    this.scope1 = scope1;
    this.scope2 = scope2;
    this.scope3 = scope3;
    this.message = message;
    this.detail = detail;
    this.exception = exception;
}
```
This constructor serves to initialize an `AuditLogEntity` object with detailed information about an event that needs to be logged. It takes six string arguments representing different aspects of the log entry: `scope1`, `scope2`, `scope3`, `message`, `detail`, and `exception`. It assigns the provided values to the corresponding instance variables of the `AuditLogEntity` object.

In contrast to the default constructor `AuditLogEntity()`, which creates an object with default values (null for strings, current date for createDate, and a generated UUID for id), this constructor allows the caller to specify the details of the audit log entry at the time of object creation. The default constructor is useful for creating an empty log entry that can be populated later, while this constructor is useful when all the log details are known upfront. The `id` and `createDate` are initialized by default in any case, and not in this constructor.
