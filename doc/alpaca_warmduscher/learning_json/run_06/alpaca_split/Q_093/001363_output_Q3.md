The `@PostMapping` annotation indicates that this method handles HTTP POST requests. Specifically, it maps POST requests to the `/dialalogflow/heating` endpoint.  

The `produces = {MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE}` part of the annotation specifies that the method will return a response with the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.  This tells the client (in this case, Dialogflow) that the response body will be formatted as JSON. It essentially indicates that the method is producing JSON as its output.
