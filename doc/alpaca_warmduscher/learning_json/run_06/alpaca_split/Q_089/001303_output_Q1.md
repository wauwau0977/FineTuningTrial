The `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` is responsible for registering date and time formatters with the `FormattingConversionService`. This service is a central component for converting between strings and objects, crucial for handling data from user input (e.g., forms) and preparing data for output (e.g., JSON responses). The registrar specifically registers the `dateFormat` and `dateTimeFormat` instances, telling the conversion service *how* to parse and format `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects.

Without the registrar, the `FormattingConversionService` wouldnâ€™t know how to handle these types. Specifically, Spring would likely fail to convert strings representing dates/times into `LocalDate` or `LocalDateTime` objects during request processing (e.g., when binding form data to controller methods) and vice-versa.  This would result in exceptions, typically `IllegalStateException` or similar conversion errors.  The application would effectively be unable to handle date and time values provided as strings.
