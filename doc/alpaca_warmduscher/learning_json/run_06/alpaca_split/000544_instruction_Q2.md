For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.ts'... 
The `gaugeChartOptions` object defines the configuration for the Highcharts gauge. Looking specifically at the `yAxis` configuration, what is the purpose of `minorTickInterval: 'auto'`, `minorTickWidth: 1`, and how do these properties contribute to the visual representation of the gauge? Explain how the `plotBands` array affects the gauge's appearance.
