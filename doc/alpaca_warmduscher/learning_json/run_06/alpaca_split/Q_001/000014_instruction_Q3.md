For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/index.html' with name 'index.html' where below a part of it is displayed...
```html
<body class="mat-typography mat-app-background" style="">
<app-root></app-root>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to continue using this application.</noscript>
</body>
```
What is the purpose of the `app-root` element and the `noscript` tag within the `body` of the HTML? How do they contribute to the applicationâ€™s functionality?
