To create multiple caches with different names and configurations, you can leverage the `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` constructor which accepts a `Map` of cache names and their corresponding configurations. Here’s how you’d modify the `cacheManager()` method:

```java
   @Bean
   public CacheManager cacheManager() {
       Map<String, CacheProperties> cacheConfigurations = new HashMap<>();
       cacheConfigurations.put("sessionDeviceCache", new CacheProperties()); // Default properties
       cacheConfigurations.put("userPreferencesCache", new CacheProperties().timeToLive(3600)); // Example with a TTL of 1 hour
       cacheConfigurations.put("deviceDataCache", new CacheProperties().maxCapacity(1000)); // Example with max capacity

       return new ConcurrentMapCacheManager(cacheConfigurations);
   }
```

Where `CacheProperties` is a class that holds the desired cache configuration (e.g., time-to-live, maximum capacity, eviction policies).  You'd need to define such a class.  A basic example:

```java
class CacheProperties {
    private long timeToLive = -1; // -1 means no expiration
    private int maxCapacity = -1; // -1 means no limit

    public long getTimeToLive() {
        return timeToLive;
    }

    public CacheProperties timeToLive(long timeToLive) {
        this.timeToLive = timeToLive;
        return this;
    }

    public int getMaxCapacity() {
        return maxCapacity;
    }

    public CacheProperties maxCapacity(int maxCapacity) {
        this.maxCapacity = maxCapacity;
        return this;
    }
}
```

**Scenarios necessitating multiple caches:**

*   **Data Isolation:** Separate caches for different types of data (e.g., user session data, device telemetry, application settings) to avoid conflicts and improve performance.
*   **Different Expiration Policies:**  Different data may require different time-to-live (TTL) values.  For example, user session data might have a short TTL, while application settings might have a longer TTL.
*   **Different Eviction Strategies:** Some caches might benefit from Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction, while others might use a different strategy.
*   **Scalability & Performance:**  Isolating data into different caches can improve concurrency and reduce contention.  If one cache becomes a bottleneck, it won't affect other caches.
