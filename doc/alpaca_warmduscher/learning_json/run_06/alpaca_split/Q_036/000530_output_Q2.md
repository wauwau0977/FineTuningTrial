Property binding is used because it allows the Angular component to *control* the values of HTML attributes and component properties dynamically. Specifically:

*   **One-way Data Flow:** Property binding establishes a one-way data flow *from* the Angular component’s TypeScript class *to* the HTML template. The `highcharts` and `gaugeChartOptions` variables in the component are the “source of truth,” and their values are projected onto the corresponding attributes of the `<highcharts-chart>` component.

*   **JavaScript Object/Reference:** Both `Highcharts` and `gaugeChartOptions` represent JavaScript objects or references to objects (in the case of `Highcharts`). Interpolation (`{{ ... }}`) is designed for string-based values.  You can't directly "interpolate" a JavaScript object or a reference to an object. Angular needs a way to *assign* the object/reference, and property binding facilitates this.

*   **Component Interaction:** This allows the Angular component to completely manage the state and configuration of the Highcharts chart. The chart’s behavior is driven by the component’s data and logic.  Event binding is for handling user interactions with the chart; it’s not relevant to *setting up* the chart initially.
