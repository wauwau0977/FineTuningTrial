In this context, "evergreen" browsers are defined as those that automatically update to the latest versions. This typically includes the most recent versions of Safari, Chrome (including Opera), Edge, iOS Chrome and other modern browsers. The implication is that these browsers already have support for most modern web features, reducing the need for extensive polyfilling.

The approach of targeting evergreen browsers is taken to reduce the overall bundle size and complexity of the application.  Polyfills add weight to the application, slowing down initial load times. By focusing on modern browsers, the developers can avoid including polyfills for features already natively supported, creating a leaner and faster application.

The primary trade-off is reduced browser support. By *not* supporting older browsers, the application will not be usable by users on those platforms. This is an acceptable trade-off in many cases, as the number of users on older browsers is often relatively small, and the benefits of a faster, more modern application outweigh the cost of excluding them.  However, this decision needs to be made based on the target audience and the specific requirements of the project.
