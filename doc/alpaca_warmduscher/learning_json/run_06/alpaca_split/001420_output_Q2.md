The `@ResponseBody` annotation tells Spring that the return value of the method should be directly written to the response body of the HTTP request. It essentially skips the view resolution process, meaning Spring doesn't look for a view template to render the data.  Instead, it serializes the return value (in this case, `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo` objects) into a suitable format (typically JSON or XML, based on the `Content-Type` header and configured message converters).

Implications for the data being returned:

*   **Serialization:** The objects must be serializable, meaning there must be a mechanism to convert them into a string representation. Spring uses message converters (like Jackson for JSON) to handle this.
*   **Data Exposure:** The data contained within `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo` will be directly exposed in the response.  Care must be taken to avoid exposing sensitive information.

Other annotations for controlling the response format and status code:

*   **`@RequestBody`:** Used to bind the request body to a method parameter.
*   **`@RequestMapping(produces = "application/json")` or `@Produces("application/json")`:** Explicitly specifies the content type of the response. This is often implicit with `@ResponseBody`, but it's good practice to be explicit.
*   **`@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)` or `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)`:**  Allows you to set the HTTP status code for the response. For example, you might use `HttpStatus.CREATED` for a successful POST request.
*   **`@RestController`:** This annotation is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It automatically marks all methods in the controller as returning a response body.
*   **`@JsonView(value = {SomeView.class})`**: Used in combination with Jackson, allows to specify a subset of the fields to be serialized in JSON.
