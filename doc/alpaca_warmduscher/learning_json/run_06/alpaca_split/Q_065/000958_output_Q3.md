The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation is a Jackson annotation used to control the order in which the properties of a Java object (in this case, an interface) are serialized into JSON.  Without this annotation, Jackson typically serializes properties in the order they appear in the Java source code or based on getter method names.  

Here, `@JsonPropertyOrder({"hourOfTheDay", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", "numOfStatisticRecords1"})` explicitly specifies that when an object implementing `BoilerStatsByHour` is converted to JSON, the properties should appear in that exact order in the resulting JSON string.  This is useful for maintaining a consistent JSON structure, which can be important for clients that rely on a specific property order for parsing or processing.  It enhances readability and can simplify client-side code.
