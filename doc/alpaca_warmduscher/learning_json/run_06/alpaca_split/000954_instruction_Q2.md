For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByHour.java'... 
Considering this interface, what potential issues might arise if a concrete implementation were to also include methods for `getMaxBoilerTemp()`, `getMinBoilerTemp()`, and `getAvgBoilerTemp()`? Specifically, how might this impact consumers of this interface and any existing code utilizing it? Discuss potential solutions to mitigate these issues.
