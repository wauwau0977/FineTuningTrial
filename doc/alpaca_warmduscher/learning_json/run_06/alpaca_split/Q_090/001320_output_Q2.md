The `@Configuration` annotation marks the class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring container. It essentially tells Spring that this class provides the configuration for various components within the application. The `@Component` annotation marks the class as an auto-detectable component. Spring's component scanning will automatically discover and register instances of this class as beans.

The combination of `@Configuration` and `@Component` *can* lead to potential issues, specifically if `@EnableWebMvc` is also present. `@EnableWebMvc` brings in the default `WebMvcConfigurer` implementation, potentially overriding settings configured in the `MvcConfig` class. Spring Boot's auto-configuration is designed to handle web configuration. If you explicitly enable web MVC via `@EnableWebMvc`, you're taking control away from Spring Boot's sensible defaults and could inadvertently break application properties settings.

The comment "// Attention: DO NOT ADD... It will override and destroy the applicaiton properties settings // @EnableWebMvc" is a critical warning. It explicitly advises against adding `@EnableWebMvc` because it will likely conflict with Spring Boot's auto-configured web MVC settings. The intention is to allow Spring Boot to manage the web configuration based on the application's properties, rather than providing a custom (and potentially conflicting) configuration with `@EnableWebMvc`. The `MvcConfig` class is intended to *customize* Spring Boot's auto-configuration, not to *replace* it entirely. By adding only the interceptor, the class leverages existing Spring Boot functionality without disrupting the overall web configuration.
