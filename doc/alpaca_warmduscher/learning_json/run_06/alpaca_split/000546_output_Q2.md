The `myReload()` method's primary function is to fetch current heating data from the `HeatingDataService` and update the component's internal state (`heatingEntity`). It subscribes to the `getCurrent(false)` observable from the `HeatingDataService`. When the observable emits data (presumably a heating data object), the callback function within the subscribe method is executed. This callback:

1.  Updates the `heatingEntity` property of the component with the received data using `HeatingEntity.ofWebService(data)`.
2.  Emits the received data (`data`) through the `receivedNewTHValue` event emitter.

The `@Output() receivedNewTHValue = new EventEmitter();` declares an output property named `receivedNewTHValue` which is an instance of `EventEmitter`. This allows the component to communicate new heating data to its parent component.

Within `myReload()`, `this.receivedNewTHValue.emit(data);` is used to emit the received `data` as an event. The parent component can subscribe to this event to receive updates whenever the heating data changes. This is a common pattern in Angular for one-way data flow from child to parent.  Effectively the child component is notifying any parent components that are listening for updates about the Heating Data.
