Considering the nature of this data (time-series, numerical values, boolean flag), several database technologies are suitable. Options include:

*   **Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):** These are viable, especially if complex relationships with other entities exist.  We'd likely have a table with columns corresponding to each getter method. Indexing `measurementDateStart` and potentially `measurementDateEnd` would be critical for time-based queries.
*   **Time-Series Databases (TSDBs) (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB):** These are optimized *specifically* for time-series data, offering superior performance for storing and querying time-stamped data. They handle data ingestion rates and provide built-in functions for time-based analysis (e.g., averages over time windows). TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension, offering the best of both worlds â€“ SQL compatibility and TSDB optimizations.
*   **NoSQL Document Databases (e.g., MongoDB):** Could be used if flexibility in schema is highly valued, but generally not ideal for time-series data due to performance limitations compared to TSDBs or well-indexed relational databases.

Factors influencing the choice:

*   **Query Patterns:**  If queries are primarily time-based (e.g., "average delta in the last hour"), a TSDB or well-indexed relational database is best. If complex joins with other entities are frequent, a relational database might be preferable.
*   **Data Volume & Velocity:**  High data ingestion rates and large volumes favor TSDBs.
*   **Scalability Requirements:**  TSDBs and some NoSQL databases are generally easier to scale horizontally.
*   **Existing Infrastructure:**  Leveraging existing database infrastructure can reduce complexity and cost.
*   **Team Expertise:**  Choosing a technology the team is familiar with accelerates development and maintenance.
