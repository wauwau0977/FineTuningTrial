The primary purpose of overriding the `toString()` method is to provide a human-readable string representation of the object's state. The default implementation provided by `Object` usually returns a string that includes the class name and object hash code, which isn't very informative.

In the context of this application, the overridden `toString()` method likely serves for logging and debugging purposes. When logging instances of `InfoBean`, the overridden method will output the values of `deviceName`, `buildTimestampServer`, and `buildVersionServer`, providing a clear picture of the object's current configuration. This is particularly helpful when troubleshooting issues or monitoring the application's behavior. It could also be used in unit tests to easily verify the values of the bean's properties.  Without the override, log messages would only show the class name and hash code, making it harder to diagnose problems.
