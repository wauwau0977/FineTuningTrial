The name "UnsafeRunnable" suggests that running implementations of this interface carries inherent risks or requires careful consideration.  This likely stems from the fact that the `run()` method *throws* a checked exception (Exception, which is broad). A standard `Runnable` interface in Java typically does *not* declare exceptions in its `run()` method; any exceptions must be handled *within* the `run()` implementation. By *allowing* exceptions to be thrown, this interface suggests the operations performed within `run()` might not be fully controllable or predictable, or might involve operations that could easily fail in ways that the calling code needs to be aware of.

Scenarios might include:

*   **Operations interacting with external resources:** File I/O, network connections, database queries, etc. These operations are prone to various exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`, `SQLException`).
*   **Unvalidated Input:** If the `run()` method processes input from an untrusted source, it might need to throw exceptions to signal invalid or malicious data.
*   **Resource Intensive Operations:** Operations that could lead to `OutOfMemoryError` or other resource exhaustion problems.

The "Unsafe" prefix serves as a warning to developers that implementing this interface requires robust error handling.
