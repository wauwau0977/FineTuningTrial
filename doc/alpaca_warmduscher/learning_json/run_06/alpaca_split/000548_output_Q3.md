The `@Output()` decorator is an Angular decorator that marks a class property as an output binding. This allows the component to emit events that parent components can subscribe to.

In this case, `receivedNewTHValue` is an `EventEmitter`.  It's used to emit the latest heating data (`data`) received from the `heatingDataService`. The `myReload()` method, after receiving data from the service, calls `this.receivedNewTHValue.emit(data);`. This emits an event that any parent component listening for this output can react to. This is a key mechanism for communication between this gauge component and any component that needs to display or react to changes in the heating data.  Essentially, it's a way for this component to *inform* other components that the data has been updated.
