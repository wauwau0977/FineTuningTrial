Disabling Zone.js patches like `requestAnimationFrame` or `onProperty` is typically done to optimize performance or resolve compatibility issues. Zone.js, while powerful for its debugging and change detection capabilities, introduces overhead. Every patched event or function call incurs a cost.

A specific scenario where disabling `requestAnimationFrame` would be beneficial is within a complex animation loop, especially if the application *already* has a robust and efficient animation management system.  If the application is heavily reliant on custom animations and uses its own timing mechanisms, the Zone.js patch might interfere with those mechanisms or add unnecessary overhead.  For example, a game engine or a complex charting library might benefit from disabling it.

The trade-off is that you lose Zone.jsâ€™s ability to track and debug asynchronous operations within those animations. You also lose features like automatic change detection triggered by those animations if your application relies on that. Essentially, disabling the patch means you are taking control of the asynchronous behavior in that specific area and must handle any related concerns yourself.  You would need to ensure any change detection or state management related to the animation is handled manually. In simpler applications, the overhead from the patch might be negligible, but in performance-critical applications, it can become significant. Similarly, disabling `onProperty` patches can reduce overhead associated with event handling, but it also means you lose Zone.js's tracking of those events for debugging and change detection.
