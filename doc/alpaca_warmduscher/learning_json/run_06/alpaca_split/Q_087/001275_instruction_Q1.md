For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java'... 
Imagine a requirement to expose this startup time as part of an application health endpoint. How would you modify or extend this class (or related components) to support this functionality?
