Overriding `equals()` to only compare the `id` field means that two `HeatPumpEntity` objects are considered equal only if they have the same `id`, regardless of the values of their other fields (e.g., `boilerTemp`, `measurementDate`).  This is a valid approach if `id` is intended to be the primary key and the sole identifier for an entity.

However, it can lead to unexpected results or bugs if the application relies on comparing entities based on other fields. For example, if you were to store `HeatPumpEntity` objects in a `Set` or `Map`, it would treat objects with different values for `boilerTemp` or `measurementDate` but the same `id` as duplicates.

Similarly, if the application logic assumes that two `HeatPumpEntity` objects with the same `id` necessarily have the same properties, it could lead to incorrect calculations or data inconsistencies.  If the intention is to compare based on all fields, then the `equals()` method should consider all relevant fields in the comparison.  The overridden `hashCode()` method correctly relies on `id`, as it should be consistent with `equals()`.
