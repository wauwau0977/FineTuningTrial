The `init()` method serves as a setup routine for the service. Itâ€™s a place to perform all necessary initialization steps *before* the service can reliably provide data. This could include establishing connections to external devices (e.g., the heat pump itself), initializing database connections, loading configuration parameters, or pre-warming caches. The `Exception` declaration suggests the initialization process could encounter a variety of potential failures, such as network connectivity issues, invalid configuration, or resource unavailability.  A concrete implementation might acquire device drivers, validate hardware status, or establish authentication credentials.  It is important for the calling code to handle the thrown exception, as a failed initialization would prevent the service from operating correctly.
