```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "SessionRequest { " +
            "processingTime=" + processingTime +
            ", id=" + id +
            ", sessionId='" + sessionId + '\'' +
            ", clientId='" + clientId + '\'' +
            ", httpStatus='" + httpStatus + '\'' +
            ", ip='" + ip + '\'' +
            ", path='" + path + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```
The `toString()` method in the `SessionRequest` class is overridden to provide a human-readable string representation of the object. This is especially useful for debugging, logging, and general inspection of object state.

The method constructs a string that includes the values of several key fields: `processingTime`, `id`, `sessionId`, `clientId`, `httpStatus`, `ip`, and `path`. These fields were chosen because they represent the core attributes of a session request that are most relevant for understanding and diagnosing issues.

Specifically:

*   `processingTime`: Indicates how long the request took to process, which is critical for performance monitoring.
*   `id`: The unique identifier for the session request.
*   `sessionId`: Identifies the specific session the request belongs to.
*   `clientId`:  Identifies the client that initiated the request.
*   `httpStatus`: The HTTP status code returned for the request, signaling success or failure.
*   `ip`: The IP address of the client making the request.
*    `path`: The endpoint of the request

The method does *not* include all fields (e.g., `clientVersion`, `exception`) to keep the output concise and focused on the most frequently needed information.  The resulting string provides a quick and easy way to view the essential details of a `SessionRequest` instance without having to individually access each field.
