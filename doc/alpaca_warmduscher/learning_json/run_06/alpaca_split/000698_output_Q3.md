Constructor injection, as used here, offers several benefits over other forms of dependency injection, particularly in this context:

1.  **Immutability:** Constructor injection allows you to create immutable dependencies. Once the `MeteoDataPoller` object is created, the `meteoDataService` and `meteoSwissRepository` cannot be changed. This promotes predictability and thread safety.

2.  **Explicit Dependencies:** The constructor clearly defines all the dependencies required for the `MeteoDataPoller` to function. This makes the class easier to understand, test, and maintain.  Anyone looking at the constructor immediately knows what this class *needs* to operate.

3.  **Early Validation:** Dependencies are injected at object creation. If any dependency is missing or invalid, the error is detected immediately during the construction process, preventing runtime surprises. This contrasts with setter injection, where a dependency might be missing for a while before being set.

4.  **Testability:** Constructor injection makes unit testing easier. You can easily mock or stub the dependencies and inject them into the class during testing.

5.  **Required Dependencies:**  The constructor *forces* the provision of the dependencies.  With field or setter injection, a dependency could be left uninitialized, leading to a `NullPointerException` later.  The constructor guarantees that the class is always fully initialized with its required dependencies.

In this specific context, because `MeteoDataService` is initialized within the constructor, the object *requires* these dependencies to function. Constructor injection elegantly communicates this requirement and ensures that the `MeteoDataPoller` can always access its necessary resources.
