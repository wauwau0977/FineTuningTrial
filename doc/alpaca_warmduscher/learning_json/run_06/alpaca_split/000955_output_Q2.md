The name `getNumOfStatisticRecords1` is quite poor. It's cryptic and doesn't immediately convey what the method returns or what those records represent.  Several improvements could be made following clean code principles:

1. **Specificity:** Replace "StatisticRecords" with a more descriptive term. What *kind* of records are these?  For example, if these records are hourly readings, a better name might be `getNumOfHourlyReadings()`.

2. **Avoid Numbers in Names:** The "1" is particularly bad. It suggests there might be a `getNumOfStatisticRecords2()`, `getNumOfStatisticRecords3()`, etc., which is a code smell indicating a design flaw.  It doesn’t add any meaningful information.

3. **Clarity and Purpose:** The name should clearly express the method’s purpose. What are we counting?

**Improved Names (ranked in preference):**

*   `getNumOfHourlyReadings()` (If the records represent hourly data.)
*   `getNumOfRecords()` (If the record type is obvious from context or documentation.)
*   `getCountOfRecords()` (A more verbose but clear option.)

The best choice depends on the specific context of the application. The goal is to make the code self-documenting and easy to understand at a glance.
