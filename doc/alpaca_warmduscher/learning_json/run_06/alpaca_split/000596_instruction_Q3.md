For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...

```typescript
 it('should create', () => {
   expect(component).toBeTruthy();
 });
```

What is the purpose of this single test case?  What does `expect(component).toBeTruthy()` actually verify, and why is this often the first test written for a component?
