You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements a webhook endpoint for Dialogflow, a conversational AI platform. It receives requests from Dialogflow, retrieves heating data (specifically boiler temperature) from the `HeatPumpDataService`, and constructs a response message to be sent back to the user via Dialogflow. The primary purpose is to integrate a heating system's data into a conversational interface.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/DialogFlowWebhookController.java
- **Class Name(s):** `DialogFlowWebhookController`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Receive webhook requests from Dialogflow.
    - Parse the incoming request data.
    - Retrieve boiler temperature from the `HeatPumpDataService`.
    - Construct a response message containing the boiler temperature.
    - Send the response back to Dialogflow.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input**: A JSON string representing a Dialogflow webhook request.
    - **Output**: A JSON string representing a Dialogflow webhook response with the boiler temperature.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Receive the webhook request.
    2. Parse the request using JacksonFactory.
    3. Call `HeatPumpDataService` to get current boiler temperature.
    4. Create a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage` object.
    5. Populate the message with the boiler temperature.
    6. Create a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse` object and add the message.
    7. Serialize the response object into a JSON string using JacksonFactory.
    8. Return the JSON string as the response to Dialogflow.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interacts with `HeatPumpDataService` to retrieve heating data.
    - Interacts with Dialogflow via HTTP POST requests.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    -  The code doesn't explicitly handle exceptions from `HeatPumpDataService`.  If the service fails or returns invalid data, the application may throw an exception, which is not handled, leading to a failed webhook call.
    - Invalid JSON format in the incoming request will likely cause an exception during parsing with JacksonFactory. This is not explicitly handled.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The webhook should respond within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 500ms) to avoid timing out the Dialogflow request. The current implementation's performance depends on the `HeatPumpDataService`'s response time.
- **Scalability**: The controller is a single instance; scalability would require load balancing and potentially caching of heating data.
- **Security**:  No explicit security measures are implemented (e.g., authentication of Dialogflow requests).
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and well-structured. Adding more complex logic or data transformations may increase complexity.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Depends on the reliability of `HeatPumpDataService` and the underlying infrastructure. No fault tolerance mechanisms are implemented.
- **Usability**: Easy to integrate with Dialogflow as a webhook endpoint.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are identified.

## 5. Key Components

- **`webhook(String rawData)`**: This method is the main entry point for handling Dialogflow webhook requests. It parses the request, retrieves heating data, constructs the response, and returns it to Dialogflow.
- **`jacksonFactory`**: Used for parsing and serializing JSON data.
- **`heatPumpDataService`**:  Used to retrieve heating data (boiler temperature).
- **`GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse`, `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage`, `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText`**: Data structures used to create the Dialogflow response.
- **Logic Flow**: The main logic flow is described in the "Workflow/Logic" section of the Functional Requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Currently limited.  Exceptions from `HeatPumpDataService` are not explicitly caught or handled.
- **Classes**:  The code defines one main class: `DialogFlowWebhookController`. There are no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: No specific modules are defined beyond the standard Spring Boot web module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Java Collections Framework:** Lists are used in message construction.
- **String Manipulation:** Used for building and processing strings.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Boot**: Used for web application development and dependency injection.
- **Jackson**: Used for JSON parsing and serialization. (provided by Spring Boot)
- **Google Dialogflow API Client Libraries**: Provides the data structures (`GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest`, `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse`, etc.) for interacting with Dialogflow.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.heating.HeatPumpDataService`**:  Provides access to heating system data (boiler temperature).

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:**
    - Cache the boiler temperature to reduce the load on `HeatPumpDataService` and improve response time.
    - Investigate asynchronous processing if `HeatPumpDataService` calls are slow.
- **Code Readability**:
    - Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
    - Consider using a more descriptive variable names.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Implement authentication to verify that the webhook request originates from a trusted source (Dialogflow).
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Deploy multiple instances of the controller behind a load balancer.
    - Implement caching to reduce the load on the `HeatPumpDataService`.
- **Error Handling**:
    - Add `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during JSON parsing or when calling `HeatPumpDataService`.
    - Log errors for debugging purposes.
    - Return a meaningful error message to Dialogflow if an error occurs.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the controller, including error handling.
