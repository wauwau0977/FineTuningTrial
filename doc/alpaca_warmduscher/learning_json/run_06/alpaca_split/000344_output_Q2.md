The application likely handles invalid date ranges through reactive form validation, which is indicated by the use of `[formGroup]` and `formControlName` on the input elements. Here's a breakdown of the expected behavior and responsible components:

**Expected Behavior:**

1.  **Client-Side Validation:** When the user submits the form (via the `(ngSubmit)="onMyFormSubmit()"` event), the reactive form will trigger validation rules.  A custom validator function (likely in the component's TypeScript file) should be implemented to check if `customFromDate` is before `customToDate`.
2.  **Error Display:** If the `customToDate` is before `customFromDate`, the form will be marked as invalid. The Angular Material `mat-form-field` components will automatically display error messages beneath the respective input fields, informing the user about the invalid date range.  This is a standard feature of Angular Material forms.
3.  **Form Submission Prevention:** The form submission should be prevented until the date range is valid.  The `onMyFormSubmit()` method will only execute if the `myForm.valid` property is true.

**Responsible Components (Beyond HTML):**

1.  **Component TypeScript File (`boiler-chart.component.ts`):**
    *   **Reactive Form Definition:** This file will contain the definition of the `myForm` reactive form group and its associated form controls (`customFromDate`, `customToDate`, `customFromDateTimePart`, `customToDateTimePart`, `chartDataPoints`, `intervalAutoMatching`).
    *   **Custom Validator:** A custom validator function will be implemented to compare `customFromDate` and `customToDate`. This validator would be added to the form control definition.
    *   **`onMyFormSubmit()` Method:** This method handles the form submission. It should check `myForm.valid` before processing the data.
2.  **Service (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary for client-side validation, a service could be used to encapsulate the date validation logic and make it reusable across multiple components.
3.  **Component HTML (This file):** While the HTML defines the structure of the form, it relies on the TypeScript file for the validation logic and to determine whether to show error messages.

**In summary:** The reactive forms system, combined with a custom validator in the component's TypeScript file, enforces the date range validation. Angular Material handles the presentation of error messages, preventing submission until valid dates are entered. The `onMyFormSubmit` function relies on `myForm.valid` to only trigger processing when the form is valid.
