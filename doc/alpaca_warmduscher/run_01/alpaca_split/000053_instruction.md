This is a comprehensive review of the provided code, focusing on readability, maintainability, and potential performance improvements.  The code consists of several native SQL queries used to retrieve and aggregate heat pump data.

**Overall Observations:**

* **Complexity:** The queries are *extremely* complex, involving numerous subqueries, window functions, and calculations. This makes them difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.
* **Native SQL:** Using native SQL can be efficient, but it ties the application tightly to a specific database. Consider using a JPA/Hibernate ORM for better portability.
* **Naming:** Some names are inconsistent or lack clarity.
* **Repetition:** There's repeated logic and structures across different queries.
* **Performance:** While native SQL *can* be optimized, the current complexity makes it hard to assess performance without proper indexing and execution plans.

**Detailed Review & Suggestions (Query by Query):**

I'll break down each query with suggestions.  Due to the length, I'll focus on the most significant improvements.

**1. `getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek`**

* **Complexity:**  High.  The nested subqueries and `ORDER BY` clauses make it hard to follow.
* **Suggestion:**  Consider breaking down this query into smaller, more manageable steps.  Could you create temporary tables or common table expressions (CTEs) to pre-calculate intermediate results?
* **Ordering:**  The `order by year1, doy, hour_of_day` at the end seems redundant given the complex ordering within the subqueries.

**2. `getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` (Duplicated Query)**

* **Problem:**  The code has two methods with the same name (`getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek`). This is a critical error and will lead to compilation/runtime issues. You must resolve this duplication.
* **Solution:** Rename one of the methods.

**3. `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats`**

* **Complexity:** *Extremely* high. This is the most complex query.
* **Decomposition:**  Break this query down aggressively.  Here's a potential approach:
    * **Stage 1: Identify Compressor Runtime:** Create a query that focuses solely on identifying periods when the compressor is running for a sufficient duration (e.g., > 180 seconds). This could involve using window functions to calculate running totals or differences in timestamps.
    * **Stage 2: Filter Valid Readings:** Filter the raw data to include only readings that fall within the identified compressor runtime periods *and* meet the criteria for excluding startup and shutdown phases.
    * **Stage 3: Aggregate Data:** Calculate the required statistics (average, min, max, etc.) on the filtered data.
* **`seq_id` Calculation:** The calculation of `seq_id` using `row_number() over ...` is a common technique for identifying gaps and islands in time series data. However, it's complex and could be optimized with appropriate indexing.
* **Redundant `AND` Conditions:** Review the `AND` conditions within the `WHERE` clauses.  Are any redundant or can be simplified?
* **Window Function Usage:**  While window functions are powerful, overuse can impact performance.  Consider whether some calculations can be done with simpler aggregations or joins.
* **Comments:** More detailed comments explaining the purpose of each subquery and calculation would significantly improve readability.



**General Recommendations (Applicable to all queries):**

* **Consistent Naming:** Use a consistent naming convention for variables, tables, and columns.  Descriptive names are crucial.  Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-established.
* **Formatting:**  Format the SQL code consistently (indentation, capitalization, line breaks).  This significantly improves readability.  Use a SQL formatter tool.
* **Comments:** Add comments explaining the purpose of each query, the logic behind the calculations, and any assumptions made.
* **Indexing:**  Ensure that the tables involved have appropriate indexes on the columns used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.  This is *critical* for performance.
* **Execution Plans:**  Use your database's query execution plan tool to analyze the performance of each query. Identify bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.
* **Data Modeling:** Review your data model. Are the tables structured in a way that supports efficient querying?  Consider whether normalization or denormalization might be beneficial.
* **Avoid `SELECT *`:**  Always specify the columns you need instead of using `SELECT *`. This reduces the amount of data transferred and can improve performance.
* **Parameterization:**  Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and improve performance.
* **Consider a Query Builder:**  For complex queries, consider using a query builder library to generate the SQL dynamically. This can improve readability and maintainability.
* **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**  Consider using an ORM like JPA/Hibernate. While it might introduce some overhead, it can provide benefits such as portability, type safety, and reduced boilerplate code.

**Refactoring Approach:**

1. **Start with the most complex query (`getSoleDeltaInOperationStats`).**
2. **Decompose it into smaller, more manageable steps.**
3. **Create temporary tables or CTEs to store intermediate results.**
4. **Test each step thoroughly.**
5. **Repeat the process for the other queries.**
6. **Once you have refactored the queries, focus on optimization (indexing, execution plans).**

**Example of Decomposition (Conceptual - for `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats`):**

```sql
-- Stage 1: Identify Compressor Runtime
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE CompressorRuntimes AS
SELECT
    -- Columns to identify a runtime period (e.g., start timestamp, end timestamp)
    -- Logic to identify periods when the compressor is running for a sufficient duration
FROM heat_pump;

-- Stage 2: Filter Valid Readings
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ValidReadings AS
SELECT
    -- Columns from heat_pump
    -- Filter to include only readings that fall within the identified compressor runtime periods
    -- Filter to exclude startup and shutdown phases
FROM heat_pump
JOIN CompressorRuntimes ON ...;

-- Stage 3: Aggregate Data
SELECT
    -- Calculate the required statistics (average, min, max, etc.)
FROM ValidReadings
GROUP BY ...;
```

**Disclaimer:**

This review is based on the provided code snippet and limited context.  A more thorough review would require a deeper understanding of the application's requirements, data model, and performance goals.

Remember to back up your database before making any changes to the SQL queries.  Test each change thoroughly to ensure that it does not introduce any regressions.
