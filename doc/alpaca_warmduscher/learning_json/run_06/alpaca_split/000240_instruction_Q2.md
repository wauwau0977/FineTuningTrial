For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts' with name 'my-http-interceptor.service.ts'... 
Consider this snippet from the `intercept` method:

```typescript
let clientId = this.clientIdService.getClientId();
let clientVersion = environment.buildTimestampClient;
const modifiedReq = req.clone({
  headers: req.headers
    .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID, clientId)
    .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION, clientVersion)
});
```

What potential issues could arise if `this.clientIdService.getClientId()` returns a value *after* the `intercept` method has already started executing, but *before* the `modifiedReq` object is created?  How would you address this potential issue?
