The generic type `T` makes this interface highly versatile.  Here are some use cases:

*   **Database Transactions:** `T` could be a database transaction object. `before` could validate the transaction data, and `after` could log the transaction details or perform cleanup.
*   **File Locking:** `T` could be a file lock object. `before` could check file permissions, and `after` could release the lock and write access logs.
*   **Cache Operations:** `T` could be a cache entry. `before` could validate data before caching, and `after` could update cache statistics.
*   **Network Connections:** `T` could be a network connection object.  `before` could authenticate the connection, and `after` could close the connection or report usage.

**Specific Sensor Data Processing Pipeline Scenario:**

Imagine a pipeline that processes data from temperature sensors. `T` could represent a batch of sensor readings.

*   **`before(batchOfReadings)`:**  A hook could validate the incoming readings: checking for out-of-range values, missing timestamps, or sensor IDs. Invalid readings could be flagged or corrected.
*   **`after(batchOfReadings)`:** A hook could publish the validated readings to a data storage system (like a database or time-series database). Another hook could trigger an alert if the average temperature exceeds a threshold, or generate reports for data analysis.

Using hooks allows you to add data validation, logging, alerting, and reporting logic *without* modifying the core mutex logic that synchronizes access to sensor data.
