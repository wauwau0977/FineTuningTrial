The indexes defined on the `SESSION_REQUEST` table are designed to speed up data retrieval based on specific columns. `SESSION_REQUEST_IX_1` on `requestDate` would greatly improve the performance of queries filtering by request date ranges (e.g., "find all requests from the last hour"). `SESSION_REQUEST_IX_2` on `clientId` would speed up queries searching for requests originating from a specific client.  `SESSION_REQUEST_IX_3` on `sessionId` would accelerate queries that retrieve requests associated with a particular session. 

These indexes work by creating a sorted structure for those columns, allowing the database to locate relevant rows more efficiently without scanning the entire table. Queries involving `WHERE` clauses on `requestDate`, `clientId`, or `sessionId` would likely benefit most. However, it's important to note that indexes add overhead to write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because the index also needs to be updated. Therefore, choosing the right indexes requires balancing read performance gains with write performance costs.
