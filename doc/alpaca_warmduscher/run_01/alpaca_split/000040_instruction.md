You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a JPA entity class `SessionRequest` representing a request made by a client. It's designed to store information about each request, including timestamps, client identifiers, request paths, processing time, HTTP status codes, exceptions, and IP address. The primary purpose is to facilitate logging and analysis of client interactions with the server.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionRequest.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `SessionRequest`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Capture and store details of client requests.
    - Provide a unique identifier for each request.
    - Store relevant information for debugging and analysis.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** The class attributes are populated through setter methods from request processing logic.
    - **Outputs:** The object itself, used for persistence (database storage).
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    - An instance of `SessionRequest` is created when a client request is received.
    - The request details (sessionId, clientId, path, processingTime, etc.) are set via setter methods.
    - The object is persisted to the database through a JPA provider.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Database:** Interaction with a database to store and retrieve `SessionRequest` objects. (Via JPA)
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    -  The `id` is automatically generated using `UUIDUtils`, ensuring uniqueness.
    -  Null values for some attributes (e.g., `exception`) are acceptable.
    -  Error handling regarding database persistence is not handled within this class itself but rather by the persistence layer.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - Object creation and attribute setting should be fast, as it's part of the request processing pipeline.
- **Scalability:**
    - The entity design should support efficient querying and indexing for large volumes of request data. (Achieved via database indexes.)
- **Security:**
    - No direct security concerns within this class.  Database access control and data protection are handled externally.
- **Maintainability:**
    - The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability:**
    - The class itself is not critical for system availability; database persistence is the critical component.
- **Usability:**
    -  The class is intended for internal use within the application.
- **Compliance:**
    - No specific compliance requirements are apparent from the code itself.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - **`SessionRequest()`:** Constructor, initializes the `id` and `requestDate`.
    - **Getters & Setters:** Access and modify the class attributes.
    - **`toString()`:** Provides a string representation of the object for debugging purposes.
    - **`equals(Object o)`:** Implements object equality based on the `id` attribute.
    - **`hashCode()`:** Implements a hash code based on the `id` attribute.
- **Important logic flows:**
    - Object creation, attribute setting, and database persistence are the core flows.
- **Error handling:**
    - No explicit error handling within the class itself.
- **Classes:**
    - No subclasses defined.
- **Modules:**
    - The class belongs to the `db.entity` package, indicating its role as a database entity.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures:** Uses primitive data types (String, Date, Long) and Objects.
- **Date/Time:** Uses `java.util.Date` for storing the request timestamp.
- **String manipulation:** Uses `String` class methods.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Used for object-relational mapping and database persistence (Implicit dependency via annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@Table`, `@Index`).
- **UUIDUtils:** Used for generating unique IDs. (Internal Utility Class)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.UUIDUtils`**: Utility class to generate unique IDs for the session requests.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:**  Consider using a more efficient date/time library (e.g., `java.time`) instead of `java.util.Date`.
- **Code Readability:**  The class is relatively simple and readable.
- **Security Improvements:** No specific security concerns within this class, but ensure proper database access control and data protection mechanisms are in place.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  Ensure that the database indexes are optimized for common query patterns. Consider database partitioning or sharding for very large volumes of data.
