The conditions `seconds_since_toggle_on > 180` and `seconds_before_toggle_off > 60` are crucial for filtering out data that is likely to be unreliable or unrepresentative of the heat pump's sustained performance.  They are designed to isolate measurements taken during a stabilized operating period, excluding transient states at the beginning and end of compressor cycles.

*   `seconds_since_toggle_on > 180`: This condition ensures that only measurements taken *after* the compressor has been running for at least 180 seconds (3 minutes) are included.  This helps to exclude the initial startup phase, where the system is still adjusting and temperatures may not be representative of steady-state operation.  It avoids including data while the temperature is still changing.

*   `seconds_before_toggle_off > 60`: This condition ensures that only measurements taken *before* the compressor shuts off for less than 60 seconds are included. This avoids capturing data during the system's shutdown phase, where temperatures may be decreasing and may not accurately reflect the system's normal operating performance.

By applying these filters, the query focuses on data that represents the heat pump operating in a stable, sustained manner, thus improving the accuracy and reliability of the collected statistics.  The goal is to accurately represent how the heat pump performs when it is fully operational.
