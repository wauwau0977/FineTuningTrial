For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java'... 
Assume you have a Spring Bean that needs to record the startup time. How would you inject this `StartupData` class into that Bean, and how would you populate the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` value *after* the application context has finished loading? Explain the use of `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner`.
