You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code defines a data entity class, `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`, used to represent statistical data related to sole/in/out delta measurements during heating operations.  It stores values like average, minimum, and maximum delta readings within a specific time window, along with compressor state and probe count. The class provides methods for creating instances, returning an empty instance, and constructing instances from data received from a web service.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: 
    - Represent statistical data of sole/in/out delta measurements.
    - Create instances with specified data.
    - Create an empty instance with default values.
    - Parse data from a web service response and create an instance.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** Measurement date start, measurement date end, sole in/out delta average, min, max, compressor state, probe count, and web service data.
    - **Outputs:** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` object.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - The constructor initializes the entity's attributes.
    - `emptyInstance()` returns a default instance with initial values.
    - `ofWebService()` parses web service data and maps it to the entityâ€™s attributes. It handles null data by returning an empty instance.
- **External Interactions**:
    - `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` is called to convert date strings received from the web service to `Date` objects.  This is a dependency on the `HeatingDataService`.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - `ofWebService()` handles the case where the input `data` is null, returning an `emptyInstance()` to prevent errors.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The class is relatively simple and should have minimal performance impact. Object creation and attribute access are expected to be fast.
- **Maintainability**: The class is straightforward with a simple constructor and static methods, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The handling of null data in `ofWebService()` improves the reliability of the application.
- **Usability**: The class provides a clear and concise representation of the data, making it easy to use in other parts of the application.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - **`constructor()`**: Initializes the entity's properties.
    - **`emptyInstance()`**: Returns a new instance with default values.
    - **`ofWebService(data: any)`**: Creates an instance from data received from a web service.
- **Important Logic Flows**:
    - The primary logic flow is object creation, either with direct values or parsed from web service data.  The `ofWebService` method includes a null check for robustness.
- **Error Handling**:
    - The `ofWebService()` method handles null input data by returning an empty instance, preventing potential errors.
- **Classes**:
    - No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:
    - The class is a standalone entity class.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures:  Uses primitive data types like `Date` and `number`, as well as a class definition.
- Object-oriented programming: Utilizes classes, constructors, and static methods.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None explicitly used in the provided code.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`**:  Specifically, the `convertDate()` method is called to convert date strings from the web service to `Date` objects.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**:  No significant performance bottlenecks are apparent in the provided code.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable.  Adding JSDoc comments for each property and method would further improve clarity.
- **Security Improvements**: No immediate security concerns are apparent.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  The class itself does not pose any scalability issues. However, consider the scalability of the `HeatingDataService` if it handles a large volume of date conversions.
