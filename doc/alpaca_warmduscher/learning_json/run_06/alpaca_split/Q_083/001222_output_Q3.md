The `ReentrantLock` is a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) that provides access to a shared resource by only one thread at a time. In this code, it's used to protect the `syncedObject` from concurrent access, ensuring that operations performed on it are thread-safe.

Here's why `ReentrantLock` is chosen over the simpler `synchronized` keyword:

1. **Flexibility and Control:** `ReentrantLock` offers more flexibility and control than `synchronized`. `synchronized` is a language-level construct, while `ReentrantLock` is a class within the Java concurrency utilities. This means `ReentrantLock` offers more features and configuration options.

2. **TryLock:** `ReentrantLock` provides the `tryLock()` method, which allows a thread to attempt to acquire the lock without blocking indefinitely. This can be useful for implementing timeout mechanisms or for avoiding deadlocks.

3. **Interruptible Lock Acquisition:**  A thread waiting to acquire a `ReentrantLock` can be interrupted, allowing for more responsive applications.  `synchronized` doesn't provide this feature.

4. **Fairness:** `ReentrantLock` can be constructed with a fairness policy. A fair lock grants access to waiting threads in the order they requested it (though it comes with a performance cost).  `synchronized` doesn't guarantee any particular order of access.

5. **Multiple Condition Objects:** `ReentrantLock` supports multiple `Condition` objects, allowing for more complex synchronization scenarios than `synchronized` (which uses the object itself as the condition).

In the context of `GlobalSynced`, the `ReentrantLock` provides a robust and flexible way to ensure that only one thread can operate on the `syncedObject` at a time. The `reentrant` characteristic is important because the same thread might acquire the lock multiple times (e.g., if the `operateGlobalSynced` method internally calls other methods that also require the lock). The ability to use features like `tryLock()` or fairness policies can also be valuable depending on the specific requirements of the application.
