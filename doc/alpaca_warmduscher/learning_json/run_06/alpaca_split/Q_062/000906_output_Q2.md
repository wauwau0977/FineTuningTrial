Initializing `sessionCreateDate` directly with `new Date()` presents a significant issue, particularly in a multi-threaded environment. The problem is that all instances of `SessionDevice` created concurrently will share the *same* `Date` object, effectively recording the time of the *first* object created.

Here's why:

1.  **Shared Instance:** `new Date()` creates a single `Date` object and assigns its reference to multiple `SessionDevice` instances.
2.  **Mutation:** `Date` objects are mutable. If one `SessionDevice` modifies the `sessionCreateDate`, all other instances referencing that same `Date` object will see the change.
3.  **Concurrency Issues:** In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads could be creating `SessionDevice` objects simultaneously. They would all be assigned the same `Date` instance, leading to incorrect timestamps and potentially data corruption.

The fix is to create a *new* `Date` object for each instance of `SessionDevice`.  For example:

```java
private Date sessionCreateDate;

public SessionDevice() {
    this.sessionCreateDate = new Date();
}
```

This ensures that each instance has its own unique timestamp, preventing concurrency issues and maintaining data integrity.
