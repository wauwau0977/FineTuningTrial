Reducing `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` to 15 would *significantly* decrease the uniqueness of the generated short text UUIDs.  Here's why:

* **Reduced Character Space:** A shorter string length means fewer possible combinations of characters.  The Base58 alphabet has a limited number of characters.

* **Increased Collision Probability:**  With fewer possible strings, the probability of generating duplicate short text UUIDs increases dramatically. The number of possible values drops exponentially with decreased length.

* **Impact on System Reliability:** If these short text UUIDs are used as identifiers (e.g., in a database), collisions could lead to data corruption, incorrect mappings, or application failures.

Here are the considerations I'd make:

1. **Recalculate Collision Probability:**  I'd calculate the estimated collision probability based on the number of expected UUIDs generated and the available character space with the new length. This would help to quantify the risk.

2. **Re-evaluate Requirements:** I would investigate *why* a shorter length is desired. Is it a storage constraint, a UI limitation, or something else?  If possible, I would advocate for maintaining a longer length to preserve uniqueness.

3. **Collision Detection and Handling:** If a shorter length is unavoidable, I would implement a robust collision detection mechanism. This could involve storing all generated UUIDs in a set or database and checking for duplicates before assigning a new one.  I would also need a strategy for handling collisions, such as regenerating a new UUID or returning an error.

4. **Consider Alternative Approaches:** Explore alternative approaches to reducing the size of the UUID representation, such as using a different encoding scheme or compressing the UUID.

5. **Performance Impact:** Collision detection and handling will add overhead.  I would need to measure the performance impact and ensure that it is acceptable.

In summary, reducing the length would be a risky change. I would only do it if absolutely necessary, and I would carefully consider the trade-offs and implement appropriate mitigation strategies. The goal is to minimize the probability of collisions and ensure the integrity of the identifiers.
