You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below```
# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This component, `BoilerChartComponent`, is responsible for fetching and displaying various charts related to boiler statistics within the 'Warmduscher' application. It retrieves data for boiler average temperature, hourly usage, daily usage, sole temperature deltas and displays it using Highcharts. The component subscribes to multiple services to fetch the necessary data and updates charts accordingly.  It includes data transformation and pre-processing logic to prepare data for chart rendering.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerChartComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations:**
    - Fetch data from multiple backend services (presumably REST APIs).
    - Transform and prepare the fetched data for chart display.
    - Generate and update Highcharts with the processed data.
    - Handle chart updates based on time intervals.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**  None directly from the user. Data is fetched automatically. Component relies on internal timers and service subscriptions.
    - **Outputs:** Visual representation of boiler statistics via Highcharts. Console logs for debugging.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. Component initializes by subscribing to multiple services (`serviceBoilerStatsByHour`, `serviceBoilerStatsDayOfWeek`, `serviceSoleDeltaInOperationStats`, etc.).
    2. Each service subscription triggers a `next` event handler that processes the received data.
    3. Data transformation occurs within each `next` handler.
    4. Transformed data is then used to update the relevant chart's data series.
    5. A recurring timer (using `interval`) triggers a `myReload()` function which presumably re-fetches data and updates charts at regular intervals.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Interacts with backend services (API calls assumed) to retrieve data. The component doesn't show the actual implementations, only the subscriptions.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - Handles cases where data is missing by initializing chart data series with default values (e.g., pushing 0 for missing hourly stats).
    - Includes loading indicators (using `loading` flags) to provide feedback during data fetching.
    - Console logs are used for error handling. Detailed error handling like user notifications is not implemented.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
    - The component should fetch and display data within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds) to provide a responsive user experience. The recurring timer is set to 3 hours (180 * 60 * 1000) which suggests a tolerance for some delay.
- **Scalability:** Not directly addressed in the provided code. Scalability would depend on the backend services.
- **Security:** Not explicitly addressed in the code. Security considerations would depend on the backend service implementation and data transmission protocols.
- **Maintainability:**
    - The code is relatively complex due to the multiple service subscriptions and data transformation logic. Refactoring into smaller, more modular functions could improve maintainability.
    - Consistent coding style and clear comments could enhance readability.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The component relies on the availability of backend services. Error handling is limited to console logging.
- **Usability:**  The usability is tied to the effectiveness of the charts and the clarity of the data presented.
- **Compliance:** Not explicitly addressed in the code.

## 5. Key Components
- **`BoilerChartComponent`:** The main component responsible for fetching data, processing it, and updating Highcharts.
- **Data Transformation Functions:** Within each service subscription handler, data is transformed and prepared for chart rendering (e.g., mapping service responses to chart data series).
- **Highcharts Options:**  `chartOptionsBoilerAverageTemp`, `chartOptionsBoilerDeltaTemp`, etc., define the configuration of each chart.
- **Timer:** The `interval` based timer triggers data re-fetching and chart updates.
- **`myReload()`:**  A function responsible for re-fetching data from services and updating charts, called by the timer.
- **Error handling:** Basic `console.log` statements for error reporting.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript: The code is written in TypeScript, utilizing features like classes, interfaces, and type annotations.
- Promises and Observables: The component uses Observables (from RxJS) for handling asynchronous data streams from the backend services.
- Data Structures: Arrays and Maps are used extensively to store and process data.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Highcharts:** A JavaScript charting library used for creating and displaying charts.
- **RxJS:** A reactive programming library used for handling asynchronous data streams.
- **TypeScript:** Language for development.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- Multiple service classes (e.g., `serviceBoilerStatsByHour`, `serviceBoilerStatsDayOfWeek`) are used to fetch data. The specific implementations of these services are not shown in the code.
- Data Entities (`BoilerStatsByHourEntity`, `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity`, etc.) are used to represent the data retrieved from the backend services.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Implement caching to reduce the number of API calls.
    - Optimize data transformation logic to improve processing speed.
    - Consider using change detection strategies to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- **Code Readability:**
    - Refactor large functions into smaller, more modular functions.
    - Add more descriptive comments to explain complex logic.
    - Use consistent coding style throughout the component.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Validate and sanitize data received from backend services to prevent XSS or other security vulnerabilities.
    - Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing backend services.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Consider using a more scalable backend architecture to handle increased load.
    - Implement pagination or other techniques to reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling mechanisms, such as displaying user-friendly error messages or logging errors to a central logging system.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the component and ensure that it behaves as expected.
