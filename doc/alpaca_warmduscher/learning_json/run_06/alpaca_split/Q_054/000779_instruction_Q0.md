You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code defines a repository interface, `HeatPumpRepository`, responsible for retrieving heat pump measurements from a database. It provides a method to query measurements within a specified date range, limit the number of returned rows, and group the measurements into time intervals. This likely forms part of a backend system for monitoring and analyzing heat pump performance within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatPumpRepository`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Retrieve heat pump measurements from a database based on specified criteria.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**:
        - `measurementDateStart`: Date representing the start of the measurement period.
        - `measurementDateEnd`: Date representing the end of the measurement period.
        - `maxRows`: Integer limiting the maximum number of rows returned.
        - `groupEveryNthSecond`: Integer defining the time interval (in seconds) for grouping measurements.
    - **Outputs**: A collection of heat pump measurements (specific data type not defined in the provided code, assumed to be a List or similar).
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Receives input parameters (date range, row limit, grouping interval).
    2. Constructs a database query based on these parameters.
    3. Executes the query against the database.
    4. Retrieves the results.
    5. Returns the results as a collection of heat pump measurements.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **Database Query**: The code interacts directly with a database to retrieve data. The specific database technology is not apparent from the code snippet.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Invalid Date Range**: Handle cases where `measurementDateStart` is after `measurementDateEnd`. (Not explicitly handled in provided code)
    - **Zero/Negative `maxRows`**: Handle invalid `maxRows` values, potentially defaulting to a reasonable maximum or throwing an exception. (Not explicitly handled in provided code)
    - **Zero/Negative `groupEveryNthSecond`**: Handle invalid grouping interval values, potentially defaulting to a reasonable interval or throwing an exception. (Not explicitly handled in provided code)
    - **No Data Found**: Handle cases where the query returns no results. (Assumed to return an empty collection)
    - **Database Connection Errors**: Implement robust error handling to manage database connection failures. (Not explicitly handled in provided code)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The query should execute reasonably quickly, particularly for common date ranges and grouping intervals.  Response time depends heavily on database indexing and data volume.
- **Scalability**: The repository should be able to handle a large volume of heat pump measurements and a high number of concurrent requests without performance degradation. Database indexing and connection pooling will be crucial.
- **Security**: Database access should be secured with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Data should be protected from unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability**: The code should be well-structured and documented to facilitate future maintenance and modifications.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The repository should be reliable and available, with minimal downtime.  Error handling and fault tolerance are important considerations.
- **Usability**: The interface is simple to use and understand by other developers.

## 5. Key Components
- **`HeatPumpRepository` Interface**: Defines the contract for retrieving heat pump measurements.
- **`getMeasurements` Function**: This is the core function responsible for querying the database and retrieving measurements. The function takes the date range, max rows, and grouping interval as parameters.
- **Error Handling**: The provided code snippet does not demonstrate explicit error handling. Robust error handling should be implemented to manage database connection errors, invalid input parameters, and other potential exceptions.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined in the provided code.
- **Modules**: The code appears to be part of a larger data access layer module within the `thserver` application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **Java Date API**: Used for handling date and time values.
- **Collections Framework**: Used for returning collections of measurements (e.g., List, Set).
- **Interfaces**: Used to define the repository contract.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Data JPA (Likely)**:  Given the interface definition and the likely use case, Spring Data JPA is likely used to simplify database access and handle object-relational mapping. This is inferred as the code does not show explicit JDBC connections or query execution.
- **Database Driver**: A JDBC driver specific to the database technology being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **Potential Database Configuration**: Dependencies on internal modules providing database connection details and configuration. (Not visible from code)
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:  The measurements returned likely map to internal DTOs defining the structure of the heat pump data. (Not visible from code)

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**:
    - **Database Indexing**: Ensure appropriate indexes are created on the `measurement_date` column to speed up queries based on date ranges.
    - **Query Optimization**: Analyze the generated SQL queries and optimize them for performance.
- **Code Readability**:  The code is already relatively readable given the limited snippet.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - **Prepared Statements**: Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  (Likely handled by Spring Data JPA automatically)
    - **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize input parameters to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) or other security attacks.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - **Connection Pooling**: Implement database connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections. (Likely handled by Spring Data JPA automatically)
    - **Caching**: Consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
    - **Asynchronous Processing**:  For very large date ranges or complex queries, consider processing the query asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage database connection errors, invalid input parameters, and other potential exceptions.  Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring.
