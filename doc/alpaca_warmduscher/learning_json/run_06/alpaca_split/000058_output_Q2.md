Having all styles in a single, global stylesheet in a large-scale application like 'Warmduscher' presents several drawbacks:

*   **Specificity Issues:**  As the stylesheet grows, managing CSS specificity becomes increasingly difficult.  Rules can unintentionally override each other, leading to unexpected visual results.
*   **Performance Impacts:**  Large stylesheets can increase page load times, negatively impacting user experience.  Browsers have to parse and apply all the styles, even those not used on the current page.
*   **Maintainability:**  Finding and modifying specific styles becomes challenging.  Changes in one area might unintentionally affect other parts of the application.
*   **Code Conflicts:** In a team environment, multiple developers working on the same stylesheet can lead to conflicts and merge issues.
*   **Reusability:**  It's difficult to reuse styles in different components or sections of the application without duplicating code.

To mitigate these drawbacks and improve scalability and maintainability, the following strategies could be employed:

1.  **Component-Based Styling:** Adopt a component-based styling approach. Encapsulate styles within the components they apply to, using techniques like CSS Modules, styled-components, or Angular's built-in component styling (using the `styleUrls` property in the component decorator). This provides encapsulation and avoids style conflicts.

2.  **Modularize the Stylesheet:** Break down the global stylesheet into smaller, more manageable modules based on functionality or UI sections (e.g., `_buttons.sass`, `_forms.sass`, `_navigation.sass`). Import these modules into a main `styles.sass` file.

3.  **CSS-in-JS:** Consider using a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion. These libraries allow you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript components, providing better encapsulation, theming support, and dynamic styling capabilities.

4.  **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier):** Adopt a naming convention like BEM to make your CSS more organized, predictable, and maintainable.

5.  **Code Splitting:** Use code splitting techniques to load only the CSS needed for the current page or section of the application.  This can improve initial page load times.

6.  **Stylelint:**  Integrate a linter like Stylelint into your development workflow to enforce coding standards and identify potential styling issues.
