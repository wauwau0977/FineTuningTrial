For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.spec.ts' with name 'client-id.service.spec.ts'... 
Consider the following snippet from the test suite:
```typescript
it("test create client id", () => {
   let serviceID1 = service.getClientId();
   let serviceID2 = service.getClientId();
   expect(serviceID1).toEqual(serviceID2);
});
```
What potential problems could arise from relying solely on this test to ensure the `getClientId()` method is functioning correctly, and how could you refactor this test to be more robust?
