For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java' with name 'GlobalSynced.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
public GlobalSynced(T syncedObject, Hooks<T> hooks) {
    this.syncedObject = syncedObject;
    this.hooks = hooks;
}
```

What is the purpose of the `Hooks<T>` parameter in the constructor of the `GlobalSynced` class, and how might it be used to extend the functionality of this class without modifying its core logic?
