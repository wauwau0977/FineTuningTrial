The `@Repository` annotation is a Spring stereotype annotation. It signifies that the `AuditLogRepository` interface is a component responsible for data access operations. This annotation tells Spring to automatically detect and register this interface as a Spring bean during application startup. More importantly, it allows Spring to apply appropriate data access exception translation, converting database-specific exceptions (like SQLException) into more generic and manageable Spring Data Access Exceptions. This improves the robustness and maintainability of the application by providing a consistent error handling mechanism. Although an interface, Spring uses techniques like proxy-based AOP to manage and inject dependencies into the implementation provided by Spring Data JPA.
