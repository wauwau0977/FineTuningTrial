If the title was dynamically set in the component’s logic (e.g., loaded from a service, determined by user preferences), accessing `app.title` directly might not reflect the rendered title immediately. We need to ensure the component's change detection has run *after* the dynamic title is set.

Here's how I'd modify the test:

```typescript
it(`should have as title 'thserver-client'`, async () => { // Mark test as async
   const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
   const app = fixture.componentInstance;

   // Simulate the logic that sets the dynamic title
   // For example, if the title is set in ngOnInit:
   fixture.detectChanges(); // Trigger ngOnInit and any title setting logic.

   // Now check the title
   expect(app.title).toEqual('thserver-client');
});
```

Key changes:

1.  **`async` keyword**: We mark the test as `async` because `fixture.detectChanges()` might trigger asynchronous operations.
2.  **`fixture.detectChanges()` before assertion**: This is the crucial step. We call `fixture.detectChanges()` *before* the `expect` statement to ensure that the component's change detection has run, updating `app.title` with the dynamically set value.
3.  The rest of the test remains the same, verifying that the `app.title` property now holds the correct dynamically set value.

This approach ensures that the test accurately reflects the dynamically set title and avoids false negatives due to the title not being updated before the assertion.  If the dynamic title setting involved an asynchronous operation (e.g., an HTTP request), you’d need to use `await` and potentially `fakeAsync` and `tick()` to properly wait for the operation to complete before making the assertion.
