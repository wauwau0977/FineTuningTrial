For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/heating/HeatPumpDataService.java' with name 'HeatPumpDataService.java'... 
Consider the following method snippet:

```java
   @RequestMapping("/scanRegisters")
   @ResponseBody
   public List<String> scanRegisters(
           @RequestParam(name = "maxRegister", defaultValue = "510", required = false) int maxRegister) {
       return heatingDataReadService.scanAllRegisters(maxRegister);
   }
```

What is the purpose of this method?  What is the role of the `maxRegister` parameter? What potential security implications could arise from allowing a user to arbitrarily set this value, and how could this be mitigated?
