You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `MyRequestInterceptor`, acts as a Spring Web HandlerInterceptor to intercept incoming HTTP requests. It logs request details (path, session ID, client ID, client version, IP address, processing time, and HTTP status) and persists this information to a database via the `SessionRequestRepository`. It also measures request processing time. The class differentiates between requests to be persisted and those to be skipped based on the `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest()` method.  If an exception occurs during request processing, it's logged.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MyRequestInterceptor`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Intercept incoming HTTP requests, log request details, and save relevant request data to a database.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, `Object handler`, `Exception ex`.
    - **Outputs**: Log messages (using SLF4J), database persistence via `SessionRequestRepository`.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. `preHandle()`: Records the start time of the request and stores it as a request attribute.
    2. `afterCompletion()`:
        a. Retrieves the start time from the request attribute.
        b. Calculates the request processing time.
        c. Extracts request path, client ID, client version, and IP address from the request.
        d. Retrieves the session ID from a cookie.
        e. Checks if the request should be persisted using `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest()`.
        f. If the request is relevant:
            i. Creates a `SessionRequest` object with extracted data.
            ii. Saves the `SessionRequest` to the database using `sessionRequestRepository`.
            iii. Logs request details and total processing time.
        g. If the request is not relevant, logs the request URL.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Database: Interacts with the database through `SessionRequestRepository` to save request details.
    - Logging: Uses SLF4J for logging.
    - Cookie: Retrieves session ID from a cookie.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Exception Handling: Logs the exception message if an exception occurs during request processing.
    - Missing Cookie: Handles the case where the session cookie is not present by assigning a default value ("unknown") to the session ID.
    - Irrelevant Requests: Logs irrelevant requests without attempting to persist them.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The interceptor should add minimal overhead to request processing time. The logging and database persistence operations should be efficient.
- **Scalability**: The interceptor should be able to handle a large volume of requests without significant performance degradation. Database interactions need to be optimized for scalability.
- **Security**: The interceptor itself does not directly handle authentication or authorization. However, it relies on a secure cookie for session management.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively well-structured, with clear separation of concerns. Comments and logging statements enhance readability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The interceptor should be robust and handle exceptions gracefully. Database connectivity should be handled reliably.
- **Usability**: The interceptor is intended for internal use within the application. No direct user interaction is required.

## 5. Key Components

- **`preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)`**: Records the start time of the request.
- **`afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex)`**: Calculates processing time, extracts request details, and saves them to the database if the request is relevant.
- **`SessionRequest`**: A database entity representing request details.
- **`SessionRequestRepository`**: An interface for persisting `SessionRequest` entities to the database.
- **`MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)`**: A method determining if a request should be persisted.
- **Error Handling**: The `afterCompletion` method logs exception messages if an exception occurred.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:  Part of the `thserver` web module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: Utilizes basic data structures like Strings.
- Collections: Implicitly used within Spring Web framework.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Web**: Used for handling HTTP requests and interceptors.
- **SLF4J**: Used for logging.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Used to interact with the database via `SessionRequestRepository`.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.SessionRequestRepository`**:  Provides database access for `SessionRequest` entities.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.SessionRequest`**: Defines the structure of request data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Utils`**: Contains utility functions like `getRequestIP`.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.MySessionFilter`**:  Provides a method to determine if a request is relevant for persistence.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**: Consider asynchronous database persistence to avoid blocking the request thread. Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- **Code Readability**: Extract the creation of the `SessionRequest` object into a separate helper method.
- **Security Improvements**: Ensure that sensitive information is not logged or stored in plain text. Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently. Explore using a message queue for asynchronous database persistence to decouple the interceptor from the database. Consider horizontal scaling of the web application.
- **Configuration**: Externalize configuration parameters (e.g., logging levels, database connection details) to make the interceptor more flexible and configurable.
