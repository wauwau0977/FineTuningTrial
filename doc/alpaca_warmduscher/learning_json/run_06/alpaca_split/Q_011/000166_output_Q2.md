The `LocationStrategy` is an Angular interface that defines how the application gets and sets the current URL in the browser. It's essential for managing navigation and routing within the application.

The `HashLocationStrategy` implements a specific strategy for handling URLs. Instead of directly manipulating the path portion of the URL (e.g., `http://example.com/dashboard`), it uses the hash fragment (the part after the `#` symbol, e.g., `http://example.com/#/dashboard`).  

Here's a breakdown of the difference between `HashLocationStrategy` and `PathLocationStrategy`:

* **`PathLocationStrategy` (Default):** Uses the path portion of the URL. This is the standard way web applications handle routing.  It's cleaner and more SEO-friendly because it doesn't include the `#` symbol. However, it requires server-side configuration to handle direct navigation to these paths.  If you directly access `http://example.com/dashboard` on a server without proper configuration (e.g., using HTML5 history mode), the server will likely return a 404 error.

* **`HashLocationStrategy`:** Uses the hash fragment. This avoids the need for server-side configuration because the browser handles the routing entirely on the client-side.  The server sees only the part of the URL before the `#` and ignores everything after it.  However, it results in less aesthetically pleasing URLs and can have some SEO implications.

**When to choose one over the other:**

* **`PathLocationStrategy`:** Use this if you have control over the server configuration and can set up proper routing rules to handle direct navigation to the application's routes. This is generally the preferred approach for production applications.

* **`HashLocationStrategy`:** Use this if you don't have control over the server configuration (e.g., when deploying to a static hosting service) or if you need a simple, client-side routing solution that doesn't require any server-side changes.  Itâ€™s also useful for prototyping or development environments.

In this case, the code is explicitly choosing `HashLocationStrategy` likely because the application is intended to be deployed in an environment where server-side routing configuration isn't possible or practical.
