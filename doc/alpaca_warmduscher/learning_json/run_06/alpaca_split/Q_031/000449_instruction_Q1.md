For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts'... How does the `ofWebService()` method handle potentially missing data from the web service? What are the implications of this approach and could you suggest an alternative?
