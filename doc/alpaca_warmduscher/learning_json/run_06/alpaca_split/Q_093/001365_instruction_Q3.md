For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/DialogFlowWebhookController.java' with name 'DialogFlowWebhookController.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
text.setText(List.of("Boiler Temperatur ist "+heatPumpDataService.getCurrent().getBoilerTemp()));
