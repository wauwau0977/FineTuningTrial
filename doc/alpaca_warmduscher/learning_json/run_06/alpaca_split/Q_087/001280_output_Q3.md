The `@Component` annotation is a marker that indicates this class should be managed by the Spring application context. Itâ€™s a general form of stereotyping a class as a Spring component.  This means that Spring will automatically detect, instantiate, and manage this class as a bean.  Specifically, Spring's component scanning mechanism will find classes annotated with `@Component` (or more specialized annotations like `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`) and register them as beans in its application context.  This allows for dependency injection and other Spring features to be applied to instances of the `StartupData` class, enabling loose coupling and testability.  Without this annotation, Spring would not know about this class unless it was explicitly registered as a bean in a configuration file or through Java configuration.
