`org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` is a JUnit Jupiter annotation used to mark a method as a test method. The testing framework will automatically discover and execute methods annotated with `@Test`.  It signals that the annotated method contains a unit test that should be run during the test execution phase.

`org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest` is a Spring Boot annotation that configures the testing environment. It essentially loads the Spring application context. This means it starts a full Spring Boot application (or a sliced version of it, configurable through attributes) within the test environment.  This allows the test to interact with all the beans, services, and configurations defined in the application.  It provides integration-test-like capabilities by starting the Spring context.  Without this annotation, the test would not have access to the application's dependencies and configurations.  It effectively turns this into an integration test (though minimal in this example), rather than a pure unit test.
