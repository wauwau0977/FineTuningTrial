Using `async()` and `await TestBed.configureTestingModule(...)` (or the equivalent Promise-based approach) is crucial because `TestBed.configureTestingModule` returns a `Promise`. This Promise represents the asynchronous operation of setting up the testing module â€“ loading modules, resolving dependencies, and creating the testing environment.

If you removed the `await`, the code would proceed to create the component instance (`fixture = TestBed.createComponent(OverviewCurrentComponent);`) *before* the testing module was fully initialized. This could lead to several issues:

*   **Dependency Resolution Errors:** The component might depend on services or other components that haven't been properly initialized, resulting in runtime errors or incorrect behavior.
*   **Incomplete Configuration:** The testing environment might not be fully configured, leading to unexpected test results.
*   **Unreliable Tests:** The tests might pass or fail intermittently depending on the timing of the asynchronous operation.

Essentially, by awaiting the Promise returned by `TestBed.configureTestingModule`, you ensure that the testing environment is fully ready *before* you attempt to create and interact with the component, leading to more reliable and predictable tests.  The `fixture.detectChanges()` call then ensures that the view reflects the initial state of the configured component.
