Hardcoding `serviceBaseURL: "."` implies that the application expects the server to be running on the same host and port as the client application itself. This simplifies deployment in certain scenarios, like a single-server setup or local development, but presents several drawbacks in production.

Benefits: Simplifies initial deployment in straightforward setups, potentially reducing configuration overhead.

Drawbacks: It lacks flexibility; if the backend service moves to a different host or port, the client needs to be rebuilt and redeployed. It doesn't support load balancing or failover scenarios. It can introduce security risks if the base URL is sensitive.

Alternatives:
1.  **Environment Variables:** The preferred solution. Retrieve the `serviceBaseURL` from an environment variable during runtime. This allows configuration to be changed without code modification.
2.  **Configuration File:** Read the `serviceBaseURL` from a separate configuration file (e.g., a JSON file) loaded at runtime.
3.  **DNS-based Configuration:** Use a DNS record to point to the backend service, allowing the backend's address to be updated without client redeployment (more complex).
