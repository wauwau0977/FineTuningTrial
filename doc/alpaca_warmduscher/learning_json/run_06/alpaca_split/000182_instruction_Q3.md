For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.spec.ts' with name 'client-id.service.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
 beforeEach(() => {
   TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
   service = TestBed.inject(ClientIdService);
 });
```
What is the purpose of `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})` and `TestBed.inject(ClientIdService)` within the `beforeEach` block? Explain how these lines contribute to setting up the testing environment for the `ClientIdService`.
