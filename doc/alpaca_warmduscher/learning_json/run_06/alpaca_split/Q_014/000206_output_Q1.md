The 'should be created' test is extremely basic and only verifies that an instance of `HeatingDataService` can be successfully created. It provides almost no insight into the *behavior* of the service. It confirms *instantiation*, not *functionality*. 

To provide more comprehensive coverage, I would add at least the following tests:

1. **Test for Data Retrieval:** Assuming `HeatingDataService` fetches heating data from somewhere (API, local storage, etc.), I would write a test that mocks the data source (e.g., using `spyOn` and returning a predefined object) and verifies that the service correctly retrieves and returns the data. This would involve asserting the structure and values of the returned data.

2. **Test for Data Transformation/Calculation:** If the service performs any calculations or transformations on the heating data (e.g., converting units, calculating averages), I would write tests that provide specific input data and assert that the service returns the expected output. This tests the business logic within the service.

3. **Test for Error Handling:** If the service handles potential errors (e.g., API failures, invalid data), I would write tests that simulate error scenarios (e.g., mock the API to return an error response) and verify that the service handles the errors gracefully, either by returning a default value, logging the error, or throwing an appropriate exception. This would likely use `done()` in the `it()` block to handle asynchronous error propagation.

These additions would shift the test suite from a simple instantiation check to a meaningful verification of the service's functionality and reliability.
