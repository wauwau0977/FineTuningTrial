The `SessionRequestRepository` is a Spring Data repository interface, likely responsible for persisting and retrieving `SessionRequest` entities from a database. It's injected into `MvcConfig` via the constructor.

Within the class, the `sessionRequestRepository` is passed as a dependency to the `MyRequestInterceptor`. The interceptor likely uses this repository to access or modify `SessionRequest` data during request processing. This suggests that the interceptor is responsible for tasks such as tracking requests, potentially logging session information, or performing authorization checks based on data stored in the `SessionRequest` entities. The interceptor acts as a bridge to access and manipulate data related to session requests.
