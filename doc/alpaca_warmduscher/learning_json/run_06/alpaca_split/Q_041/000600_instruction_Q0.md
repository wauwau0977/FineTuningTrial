You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component, `OverviewCurrentComponent`, retrieves and displays current heating data and meteorological data. It periodically refreshes this data from a backend service and provides a shower recommendation based on the boiler temperature. It also listens for browser visibility changes to refresh data when the user returns to the application after it has been in the background.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `OverviewCurrentComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Retrieve current heating data.
    - Retrieve current meteorological data.
    - Retrieve historical meteorological data (currently incomplete).
    - Provide a shower recommendation based on boiler temperature.
    - Periodically refresh data from the backend.
    - Refresh data when the browser window becomes visible.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** None directly from the user. Data is fetched automatically.
    - **Outputs:** Displays current heating and meteorological data and provides a shower recommendation in the component's template (HTML).
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1.  `ngOnInit()`: Initiates the first data fetch when the component is initialized.
    2.  `myReload()`:
        - Calls `heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissCurrent()` to fetch current meteorological data.
        - Calls `heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissHistorical()` to fetch historical meteorological data.
        - Calls `heatingDataService.getCurrent()` to fetch current heating data.
    3.  A timer (`interval`) triggers `myReload()` periodically (every 30 seconds) if the data hasn't been refreshed recently.
    4.  `visibilitychange()` event listener triggers `myReload()` when the browser window becomes visible again.
    5.  `getShowerRecommendation()`:  Calculates a shower recommendation string based on the `boilerTemp` value. A series of `if/else if` statements determine the recommendation.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **API Calls:**
        - `heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissCurrent()`:  Fetches current meteorological data from a backend API.
        - `heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissHistorical()`: Fetches historical meteorological data from a backend API.
        - `heatingDataService.getCurrent()`: Fetches current heating data from a backend API.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - The component doesn't explicitly handle API errors (e.g., network failures, server errors).  Error handling is likely implemented within the `HeatingDataService`.
    - No specific handling for invalid or missing data from the API.
    - The recommendation logic assumes a numerical `boilerTemp` value; unexpected input could lead to incorrect recommendations.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - Data should be refreshed within a reasonable time frame (target under 5 seconds).
    - The component should not cause excessive CPU or memory usage.
- **Scalability:** The component itself is not directly scalable. Scalability depends on the backend services.
- **Security:** The component does not directly handle security concerns. Security depends on the backend services and data transmission protocols.
- **Maintainability:** The code is reasonably well-structured but could be improved by extracting the shower recommendation logic into a separate function or service.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The component's reliability depends on the availability of the backend services.
- **Usability:**  The component provides information in a human-readable format (shower recommendation).
- **Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements are apparent.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `ngOnInit()`: Initializes the component and fetches data.
    - `myReload()`: Fetches current heating and meteorological data.
    - `getShowerRecommendation()`: Generates a shower recommendation based on the boiler temperature.
    - `visibilitychange()`: Refreshes data when the browser window becomes visible.
- **Important logic flows:**
    - Periodic data refresh using `interval`.
    - Data refresh triggered by browser visibility change.
    - Shower recommendation logic based on `boilerTemp`.
- **Error handling:**  Error handling appears to be delegated to the `HeatingDataService`.
- **Classes:** Only the `OverviewCurrentComponent` class is defined in this file.
- **Modules:**  Uses Angular modules.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- TypeScript
- Observables (RxJS)
- Promises

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular:** Used for component structure, data binding, and routing.
- **RxJS:** Used for asynchronous data handling (Observables).
- **Moment.js:** Used for date and time manipulation.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`HeatingDataService`**: Provides access to heating and meteorological data from the backend.
- **`HeatingEntity`**: Data model for heating data.
- **`MeteoSwissEntity`**: Data model for meteorological data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:**
    - Implement caching of fetched data to reduce the load on the backend and improve responsiveness.
- **Code Readability:**
    - Extract the shower recommendation logic into a separate function or service to improve code organization and testability.
    - Consider using a more concise approach for the shower recommendation logic, such as a lookup table or a series of range checks.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Review the data transmission protocols used by the `HeatingDataService` to ensure data is securely transmitted.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Ensure the backend services are scalable to handle increased load.
    - Consider implementing a more robust caching strategy to further reduce the load on the backend.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to catch and handle API errors gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.
- **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the component, including the shower recommendation logic.
