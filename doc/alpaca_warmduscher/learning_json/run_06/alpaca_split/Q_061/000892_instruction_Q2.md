Consider the methods related to pump status: `getDi70PumpHk1()`, `getDi21PumpPrimary()`, `getDi22pumpLoad()`.  Assuming these return numerical values representing some kind of pump state (e.g., on/off, speed, load), what data type would be most suitable for these methods, and what are the trade-offs between different options (e.g., `Double`, `Integer`, `Boolean`)?
