For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.spec.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.spec.ts' we have the following question:

Describe, in detail, the purpose and functionality of the `beforeEach` block that executes *after* the asynchronous `TestBed.configureTestingModule` completes. Specifically, explain what each line within this block does, focusing on how the component and its fixture are initialized for testing.  Explain the significance of `fixture.detectChanges()`.
