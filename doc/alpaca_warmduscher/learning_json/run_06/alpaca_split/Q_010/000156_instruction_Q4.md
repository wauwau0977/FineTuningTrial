For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.ts' with name 'app.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the overall purpose and behavior of the `subscribe` property within the `AppComponent`. What does it accomplish, and how does it interact with the `interval` observable to achieve its functionality? Explain how the `val` parameter within the callback function is used (or not used) and what its significance is.
