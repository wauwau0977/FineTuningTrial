For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
this.cache[cacheKey] = loader().pipe(shareReplay(1));
```
Explain the purpose of `shareReplay(1)` in this line. What problem does it solve, and how does it contribute to the overall functionality of the `CacheService`?
