The `@Index` annotation creates a database index on the `measurementDate` column. A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table.  Without an index, the database would have to perform a full table scan to find rows matching a particular `measurementDate`, which is very slow for large tables.

This index dramatically speeds up queries that filter or sort by `measurementDate`.  For example, a query like "Find all heat pump readings from yesterday" would be significantly faster with this index.

A particularly beneficial scenario would be generating historical reports or time-series graphs of heat pump performance.  If the application frequently needs to retrieve data within specific date ranges (e.g., "Show the average boiler temperature for the past week"), the index on `measurementDate` will make these queries much more efficient, reducing response times and improving the overall user experience.
