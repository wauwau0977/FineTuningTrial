The `ReentrantLock` in this code is used to provide mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread can access and modify the `syncedObject` at any given time. This is crucial to prevent race conditions and data corruption when multiple threads are interacting with the shared resource.

Here's a breakdown of the problem it solves and the benefits of `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized`:

**Problem Solved:**

Without a lock, multiple threads could simultaneously access and modify `syncedObject`. This could lead to inconsistent data, incorrect results, and potentially crashes. The `ReentrantLock` ensures that a thread must acquire the lock before accessing `syncedObject`, and releases it when finished, preventing concurrent access.

**Benefits of `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized`:**

1.  **More Flexible Locking:** `ReentrantLock` offers more flexibility than `synchronized`.  `synchronized` is a keyword built into the Java language, while `ReentrantLock` is a class that provides a richer API.
2.  **TryLock:** `ReentrantLock` provides the `tryLock()` method, which allows a thread to attempt to acquire the lock without blocking.  This is useful for avoiding deadlocks or implementing timeouts.
3.  **Interruptible Lock Acquisition:** `ReentrantLock` allows a thread waiting for the lock to be interrupted.  `synchronized` does not support interruptible lock acquisition directly.
4.  **Fairness:** `ReentrantLock` can be constructed to be "fair," meaning that threads will acquire the lock in the order they requested it. While not always strictly enforced, this can reduce contention and improve performance.  `synchronized` does not guarantee fairness.
5.  **Lock Statistics:**  `ReentrantLock` provides methods for retrieving information about the lock, such as the number of threads currently waiting to acquire it. This can be useful for monitoring and debugging.
6. **Explicit Unlock:** With `ReentrantLock`, unlocking is explicit using `lock.unlock()`. This is good because you can be certain that the lock is released. While usually the JVM will release `synchronized` locks, it is possible to accidentally have a long held lock.

In this specific `GlobalSynced` class, the explicit control offered by `ReentrantLock` is particularly valuable, as it allows for more fine-grained control over lock acquisition and release, and potentially allows for features like fairness or interruptible lock acquisition if required in the future.
