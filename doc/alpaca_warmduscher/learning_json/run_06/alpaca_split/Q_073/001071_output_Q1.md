The `scanAllRegisters` method, as implemented, can create several issues due to its indiscriminate reading of all registers up to `maxRegister`:

*   **Performance Impact:** Reading all registers, even those that aren’t used or relevant, is inefficient and can significantly slow down the data acquisition process, especially with a large `maxRegister` value. It adds unnecessary network traffic and processing overhead.
*   **Network Congestion/Timeouts:**  Sending a large number of Modbus requests can potentially overwhelm the Modbus device or the network, leading to timeouts or communication errors.
*   **Data Interpretation Complexity:** The method returns all register values as strings, making it difficult to analyze or process the data programmatically. Identifying the meaningful registers requires manual effort or additional parsing logic.
*   **Robustness Issues:** If any single register read fails, the entire scan operation could be interrupted or return incomplete data.
*   **Lack of Filtering:** The method doesn't provide any filtering mechanism to select specific registers of interest.

Here's how the method could be improved:

1.  **Selective Reading:** Instead of reading all registers, maintain a configuration list of the registers that are actually used or monitored.  Only read those registers.
2.  **Batch Reading:**  Utilize Modbus’s ability to read multiple registers in a single request. This reduces the number of requests and improves efficiency.
3.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle register read failures. Log errors and potentially retry failed reads.
4.  **Data Structure:** Return the register values in a more structured format, such as a `Map` or a custom data structure, making it easier to process the data programmatically.
5.  **Timeout Configuration:** Configure appropriate timeouts for register reads to prevent the scan operation from hanging indefinitely.
6.  **Asynchronous Operation:** Consider performing the scan operation asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
7.  **Configuration-Driven:** Make the list of registers to scan configurable (e.g., through a configuration file or database) to allow for flexibility and adaptation to different Modbus devices.
