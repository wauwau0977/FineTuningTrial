Excluding specific events from Zone.js patching can offer performance benefits, particularly for events that fire frequently (like `scroll` and `mousemove`).  Zone.js patching introduces overhead, as it intercepts and wraps event handlers to facilitate change detection. For high-frequency events, this overhead can become significant, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks or jankiness in the UI. By excluding these events, the application can bypass this overhead and improve responsiveness.

However, a developer must carefully consider the implications before excluding events.  Zone.js patching is essential for Angular's change detection mechanism. If an event is crucial for triggering updates in the application's UI, excluding it from patching will break change detection and the UI will not update correctly. 

Specifically, the developer needs to ensure that any changes related to those excluded events are handled manually or through other means that *do* trigger change detection. They must thoroughly test the application to verify that excluding the event does not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior. It's also important to weigh the performance gain against the potential loss of functionality or the increased complexity of manually handling change detection.
