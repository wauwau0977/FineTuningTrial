The `AppRoutingModule` class defines the application's routing configuration.

The `routes` constant is an array of `Routes` objects, which in this specific instance is empty (`[]`). This signifies that the application currently has no defined routes. Each `Route` object would typically contain a path and a component to be rendered when that path is accessed.

`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` is used to initialize the Angular router with the defined routes. The `forRoot()` method creates a router module configured with the provided `routes` array. This is a static method, meaning it's only called once when the application starts.

The `imports` array within the `@NgModule` decorator lists the modules that this module depends on. In this case, `[RouterModule.forRoot(routes)]` imports the configured router module, making the routing functionality available within this module.

The `exports` array lists the modules or components that this module makes available to other modules.  `[RouterModule]` exports the configured router module, making it available for use throughout the entire application, allowing components to utilize routing functionalities like `routerLink` and `router-outlet`.  Without exporting the `RouterModule`, other modules wouldnâ€™t be able to access its features.
