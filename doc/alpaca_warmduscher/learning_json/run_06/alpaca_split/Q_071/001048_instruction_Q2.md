For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/HeatingDataReadService.java' with name 'HeatingDataReadService.java'...
The interface defines three methods: `init()`, `getData()`, and `scanAllRegisters()`. Considering a multi-threaded environment, what potential thread-safety issues could arise within an implementation of this interface, and how would you address them using appropriate synchronization mechanisms? Be specific about which methods might require synchronization and why.
