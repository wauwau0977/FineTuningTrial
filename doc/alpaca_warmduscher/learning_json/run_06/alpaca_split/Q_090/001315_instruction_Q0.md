You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class, `MvcConfig`, configures Spring MVC interceptors within the 'Warmduscher' application. Specifically, it registers a custom interceptor, `MyRequestInterceptor`, to handle incoming web requests. The interceptor leverages a `SessionRequestRepository` to potentially manage or log session-related requests.  It's designed to be a configuration component within a Spring Boot application and avoids overriding application properties by explicitly omitting the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MvcConfig.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MvcConfig`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Configure Spring MVC interceptors by registering `MyRequestInterceptor`.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This class does not directly handle user inputs or outputs. It operates internally within the Spring MVC framework.  The output is the configuration of the interceptor registry.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `MvcConfig` class is initialized with a `SessionRequestRepository` dependency through its constructor.
    2. The `addInterceptors` method is called by Spring during application startup.
    3. The method registers `MyRequestInterceptor` with the `InterceptorRegistry`.  This ensures that the interceptor is invoked for all incoming requests.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interacts with the Spring MVC framework's `InterceptorRegistry`.
    - Utilizes a `SessionRequestRepository` (presumably a database access object) to perform operations related to session requests.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  
    - The class implicitly handles the case where `SessionRequestRepository` is not properly initialized by throwing a `NullPointerException` during object creation if it is null. 
    - The absence of `@EnableWebMvc` avoids potential conflicts with existing application configurations.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  Interceptor registration is a one-time operation during application startup, so performance impact is minimal.
- **Scalability**: The interceptor registration itself doesn’t directly affect scalability. Scalability depends on the implementation of `MyRequestInterceptor` and `SessionRequestRepository`.
- **Security**: The class itself doesn't implement security features. Security is the responsibility of `MyRequestInterceptor` and how it utilizes `SessionRequestRepository`.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.  The use of dependency injection promotes modularity.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class is reliable as long as the `SessionRequestRepository` dependency is correctly configured and available.
- **Usability**: The class is intended for internal use within the application and doesn’t have a direct user interface.
- **Compliance**: N/A

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `MvcConfig()`: Constructor that initializes the `sessionRequestRepository` dependency.
    - `addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry)`:  Overrides the `addInterceptors` method from `WebMvcConfigurer` to register the `MyRequestInterceptor`.
- **Important Logic Flows**:  The main logic flow is the registration of the interceptor during application startup.
- **Error Handling**:  Implicitly handles null `SessionRequestRepository` via constructor.
- **Classes**:  No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: Part of the `thserver` module related to web configuration.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures: N/A
- File handling: N/A
- Concurrency/threading: N/A

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Boot**: Used for auto-configuration, dependency injection, and overall application framework.
- **Spring MVC**: Used for web request handling and interceptor registration.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.SessionRequestRepository`**:  An interface or class responsible for managing or accessing session request data.  It's likely a database access object.
- **`MyRequestInterceptor`**: A custom interceptor class, not defined in this file, that is registered to handle incoming requests.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** N/A – The class performs a simple configuration task.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Ensure that `MyRequestInterceptor` and the interactions with `SessionRequestRepository` are secured against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, cross-site scripting).
- **Scalability Considerations:**  The scalability of this component depends on the implementation of `MyRequestInterceptor` and how it handles concurrent requests. Consider caching or asynchronous processing within `MyRequestInterceptor` if needed.  The `SessionRequestRepository` should also be designed to scale appropriately (e.g., using a connection pool, database sharding).
