For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass' with name 'overview-current.component.sass'... How might you approach refactoring the use of `::ng-deep` in this file to align with modern Angular best practices for component styling?
