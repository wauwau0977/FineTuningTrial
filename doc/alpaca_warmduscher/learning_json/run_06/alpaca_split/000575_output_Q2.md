The class `.spacer margin-bottom: 15px` defines a class that adds a bottom margin of 15 pixels to any element it's applied to.

This class would be particularly useful as a vertical separator between sections or blocks of content within the `overview-current` component's UI. Imagine a dashboard-like layout with different cards or panels displaying various data points (boiler temperature, hot water level, etc.). Applying `.spacer` after each card or panel would create consistent vertical spacing, preventing elements from appearing too crowded or visually colliding.

It helps maintain a consistent and clean UI design by:

*   **Standardizing Vertical Rhythm:**  It establishes a consistent spacing unit (15px) for vertical separation, making the layout more visually harmonious.
*   **Improving Readability:** Sufficient vertical spacing makes it easier for the user to scan and understand the different sections of information.
*   **Reducing Visual Clutter:**  By providing clear separation between elements, it reduces visual clutter and makes the UI more visually appealing.
*   **Facilitating Future Changes:** If the desired vertical spacing needs to be adjusted, you only need to change the value in the `.spacer` class definition, rather than modifying the margin of multiple individual elements.
