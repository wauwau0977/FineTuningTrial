Beyond increasing the heap size (which has limitations and is not always the best solution), several strategies could be implemented to mitigate the impact of caching on application performance and stability under increased load:

1.  **Choose a Distributed Cache:** Replace `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` with a distributed cache like Redis or Hazelcast. This offloads the caching responsibility from the JVM heap to a separate infrastructure, allowing for significantly larger cache sizes and improved scalability.

2.  **Implement Cache Eviction Policies:** Configure eviction policies (e.g., LRU, FIFO, LFU) within the `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` (or the chosen distributed cache).  This ensures that the least frequently or recently used data is removed from the cache when it reaches capacity, preventing excessive memory usage.

3.  **Set Appropriate Time-to-Live (TTL) Values:**  Carefully configure TTL values for cached data. Shorter TTLs reduce memory consumption but increase the cache miss rate. Longer TTLs reduce the cache miss rate but increase memory consumption.  A balance must be struck based on the data's volatility and the application's requirements.

4.  **Cache Partitioning:** If using a distributed cache, partition the cache based on logical keys. This distributes the load across multiple cache servers and improves scalability.

5.  **Cache-Aside Pattern:** Implement the Cache-Aside pattern, where the application first checks the cache, and if the data is not found, retrieves it from the database and populates the cache. This reduces the load on the database but requires careful handling of cache consistency.

6.  **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a cache invalidation strategy to remove stale data from the cache when the underlying data changes in the database. This ensures that the cache contains only valid data and prevents inconsistencies.

7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring to track cache hit rate, cache size, and memory usage.  Set up alerts to notify administrators when the cache is approaching its capacity or when the hit rate is dropping, allowing for proactive intervention.

8. **Implement a tiered caching strategy:** Consider adding a level of caching closer to the user (e.g. CDN) and another at the application level. This offloads requests and can significantly reduce load.
