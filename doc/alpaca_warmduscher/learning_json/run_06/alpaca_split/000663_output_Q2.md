Extending this class to support additional profiles like "staging" is straightforward, but requires careful consideration to maintain clean and extensible code. Here's what Iâ€™d consider:

*   **Naming Convention:**  Establish a consistent naming convention for profile strings.  Using all lowercase with underscores (e.g., `STAGING`, `PRODUCTION`) is a good approach.
*   **Avoid Magic Strings:**  While these are constants, avoid directly embedding profile names throughout the application. Ideally, a central configuration mechanism should be used to manage these values, potentially reading them from environment variables or a configuration file. This prevents hardcoded dependencies and makes it easier to switch profiles without code changes.
*   **Enum Consideration:** If the number of profiles is limited and well-defined, consider replacing the static final strings with an `enum`. This provides type safety and improved code readability.
*   **Configuration Management:** The application should be designed to use a configuration object or service that reads the active profile. This decouples the application logic from the specific profile name and simplifies testing.
*   **Profile-Specific Logic:** If a profile requires significant changes in application behavior, consider using a strategy pattern or dependency injection to load different components or implementations based on the active profile.
*   **Documentation:** Clearly document each profile and its purpose. This is crucial for maintainability and collaboration.

Example with enum and configuration:

```java
public class Profiles {
    public enum Profile {
        DEFAULT,
        SENSOR_MOCK,
        STAGING
    }

    private static Profile currentProfile = Profile.DEFAULT;

    public static void setCurrentProfile(Profile profile) {
        currentProfile = profile;
    }

    public static Profile getCurrentProfile() {
        return currentProfile;
    }
}
```
