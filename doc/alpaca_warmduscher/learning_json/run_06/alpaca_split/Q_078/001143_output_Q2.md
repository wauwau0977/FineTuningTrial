Extending `RuntimeException` makes `ThException` an unchecked exception. This means calling code is *not* required to catch or declare it in their `throws` clause. This is advantageous when the exception represents a programming error or a condition that should realistically *never* happen in a properly functioning application (e.g., null pointer dereference, logic error).  It allows for cleaner code in the happy path, as developers don’t need to clutter their code with `try-catch` blocks for conditions they assume won’t occur. It signals to the caller that the error likely indicates a bug in *their* code, or in some foundational aspect of the system.

Extending `Exception` would make `ThException` a checked exception.  This *forces* calling code to either `catch` the exception or declare it in their `throws` clause. This is appropriate for conditions that are reasonably foreseeable during normal operation and which the calling code might be able to recover from (e.g., network timeout, file not found).  It makes the caller explicitly acknowledge and handle potential failures.  

In 'Warmduscher', choosing `RuntimeException` suggests the intent is that the exception usually indicates an unrecoverable programming error or a systemic problem, simplifying error handling for common, non-exceptional cases.  If we expected sensor communication failures or other recoverable operational issues to routinely trigger this exception, then extending `Exception` would be more appropriate to enforce handling.
