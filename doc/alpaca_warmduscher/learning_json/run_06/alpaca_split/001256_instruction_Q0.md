You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a Spring Application Run Listener (`MyStartUpListener`) that captures the application startup time and stores it within a `StartupData` bean. This information can be used for monitoring and performance analysis. The listener registers itself via a Spring Factory configuration file.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MyStartUpListener`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Capture and store application startup time.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  The code doesn't directly handle user inputs/outputs. It receives the `ConfigurableApplicationContext` and `Duration` from the Spring Boot framework during application startup.  It outputs the startup time as a value set in the `StartupData` bean.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The Spring Boot framework instantiates `MyStartUpListener` during application startup.
    2. The `ready()` method is invoked by the framework after the application context is ready.
    3. The `ready()` method retrieves a `StartupData` bean from the application context.
    4. The startup time (provided as a `Duration` object) is converted to milliseconds.
    5. The milliseconds value is set as the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` property of the `StartupData` bean.
- **External Interactions:**  Interaction with the Spring application context to retrieve a bean.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**  No specific edge case handling is implemented within this class. If `StartupData` is not found in the context, a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` will be thrown by Spring.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  Minimal overhead. The code execution should be very fast as it only involves retrieving a bean, converting a duration, and setting a value.
- **Scalability:**  The listener has no impact on application scalability.
- **Security:**  No security concerns related to this class.
- **Maintainability:**  The code is simple and easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  Highly reliable. Failure of this component doesnâ€™t impact application availability. If the StartupData bean is not initialized correctly it could cause an error later when the data is retrieved.
- **Usability:**  Easy to integrate. Requires a Spring Factory configuration to register the listener.
- **Compliance:**  No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`MyStartUpListener` Class:** Implements `SpringApplicationRunListener` and captures the application startup time.
- **`ready()` Method:** This method is the entry point for capturing the startup time after the application context is ready.
- **`StartupData` Bean:**  An external bean used to store the captured startup time.  This class is not defined within the provided code snippet.
- **Error Handling:** No explicit error handling.  Spring's dependency injection handles the case where `StartupData` is not found.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Java 8+ (assumed, based on the use of `Duration`)
- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, interfaces)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Boot:** Used for application startup and dependency injection.
- **Spring Framework:** Provides the core functionality for managing the application context.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`StartupData`:**  A bean within the application context that stores the startup time.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling:**  Add explicit error handling in case the `StartupData` bean is not found in the application context. This would improve robustness.
- **Logging:**  Add logging to record the captured startup time for easier monitoring and debugging.
- **Configuration:**  Make the behavior of the listener configurable (e.g., allow disabling the capture of the startup time).
- **Metrics Integration:** Integrate with a metrics collection system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to expose the startup time as a metric.
