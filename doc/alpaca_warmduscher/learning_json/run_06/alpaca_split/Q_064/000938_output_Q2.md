Using getter methods like `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()`, `getDayOfWeekText()`, etc., instead of directly accessing the fields offers several benefits:

*   **Encapsulation:** Getters enforce encapsulation, hiding the internal implementation details of how the data is stored. This allows you to change the internal representation later without breaking client code that uses the interface.
*   **Data Transformation/Validation:**  Within the getter methods, you can add logic to transform or validate the data before returning it. For example, you could format a date, apply business rules, or handle null values.
*   **Read-Only Access:**  You can control access to the data. If a field should be read-only, the getter can be public, and the corresponding setter can be omitted.
*   **Future-Proofing:**  If you need to add logging, caching, or other cross-cutting concerns, you can easily add them to the getter methods without modifying the client code.
*   **Maintainability:** Getter methods improve code readability and maintainability by providing a clear and consistent way to access the data.
