For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.spec.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.spec.ts'... 
This test suite is minimal.  Assume that `BoilerChartComponent` receives input via an `@Input()` property called `data`. How would you modify this test suite to verify that the component correctly displays the input `data`? Provide a conceptual outline of the steps involved, *without* writing complete code, focusing on the key actions and assertions.
