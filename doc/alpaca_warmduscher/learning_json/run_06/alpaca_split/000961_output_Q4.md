The `BoilerStatsByHour` interface defines a contract for representing hourly statistics related to a boiler. It's designed to encapsulate aggregated data for analysis and reporting.

Here's a breakdown of each method:

*   `Integer getHourOfTheDay()`:  This method returns an integer representing the hour of the day (0-23) for which the statistics apply.  It serves as the primary key or identifier for the hourly data.

*   `Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()`: This method returns a double representing the sum of all decreases in boiler temperature difference during that hour. This could be used to analyze heat loss or cooling patterns.

*   `Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`:  This method returns a double representing the sum of all increases in boiler temperature difference during that hour.  This indicates heating activity.

*   `Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`: This method returns a long representing the total number of statistic records that contributed to the aggregated data for this hour. This is useful for determining the reliability or significance of the aggregated values (e.g., a small number of records might indicate the data is less representative).

The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation specifies the order in which the properties (methods' return values when serialized) should appear in the JSON representation of an object implementing this interface.  In this case, the JSON output will always have the fields in the order: "hourOfTheDay", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", and "numOfStatisticRecords1". This is beneficial for consistent API responses and simplifies parsing on the client side.  It doesn't affect the runtime behavior but controls the serialization format.
