Using `Long` instead of `Integer` for `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()` suggests that the number of statistic records could potentially exceed the maximum value that an `Integer` can hold (2,147,483,647).

A scenario that would necessitate a `Long` would be if the system tracks statistics over a long period of time or handles a very large number of boilers. For example, if the system collects data daily for several years, or if it monitors thousands of boilers, the total number of records could easily exceed the maximum `Integer` value.  Using `Long` (which can hold values up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) provides sufficient headroom to accommodate a much larger number of records without the risk of overflow errors.  This is a preemptive measure to ensure the application remains stable and accurate even as the data volume grows.
