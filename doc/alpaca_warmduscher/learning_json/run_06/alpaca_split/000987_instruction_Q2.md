For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java' with name 'AuditLogEntity.java'... 
Consider the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. What is the purpose of overriding these methods in a JPA entity, and what principle guides the implementation shown here (i.e., `return id != null ? id.equals(that.id) : that.id == null;`)? What potential issues could arise if these methods were not implemented correctly?
