The `ofWebService` method is designed to create a `HeatingEntity` object from data received from a web service. It acts as a factory method, taking the web service data (`data`) as input and transforming it into a properly formatted `HeatingEntity` instance.

It handles potentially missing data by checking if `data` is null. If `data` is null, it returns an empty instance of `HeatingEntity` created by calling `this.emptyInstance()`, preventing errors that would occur if you tried to access properties of a null object.

`HeatingDataService.convertDate(data.measurementDate)` is responsible for converting the `measurementDate` received from the web service (likely a string or timestamp format) into a JavaScript `Date` object. This ensures that the `measurementDate` property of the `HeatingEntity` is a proper `Date` object, allowing for date-related operations to be performed on it. This conversion step is important for handling different date formats that might be returned by the web service.
