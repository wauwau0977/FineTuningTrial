I would leverage environment variables and potentially a configuration management tool. Currently, the file suggests using `fileReplacements` in `angular.json`, which is a good start, but it doesn’t handle sensitive data securely.

My approach would involve:

1.  **Environment Variables:**  Define environment-specific configurations (like `serviceBaseURL`, API keys, etc.) as environment variables on the build server and/or client machines.  These variables wouldn’t be hardcoded in the source.
2.  **Build-time Replacement:** During the build process (using a tool like webpack or the Angular CLI), read these environment variables and replace placeholder values in the `environment.ts` file.  For example, I’d have something like `serviceBaseURL: process.env.API_URL`.  This ensures sensitive data isn’t committed to the repository.
3.  **Configuration Management (Optional):** For more complex setups or teams, I'd consider a configuration management tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. These tools securely store and manage sensitive information, providing better access control and auditing. The build process would then fetch configuration from these tools.

**Benefits:**

*   **Security:**  Sensitive information is not committed to the code repository.
*   **Flexibility:** Easily switch between environments without modifying the code.
*   **Maintainability:**  Centralized configuration management simplifies updates and changes.
*   **Scalability:** Supports complex environments and larger teams.
