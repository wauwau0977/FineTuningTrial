The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation, provided by the Jackson library, controls the order in which the properties of this interface are serialized into JSON. Without this annotation, Jackson would serialize the properties in the order they are declared in the interface (which isn't guaranteed or consistent). By specifying `{"dayOfWeekStartingMonday", "dayOfWeekText", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", "numOfStatisticRecords1"}`, we ensure that the JSON output will always have these properties in that specific order. This is useful for consistency in APIs, readability, and potentially compatibility with systems that rely on a specific JSON structure. It doesn't affect the data itself, only how it's presented when converted to JSON.
