The `@Repository` annotation is a Spring stereotype annotation that marks the interface as a data access component.  Its primary purpose is to enable Spring’s infrastructure to automatically detect and manage this component.  Specifically:

1.  **Component Scanning:** It enables Spring's component scanning mechanism to automatically discover and register the interface as a bean in the Spring application context.
2.  **Exception Translation:**  It translates exceptions that occur during data access operations into more generic Spring Data AccessExceptions. This simplifies error handling and provides a consistent exception hierarchy.
3.  **Dependency Injection:**  Allows Spring to inject dependencies into the interface (though less common with interfaces themselves; it applies to any concrete implementations).

While not strictly *required* for functionality in this simple case (as CrudRepository handles the underlying logic), it’s best practice to use `@Repository` (or other appropriate Spring stereotypes) to improve code clarity, maintainability, and to leverage Spring's features.
