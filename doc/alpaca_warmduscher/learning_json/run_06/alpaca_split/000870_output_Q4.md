The `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method retrieves aggregated MeteoSwiss statistics within a specified date range, grouping the data into fixed time intervals. 

Here's a breakdown of the method's functionality and the native SQL query:

**Purpose:**

The method aims to provide statistical summaries (average, min, max temperature and wind gust speed) of weather data, aggregated over fixed time intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds) within a given date range. This allows for analyzing trends and patterns in weather data at a more granular level than simply aggregating over the entire date range.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Input Parameters:**
    *   `measurement_date_start`: The start date of the desired date range.
    *   `measurement_date_end`: The end date of the desired date range.
    *   `groupEveryNthSecond`:  This parameter defines the size of the time interval for grouping. The data will be grouped into intervals of this many seconds.

2.  **Native SQL Query Breakdown:**
    *   **Inner Query:** The core of the query lies in the inner query that selects data from the `meteo_swiss` table.
        *   `round(extract(epoch from temperature_measure_date) / :group_every_nth_second)`: This is the key to the fixed interval grouping. `extract(epoch from temperature_measure_date)` extracts the number of seconds since the epoch for each `temperature_measure_date`.  This value is then divided by `groupEveryNthSecond`. The `round()` function truncates the result to the nearest integer, effectively grouping measurements that fall within the same `groupEveryNthSecon` interval into the same group. The result is assigned to the alias `groupid`.
        *   `t.*`:  Selects all columns from the `meteo_swiss` table.
        *   `where t.temperature_measure_date > :measurement_date_start and t.temperature_measure_date < :measurement_date_end`: Filters the data to include only measurements within the specified date range.
    *   **Outer Query:**
        *   `group by groupid, station_id`: Groups the results of the inner query by the calculated `groupid` and the `station_id`. This is crucial for calculating the statistics within each time interval for each station.
        *   `avg(temperature), min(temperature), max(temperature), avg(wind_gust_speed), min(wind_gust_speed), max(wind_gust_speed)`:  These aggregate functions calculate the average, minimum, and maximum values for temperature and wind gust speed within each group (i.e., for each station in each time interval).
        *   `order by temperature_measure_date desc`: Sorts the final results in descending order of `temperature_measure_date`, providing the most recent statistics first.

**In essence, the method efficiently groups weather measurements into fixed time intervals, allowing for the calculation of statistical summaries for each station within those intervals.** The `group_every_nth_second` parameter provides a flexible way to control the granularity of the analysis.
