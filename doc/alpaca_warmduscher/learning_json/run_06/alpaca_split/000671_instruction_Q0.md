You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java application, `ThserverApplication`, serves as the main entry point and configuration for a temperature/humidity sensor data processing server (part of the 'Warmduscher' project). It initializes Spring Boot, sets the default timezone, and logs key startup information (startup times, memory usage, server information) to an audit log after the application is fully initialized. It leverages scheduled tasks to ensure logging happens *after* full initialization.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplication.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `ThserverApplication`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Initializes a Spring Boot application.
    - Sets the default timezone to "Europe/Zurich".
    - Logs server startup details to an audit log after initialization.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** None directly from a user. Receives configurations via Spring Boot mechanisms.
    - **Outputs:**  Logs server startup information to an audit log database.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `main` method sets the default timezone.
    2. Spring Boot initializes the application context.
    3. After initialization is complete, the `@Scheduled` task `logStartup` is executed.
    4. `logStartup` collects startup details (startup times, memory information, server information).
    5. The collected details are converted to JSON.
    6. An `AuditLogEntity` is created with the appropriate metadata and the JSON data.
    7. The `AuditLogEntity` is saved to the audit log database via the `AuditLogRepository`.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Database Interaction:**  Uses `AuditLogRepository` to persist audit log data.
    - **Internal Component Interaction:** Relies on injected dependencies (`AuditLogRepository`, `InfoBean`, `StartupData`).
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    -  The `@Scheduled` task with `initialDelay` and `fixedDelay` ensures that the logStartup method is executed only once after full application initialization, even if multiple scheduled invocations are triggered.  

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The logging process should not significantly impact application performance. The `initialDelay` and `fixedDelay` configuration of the `@Scheduled` task minimizes the impact by deferring logging until after full initialization.
- **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a moderate number of startup logs without performance degradation.  Scalability of the database (audit log storage) is a separate concern.
- **Security:**  The audit logs may contain sensitive information, so database access should be secured.
- **Maintainability:**  The code is relatively simple and well-structured. Dependency injection promotes modularity.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The application should reliably log startup information unless there's a critical failure during database interaction.
- **Usability:** The application is primarily an internal component and does not have a direct user interface.  
- **Compliance:** Dependent on the audit log retention policies of the organization.

## 5. Key Components

- **`ThserverApplication` Class:** The main entry point of the application.
- **`main` Method:** Initializes Spring Boot and sets the default timezone.
- **`logStartup` Method:**  A scheduled task that collects and logs startup details.
- **`AuditLogRepository` Interface:** Provides an abstraction for interacting with the audit log database.
- **`InfoBean` Class:** Holds server information.
- **`StartupData` Class:** Holds startup time data.
- **`MemoryInfo` Class:** Provides current memory information.
- **`AuditLogEntity` Class:** Represents a single audit log entry.
- **Important logic flows:** The main logic flow revolves around the Spring Boot initialization and the scheduled `logStartup` task execution.
- **Error handling:** Primarily handled by Spring Boot's exception handling mechanisms and any error handling within the database interaction (through `AuditLogRepository`).
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined within this code.
- **Modules:** The code can be considered a module responsible for application startup and audit logging.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Java 8 or higher:** Required for the `@Scheduled` annotation and other modern Java features.
- **Data structures:** Uses `Map` and `TreeMap`.
- **String Manipulation:** Uses `Utils.toJSON()` for converting data to JSON.
- **Timezone handling:** Uses `TimeZone.setDefault()`.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Boot:** Used for application bootstrapping, dependency injection, and configuration.
- **SLF4J:** Used for logging.
- **Spring Scheduling:** Provides the `@Scheduled` annotation for task scheduling.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.audit.AuditLogRepository`:**  Interface for accessing and persisting audit log data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.audit.AuditLogEntity`:** Data model for audit log entries.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.device.service.HeatingDataReadService`**: Dependency injected but unused in this particular class.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Utils`**: Contains utility methods such as `toJSON`.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.spring.StartupData`**: Holds startup time information.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.InfoBean`**: Holds server information.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.MemoryInfo`**: Provides current memory information.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Investigate more efficient JSON serialization libraries if `Utils.toJSON()` becomes a bottleneck.
- **Code Readability:** The code is generally readable, but consider adding more descriptive comments, especially for complex logic.
- **Security Improvements:** Ensure proper database access controls and consider encrypting sensitive data within the audit logs.
- **Scalability Considerations:** If the audit log grows rapidly, consider using a dedicated audit logging solution or implementing log rotation and archiving.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling around the database interaction within the `logStartup` method, with logging of any exceptions.  Consider a retry mechanism for transient database errors.
- **Configuration:** Externalize the default timezone and other configuration parameters to allow for easier customization.
