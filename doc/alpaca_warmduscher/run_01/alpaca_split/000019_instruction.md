You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a REST endpoint for sending emails. It receives a subject and content via HTTP request parameters, then utilizes a `MailSend` utility class to construct and send the email. The endpoint returns a string indicating the result of the email sending operation. This functionality is intended to be used for sending alerts, notifications, or reports from the Warmduscher system (likely related to temperature sensor data given the project name).

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/email/EmailService.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `EmailService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code provides a REST API endpoint for sending emails.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:**
        - `subject` (String): The email subject (default: "Test from raspberry").
        - `content` (String): The email content (default: "This is a test only").
    - **Output:**
        - String: The result of the `mailSend.send()` operation.  This likely indicates success or failure and potentially an error message.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Receives HTTP request to `/email/send` endpoint.
    2. Extracts `subject` and `content` from request parameters. Uses default values if not provided.
    3. Calls the `mailSend.send(subject, content)` method.
    4. Returns the string result returned by `mailSend.send()`.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interacts with the `MailSend` utility class to send emails. This implies external interaction with an SMTP server (not directly visible in this code, but assumed).
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - The code handles missing request parameters by using default values for `subject` and `content`.
    - Error handling within the `mailSend.send()` method is not visible in this code. The returned string from `mailSend.send()` should indicate potential errors.  Further investigation of the `MailSend` class is needed to determine the comprehensive error handling strategy.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The response time should be reasonably fast, ideally within a few seconds, as itâ€™s an API endpoint. The execution time is dependent on the SMTP server's responsiveness and network conditions.
- **Scalability**: The scalability depends on the `MailSend` implementation and the underlying SMTP server.  The current code doesn't include any inherent scalability mechanisms.
- **Security**:  The code itself doesn't handle authentication or encryption. Security relies on the `MailSend` implementation and the configuration of the SMTP server. Sensitive information like SMTP credentials should not be hardcoded and should be managed securely.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.  The dependency injection of `MailSend` promotes modularity and testability.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  Reliability and availability depend on the `MailSend` implementation and the SMTP server.
- **Usability**: The API is straightforward to use, accepting two parameters for subject and content.
- **Compliance**: Compliance depends on the email sending policies and regulations (e.g., GDPR) and the configuration of the SMTP server.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `send(String subject, String content)`:  This is the main entry point of the service. It receives the email subject and content, and sends the email using the injected `MailSend` instance.
- **Important Logic Flows**: The logic flow is straightforward: receive parameters, call `MailSend`, return the result.
- **Error Handling**:  Error handling is delegated to the `MailSend` class.
- **Classes**:  `EmailService` is a Spring `@Controller` that handles the email sending request. No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: This code snippet represents a single module responsible for handling email sending requests.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures (Strings)
- Input/Output operations (through Spring Framework)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection (`@Controller`, constructor injection) and handling web requests (`@RequestMapping`, `@RequestParam`, `@ResponseBody`).
- **(Assumed) SMTP library within MailSend**: The `MailSend` class likely uses a Java SMTP library (e.g., JavaMail) for sending emails.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.MailSend`**: A utility class responsible for the actual email sending process. This is a key dependency.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments**: Asynchronous email sending could improve responsiveness by offloading the email sending process to a separate thread or message queue.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already reasonably readable.
- **Security Improvements**:  Implement proper authentication and encryption for SMTP communication. Ensure that sensitive credentials are not hardcoded and are managed securely (e.g., using environment variables or a configuration management system).  Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  Implement a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple the email sending process from the web application, allowing for scaling of the email sending service independently.  Implement connection pooling for SMTP connections.
- **Error Handling**:  Add more robust error handling within the `EmailService` to catch exceptions thrown by `MailSend` and return meaningful error messages to the client.  Log errors for debugging and monitoring.
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track email sending requests, responses, and errors.
