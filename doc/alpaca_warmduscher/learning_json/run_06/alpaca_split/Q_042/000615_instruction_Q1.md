For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts' with name 'environment.prod.ts'...
The `buildTimestampClient` constant contains a version string ("v01-20220220-093352"). What is the likely purpose of including this information in the production environment configuration, and how could a developer utilize this value within the application?
