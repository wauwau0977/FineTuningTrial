For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java' with name 'MyStartUpListener.java'...
This listener is designed to capture startup time. Imagine a scenario where you want to extend this listener to also log a specific application version during startup.  How would you approach modifying the existing `ready()` method to achieve this, assuming the application version is available as a string in a system property named `app.version`?
