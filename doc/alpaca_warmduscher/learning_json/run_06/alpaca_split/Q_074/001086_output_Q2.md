The `encodeUnicodeStringToBase58String` and `decodeBase58ToUnicodeString` methods provide a way to encode and decode Unicode strings using the base58 encoding scheme. They act as a wrapper around the core `encode` and `decode` methods, specifically designed to handle Unicode strings.

The key reason for using UTF-8 encoding is to support a wide range of characters beyond the basic ASCII character set. Unicode allows representation of characters from nearly all languages, and UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that efficiently represents Unicode characters as a sequence of bytes.

If a different character encoding, such as ASCII, were used instead, it would be severely limited in the characters it could represent. Any Unicode character outside the ASCII range would be lost or corrupted during the encoding process. This would lead to incorrect decoding and potentially data loss.  ASCII can only represent 128 characters, whereas UTF-8 can represent millions. The use of UTF-8 ensures that the base58 encoding can handle a wider variety of text data without loss of information.
