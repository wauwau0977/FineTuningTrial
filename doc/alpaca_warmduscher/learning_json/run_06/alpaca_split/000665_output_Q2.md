Using the string literal "sensormock" directly introduces several challenges:

*   **Maintainability:** If the profile name ever needs to change, the developer would need to find and update *every* instance of the string literal throughout the codebase. This is error-prone and time-consuming.
*   **Typos:**  Simple typos in the string literal can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.
*   **Consistency:** It breaks the principle of having a single source of truth for configuration values. Different parts of the application might accidentally use slightly different variations of the profile name.

To address this, I'd recommend the following:

1.  **Code Review:**  Enforce strict code reviews and specifically look for instances of hardcoded profile names.
2.  **IDE Inspection/Linting:** Configure the IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) to highlight or flag hardcoded profile names as warnings or errors. Many IDEs and linting tools can perform this kind of static analysis.
3.  **Refactoring:**  Refactor the code to replace all instances of the string literal with `Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK`.
4.  **Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools into the build process to automatically detect and report violations. SonarQube, FindBugs, or similar tools can help.
5.  **Automated Testing:**  Write unit tests that specifically verify that the application correctly uses the `Profiles` constants instead of hardcoded strings.

This ensures that all profile-related logic uses the defined constants, promoting maintainability, consistency, and reducing the risk of errors.
