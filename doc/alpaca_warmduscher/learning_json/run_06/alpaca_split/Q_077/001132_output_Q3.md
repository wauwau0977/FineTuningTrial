`Math.exp()` calculates the exponential function (e raised to the power of the provided argument).  In this context, the expression `(17.67 * temperature) / (temperature + 243.5)` is the exponent within the exponential function. This exponent is derived from the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, and it represents a component of the saturation vapor pressure calculation.  Specifically, it’s a way to estimate the natural logarithm of the saturation vapor pressure of water at a given temperature (in Celsius). The saturation vapor pressure is the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature. Applying `Math.exp()` then calculates the actual saturation vapor pressure.
