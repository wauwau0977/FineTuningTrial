For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/cache/CachingConfig.java' with name 'CachingConfig.java'... 
Imagine the requirement changes, and you now need to configure an expiration time (TTL - Time To Live) of 60 seconds for the "sessionDeviceCache".  How would you modify the `CachingConfig.java` file to achieve this using the `ConcurrentMapCacheManager`?
