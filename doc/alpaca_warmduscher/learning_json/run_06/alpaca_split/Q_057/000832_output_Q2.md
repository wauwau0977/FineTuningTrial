The `@Repository` annotation is a Spring framework stereotype annotation. Its primary purpose is to indicate that the class (in this case, the interface, which Spring handles via a proxy) is a data access component. 

Here's how it contributes to the application architecture:

*   **Dependency Injection:**  It allows Spring to automatically detect and manage this component as a bean in the application context. This enables dependency injection, allowing other components to easily depend on `AuditLogRepository`.
*   **Exception Translation:** It ensures that exceptions thrown by data access code (e.g., database exceptions) are properly translated into Spring's DataAccessExceptions. This provides a consistent exception handling mechanism throughout the application.
*   **Component Scanning:**  It marks the class for component scanning. Spring's component scanning mechanism will automatically find and register this class as a bean during application startup.
*   **Collaboration with other annotations:**  It works with other Spring annotations to provide a rich development experience.

Essentially, `@Repository` signals to Spring that this interface is responsible for interacting with a data source and should be managed accordingly.
