For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass' with name 'styles.sass'... 
The styles for `mat-card` define `border-color` and `border-width`. Considering best practices for CSS, is this a sensible way to apply these properties, or would you suggest a different approach? Explain your reasoning.
