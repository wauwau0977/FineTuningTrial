For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java'... 
Let's assume the `Physics` class is part of a larger system.  Consider the impact of potential external factors on the accuracy of `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation`.  What kinds of external data or system interactions might affect the reliability of this calculation in a real-world scenario, and how could these factors be incorporated into a more comprehensive testing strategy (beyond unit tests)?
