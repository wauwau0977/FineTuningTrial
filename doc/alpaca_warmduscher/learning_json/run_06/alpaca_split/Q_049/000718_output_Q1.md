The `@Profile(Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK)` annotation indicates that the `MeteoDataMockImpl` component should only be instantiated and used when the Spring application is running with the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile activated. This allows for different implementations of the `MeteoDataService` to be used based on the environment or testing needs.

If the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile isn't active, Spring will not create an instance of `MeteoDataMockImpl`. Instead, it will look for another component that implements the `MeteoDataService` interface and is not associated with a profile, or one associated with an *active* profile.  If no other implementation is found, Spring will likely throw an exception during application startup, indicating that it cannot find a bean of type `MeteoDataService`. This mechanism allows for easy switching between mock data (for testing) and a real data source (in production) without modifying the core application code.
