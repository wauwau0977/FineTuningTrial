The contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()` is crucial for using these objects correctly in collections like `HashSet` or as keys in `HashMap`. It states:

1.  **If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, then their `hashCode()` values *must* be the same.**
2.  **If two objects have the same `hashCode()` value, they are *not necessarily* equal according to `equals()`.** (This is known as a collision, and is expected in hash-based collections.)

It's important to implement them together because hash-based collections rely on both methods. If you violate the contract:

*   **If `equals()` returns true, but `hashCode()` returns different values:** The collection will treat the objects as distinct, even though they are logically equal. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as duplicate entries or incorrect lookups.
*   **If `hashCode()` returns the same value for unequal objects:** The collection might treat unequal objects as equal, leading to data corruption or incorrect retrieval.

In this specific case, the `equals()` method only checks if the `id` fields are equal. The `hashCode()` method only returns the hashcode of the id. This is perfectly acceptable, as long as the `id` field is intended to uniquely identify the `SessionRequest` object. If other fields were considered to determine equality, they would *also* need to be included in the `hashCode()` calculation to maintain the contract.
