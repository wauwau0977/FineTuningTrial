These styles are applied to Angular Material's `mat-card` component. They set the border color to white, the border width to 1px, and add a margin of 12px on the top and bottom, and 3px on the left and right. This aims to give the card a subtle visual separation from surrounding content.

To refactor this for better maintainability, I would suggest the following approach:

1.  **Use SASS Variables:** Define variables for the border color, border width, and margins. This makes it easy to change these values consistently throughout the application. For example:
    ```sass
    $card-border-color: white;
    $card-border-width: 1px;
    $card-margin-top-bottom: 12px;
    $card-margin-left-right: 3px;

    mat-card
      border-color: $card-border-color;
      border-width: $card-border-width;
      margin: $card-margin-top-bottom $card-margin-left-right;
    ```

2.  **Create Mixins:** If you anticipate needing to apply similar card styles to different types of cards, create a mixin. This allows you to reuse the styles easily.
    ```sass
    @mixin card-style( $border-color, $border-width, $margin-top-bottom, $margin-left-right )
      border-color: $border-color;
      border-width: $border-width;
      margin: $margin-top-bottom $margin-left-right;

    mat-card
      @include card-style( white, 1px, 12px, 3px );
    ```

3.  **CSS Classes for Variations:** If you need to apply different card styles, create additional CSS classes with specific variations. For example, you could have `.special-card` or `.highlighted-card` classes that override the default styles.

4.  **Theming (Angular Material):**  The most robust approach within an Angular Material application is to leverage the theming system.  Define card styles as part of your application's theme.  This allows for global changes and consistent styling.
