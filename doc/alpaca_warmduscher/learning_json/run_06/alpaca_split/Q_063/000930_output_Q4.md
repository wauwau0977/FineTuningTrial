The `@Index` annotations in the `SessionRequest` class are used to define database indexes on specific columns of the `SESSION_REQUEST` table. Let's break down what database indexing is, why it's important, and how each index is intended to improve performance.

**What is Database Indexing?**

A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Think of it like the index in a book. Without an index, you would have to scan every page to find information. With an index, you can quickly locate the pages containing the information you need.

**Why is Indexing Important?**

*   **Faster Queries:** Indexes dramatically reduce the time it takes to execute queries, especially on large tables.
*   **Improved Performance:** Faster queries translate to better overall application performance and responsiveness.
*   **Reduced I/O:** Indexes minimize the amount of data that needs to be read from disk, reducing I/O overhead.

**How do the `@Index` annotations work?**

The `@Index` annotation specifies which columns to include in an index and optionally provides a name for the index. The database will create a data structure (typically a B-tree) based on these columns, allowing it to quickly locate rows that match specific criteria.

**Specific Indexes in the `SessionRequest` class:**

1.  **`@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_1", columnList = "requestDate")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Indexes the `requestDate` column.
    *   **Benefit:** This index is useful for queries that filter or sort by request date.  For example:
        *   `SELECT * FROM SESSION_REQUEST WHERE requestDate BETWEEN '2023-10-26' AND '2023-10-27'`
        *   `SELECT * FROM SESSION_REQUEST ORDER BY requestDate DESC`
    *   **Query Type:** Range queries, date-based filtering, sorting by date.

2.  **`@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_2", columnList = "clientId")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Indexes the `clientId` column.
    *   **Benefit:** This index is useful for queries that filter by client ID. For example:
        *   `SELECT * FROM SESSION_REQUEST WHERE clientId = 'client123'`
    *   **Query Type:** Equality queries, filtering by client.

3.  **`@Index(name = "SESSION_REQUEST_IX_3", columnList = "sessionId")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Indexes the `sessionId` column.
    *   **Benefit:** This index is useful for queries that filter by session ID. For example:
        *   `SELECT * FROM SESSION_REQUEST WHERE sessionId = 'session456'`
    *   **Query Type:** Equality queries, filtering by session.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Over-Indexing:** While indexes improve query performance, adding too many indexes can slow down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because the database needs to update the indexes as well.
*   **Index Selectivity:** The effectiveness of an index depends on its selectivity.  A selective index filters a large number of rows, while a non-selective index filters only a few.  Indexes on columns with low cardinality (e.g., boolean values) may not be very effective.
*   **Query Analyzer:** It's crucial to use a database query analyzer to identify slow queries and determine which indexes would be most beneficial.
