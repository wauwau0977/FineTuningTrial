The `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` interface defines a contract for representing aggregated boiler statistics for a specific day of the week. Itâ€™s designed to encapsulate data related to boiler performance trends, enabling analysis and reporting based on daily patterns.

Here's a breakdown of each getter method:

*   **`Integer getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()`**: Returns an integer representing the day of the week, with Monday being 1, Tuesday being 2, and so on up to Sunday being 7. This provides a numerical representation for sorting and indexing the data.
*   **`String getDayOfWeekText()`**: Returns a string representation of the day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday"). This provides a human-readable label for the data.
*   **`Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()`**: Returns a double representing the sum of all decreases in boiler differential pressure (or some other relevant metric) recorded on that specific day of the week. This allows tracking of performance declines.
*   **`Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`**: Returns a double representing the sum of all increases in boiler differential pressure (or the same metric as above) recorded on that specific day of the week. This allows tracking of performance improvements.
*   **`Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`**: Returns a long representing the number of individual statistic records (presumably boiler readings) that were used to calculate the sum of decreases and increases for that day. This provides context for the sums - for example, helps to calculate averages.

A class implementing this interface would likely be populated by a data aggregation process (e.g., a query to a database). The data would then be accessible through the getter methods, allowing for the generation of reports, charts, or other visualizations highlighting daily boiler performance trends.  The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation suggests the interface is intended to be serialized to JSON, likely for use in an API.
