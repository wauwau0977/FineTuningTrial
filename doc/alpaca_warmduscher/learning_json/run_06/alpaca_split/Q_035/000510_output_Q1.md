Using a class like `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` offers several benefits over a POJO: it enforces a defined structure for the data, improving code readability and maintainability; it allows you to encapsulate data and logic related to the entity; it enables you to add methods to the class for performing operations on the data; and it facilitates type checking, which can help prevent errors. However, classes also introduce some overhead in terms of complexity and memory usage.  POJOs are simpler to create and use, and they may be more appropriate for very simple data structures where encapsulation and type safety arenâ€™t critical. In this case, the class provides a clear contract for how this data is structured and used, likely justifying the added complexity.
