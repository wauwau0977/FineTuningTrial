For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissEntity.java' with name 'MeteoSwissEntity.java'... 
Consider the following snippet from the class:
```java
   private Date createDate = new Date();
```
What are the implications of initializing `createDate` directly in the field declaration? How might this affect the behavior of the entity, especially in scenarios involving testing or persistence?
