For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UUIDUtilsTest.java' with name 'UUIDUtilsTest.java'... 
The `testDuplicates` method generates 10,000 short UUIDs and adds them to a `HashSet`. While the comment acknowledges this isn't a *true* evidence of uniqueness, what potential limitations exist with this approach to verify uniqueness, and what would be a more robust, though potentially more resource-intensive, way to thoroughly test for UUID collisions?
