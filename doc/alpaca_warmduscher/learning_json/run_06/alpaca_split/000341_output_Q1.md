The code utilizes Angular's Reactive Forms to handle user input and manage the state of the form data. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**1. Form Group Definition:**

*   `myForm` is a `FormGroup` instance defined within the component's TypeScript file (not visible in the HTML, but implied).  The `FormGroup` is the top-level container for all form controls. It's initialized with `new FormGroup({})`, and the form controls are added to it.

**2. Form Controls & `formControlName`:**

*   Each input field in the HTML is associated with a specific form control defined within the `FormGroup` in the component. This association is established using the `formControlName` attribute. For example:
    *   `<mat-form-field> <input matInput (click)="customFromDate.open()" [matDatepicker]="customFromDate" formControlName="customFromDate"> </mat-form-field>`
    *   Here, `formControlName="customFromDate"` links the input field to a `FormControl` named `customFromDate` within the `myForm` FormGroup.

*   `FormControl` instances represent individual form controls.  They hold the control's value, validation rules, and status (valid, invalid, pristine, dirty, etc.).

**3. `ngSubmit` Event:**

*   The `<form>` tag has an `(ngSubmit)="onMyFormSubmit()"` binding.  This means that when the user submits the form (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a submit button), the `onMyFormSubmit()` method in the component's TypeScript file will be executed.

*   The `onMyFormSubmit()` method is the handler for the form submission event. Inside this method, you can access the form data using the `myForm.value` property. `myForm.value` is an object that contains the values of all the form controls.

**4. Form Data Binding and Access:**

*   **Two-Way Binding:** Reactive Forms provide two-way data binding. This means that any changes the user makes in the input fields are automatically reflected in the corresponding `FormControl` objects, and vice-versa.
*   **Accessing Values:**  Within the `onMyFormSubmit()` method, you can access the form data using `myForm.value`. For example:
    *   `const fromDate = myForm.value.customFromDate;`
    *   `const dataPoints = myForm.value.chartDataPoints;`

**5. Validation (Implied):**

*   Reactive Forms also provide a powerful validation system. You can define validation rules for each form control (e.g., required, min length, max value). Angular will automatically validate the form data when the user submits it.  The form controls' `valid` and `invalid` properties can be used to display validation errors to the user. The provided HTML does not show the validation but the framework enables it by design.

**In Summary:**

Angular's Reactive Forms provide a structured and efficient way to manage form data in an Angular application.  The `formControlName` attribute establishes the connection between the HTML input fields and the corresponding form controls in the component. The `ngSubmit` event triggers the form submission handler, allowing you to access and process the form data.
