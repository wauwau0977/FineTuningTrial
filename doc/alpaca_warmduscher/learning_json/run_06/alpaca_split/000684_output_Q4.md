```java
public ThserverApplication(HeatingDataReadService heatingDataReadService, AuditLogRepository auditLogRepository, InfoBean infoBean, StartupData startupData) {
    this.auditLogRepository = auditLogRepository;
    this.infoBean = infoBean;
    this.startupData = startupData;
    log.info("Created and initialized with heatingDataReadService=" + heatingDataReadService.getClass().getSimpleName());
    log.info("Started " + infoBean);
}
```

The constructor `ThserverApplication` is responsible for initializing the core dependencies of the `ThserverApplication` class through dependency injection.  Spring Boot automatically provides these dependencies when creating an instance of the class.

**Parameters:**

*   `HeatingDataReadService heatingDataReadService`: This parameter is an instance of the `HeatingDataReadService` class, responsible for reading heating data. Although it is received in the constructor it is not used anywhere else in the class.
*   `AuditLogRepository auditLogRepository`: This is an instance of the `AuditLogRepository` interface. It's a Spring Data JPA repository used to persist audit log entries to the database. The class uses this to save startup information via the `logStartup` method.
*   `InfoBean infoBean`: This is an instance of the `InfoBean` class, likely containing server configuration or status details. It is used in the `logStartup` method to include server information in the audit log.
*   `StartupData startupData`: This is an instance of the `StartupData` class, presumably holding information related to the application’s startup times. It’s used in the `logStartup` method to include startup timings in the audit log.

**Initialization:**

The constructor assigns the injected dependencies to private final fields within the class. This ensures that these dependencies are available throughout the lifespan of the `ThserverApplication` instance.

**Logging Statements:**

The constructor includes two logging statements using the `log` instance (which is a SLF4J logger):

*   `log.info("Created and initialized with heatingDataReadService=" + heatingDataReadService.getClass().getSimpleName());`: This logs an informational message indicating that the instance has been created and initialized. It also logs the simple name of the `HeatingDataReadService` class. This is helpful for confirming that the dependency has been properly injected and for identifying the specific implementation being used.
*   `log.info("Started " + infoBean);`: This logs an informational message indicating that the server has started, along with the contents of the `infoBean` object. This provides basic server startup information in the logs.

The logging statements serve as a confirmation that the constructor has executed successfully and that the core dependencies have been initialized. They are particularly useful for debugging and monitoring the application’s startup process.
