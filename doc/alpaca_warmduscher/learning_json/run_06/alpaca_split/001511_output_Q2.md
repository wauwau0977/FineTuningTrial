Comparing `Arrays.toString()` outputs of byte arrays is problematic because it compares string representations of the arrays, not the byte values themselves. This makes the test susceptible to issues with string formatting and locale differences. A change in the `Arrays.toString()` implementation, or the system's locale, could cause the test to fail even if the underlying byte arrays are identical. Also, it's less performant than comparing the byte arrays directly.

A more robust solution is to use `Arrays.equals(randomBytes, decodedBytes)`. This method compares the *contents* of the byte arrays directly, avoiding the string conversion issue and providing a more reliable and performant comparison. The assertion would then become: `assertTrue(Arrays.equals(randomBytes, decodedBytes));` or `assertEquals(randomBytes, decodedBytes);`.
