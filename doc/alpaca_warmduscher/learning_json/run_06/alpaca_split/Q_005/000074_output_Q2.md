To add logging, I would modify the `context.keys().map(context)` line to include a logging statement within the `map` function. Here's the modified code:

```typescript
const context = require.context('./', true, /\.spec\.ts$/);
context.keys().map(context).forEach(module => {
  console.log(`Loaded test file: ${module}`);
});
```

Explanation:

1.  `forEach(module => { ... })`: This adds a `forEach` loop to the `map` function's result. The `map` function executes the `context` call (which loads the module) for each test file. The `forEach` then iterates through the loaded modules (represented by the `module` variable).
2.  `console.log(\`Loaded test file: ${module}\`);`: This logging statement inside the loop prints a message to the console indicating that a test file has been loaded, along with the path to the file (stored in the `module` variable).

Placement: The logging statement is placed *inside* the `forEach` loop, *after* the `context(module)` call.  This ensures that the logging statement is executed *after* each test file is loaded by the `context` function.  Placing it before would log the file path before itâ€™s loaded, which isn't what we want.  The `forEach` is chained onto the `map` so that it only runs after the map has finished iterating.
