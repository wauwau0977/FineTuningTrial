For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts' we have the following question: 
Imagine the `get` method is called multiple times concurrently with the *same* `cacheKey`. Describe the expected behavior of the code, and explain how RxJS and the implementation of `shareReplay(1)` prevent potential race conditions or duplicate API calls.
