For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavor.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavor.java' we have the following question: 
The `decode` method takes a base58 encoded string as input and returns the original byte array. Explain the core logic of this method, specifically detailing how it handles leading zeros, converts the base58 digits to base-256, and what post-processing is applied to the decoded byte array before returning it. Provide a step-by-step explanation, highlighting the purpose of each key section.
