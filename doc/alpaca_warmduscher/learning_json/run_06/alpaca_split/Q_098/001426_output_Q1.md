The `@Component` annotation marks the `InfoBean` class as a Spring-managed component. This means Springâ€™s dependency injection container will automatically detect, instantiate, and manage instances of this class.  Specifically, Spring will scan for classes annotated with `@Component` (or specialized versions like `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`) during application startup. It will then create a bean definition for `InfoBean` and make it available for injection into other Spring-managed components. This enables loose coupling and simplifies application configuration.  Without `@Component`, Spring wouldn't know about this class and wouldn't be able to manage its lifecycle or provide it as a dependency.
