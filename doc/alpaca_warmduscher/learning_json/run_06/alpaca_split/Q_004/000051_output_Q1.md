Defining a fixed height like `100px` can create several issues:

*   **Content Overflow:** If the content within the element exceeds 100px in height, it will overflow, potentially breaking the layout or hiding content.
*   **Responsiveness Issues:** On smaller screens, a fixed height might not be appropriate, leading to content being squashed or appearing incorrectly.  It doesn't adapt to varying screen sizes.
*   **Layout Breaks:** It can constrain the flow of content. If elements below or around `.myLastSpace` rely on its height being dynamic, they may misalign or render incorrectly.

To mitigate these issues, consider the following:

*   **`max-height` instead of `height`:** Use `max-height: 100px;`. This allows the element to grow up to 100px but will adjust downwards if the content is smaller.
*   **Relative Units (%, vh, vw):** Use relative units like percentage (`%`), viewport height (`vh`), or viewport width (`vw`) to make the height adapt to the screen size. For instance, `height: 10vh;` would set the height to 10% of the viewport height.
*   **`min-height` and Content-Driven Height:** Use `min-height` to ensure the element doesn't collapse entirely, but let the content determine the actual height.
*   **Flexbox or Grid:**  If the element is part of a layout using Flexbox or Grid, let those systems manage the height dynamically based on the content and other elements.
