For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java'... 
Given the test case `PhysicsTest.java`, and assuming the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method exists in a `Physics` class, what potential issues do you foresee with this testing approach? Specifically, focus on the use of hardcoded expected ranges and the reliance on `System.out.println` for debugging. How would you improve this test to make it more robust and maintainable?
