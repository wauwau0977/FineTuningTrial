To introduce a mock of a service dependency, I would use the `@MockBean` annotation provided by Spring's `spring-test` module.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@SpringBootTest
public class ThserverApplicationTests {

    @MockBean
    private MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    private MyController myController; // Assuming MyController depends on MyService

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() {
        // Now, when MyController is used, it will receive a mock instance of MyService.
        // I can then set up the mock to return specific values or throw exceptions to test
        // different scenarios in MyController.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@MockBean`: This annotation tells Spring to replace the real implementation of `MyService` with a mock object during the test.  It also registers the mock as a bean in the application context. This is crucial because Spring will automatically inject this mock instance wherever `MyService` is needed (e.g., in `MyController`).  If `MyService` was a real bean in the main application context, `@MockBean` effectively overrides it for the scope of *this* test.

This allows me to isolate the component under test (e.g., `MyController`) and control the behavior of its dependencies (e.g., `MyService`) without relying on the real implementation or external resources.  I can then use a mocking framework like Mockito to set up the expected behavior of the mock and verify that the component under test interacts with it as expected.
