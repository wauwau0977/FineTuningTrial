The naming convention, with both standard getters (e.g., `getBoilerTemp()`) and 'Min/Max' getters (e.g., `getBoilerTempMin()`, `getBoilerTempMax()`), strongly suggests the use of a **Range** or **Interval** pattern. This pattern represents a value that has a lower and upper bound. 

In the context of heat pump statistics, this is highly useful. It suggests that the data captured isn't just instantaneous readings, but rather tracking the *range* of values over a specific period (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly). For example, `getBoilerTempMin()` and `getBoilerTempMax()` indicate that the system is storing the minimum and maximum boiler temperatures recorded during the measurement period.

This design choice allows for more insightful analysis.  Instead of only knowing the current boiler temperature, we can understand the temperature fluctuations over time, identify potential anomalies (e.g., unusually wide temperature swings), and calculate statistics like average temperature, standard deviation, or temperature range. It enables trend analysis and more informed decision-making regarding system performance and maintenance.
