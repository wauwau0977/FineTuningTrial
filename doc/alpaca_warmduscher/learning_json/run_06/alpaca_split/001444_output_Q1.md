Using kilobytes (KB) as the unit of measurement for memory provides a balance between readability and granularity. It's a commonly understood unit, making the values relatively easy to interpret.  It avoids extremely large numbers that bytes would produce, and provides a reasonable level of detail for most monitoring purposes.

However, there are disadvantages. As memory capacities continue to grow, even megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB) might be more appropriate for displaying overall memory usage. For very large systems, expressing memory in GB or TB enhances readability and reduces the number of digits displayed.  Also, KB isn't a power of two in the strictest sense (1024 vs 1000), which can lead to slight inaccuracies.

Alternatives include:

*   **Bytes:** Provides the most granular detail, but results in very large numbers for modern systems.
*   **Megabytes (MB) / Gigabytes (GB) / Terabytes (TB):** Improves readability for larger memory capacities. The best choice depends on the expected scale of the system.
*   **Human-readable format:** Libraries exist to automatically convert numbers to human-readable formats (e.g., "1.2 MB", "5 GB"). This provides the most user-friendly experience but adds a dependency and some computational overhead.

The trade-off is between precision, readability, and the need for libraries. For the likely scale of memory monitoring in this application, kilobytes might be sufficient, but a design that allows for easy switching to MB or GB would be more flexible.
