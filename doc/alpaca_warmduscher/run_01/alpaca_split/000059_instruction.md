You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the `MeteoDataService` interface, a core component of the 'Warmduscher' project. The service is responsible for initializing and retrieving meteorological data from an external source (likely MeteoSwiss, as suggested by the package and entity names) and storing or making it available to other parts of the application.  The primary function is to provide access to historical or real-time weather data.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataService.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoDataService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Initialize the service, potentially establishing connections to data sources and loading initial data.
    - Retrieve a list of meteorological data entries.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** None directly exposed through the interface. Initialization may involve configuration parameters (not specified in the code).
    - **Outputs:** A `List<MeteoSwissEntity>` containing meteorological data.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. `init()` is called to prepare the service (e.g., connect to an external API or database).
    2. `getData()` is called to retrieve the latest or historical meteorological data. The data is returned as a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.
- **External Interactions:**
    - The implementation of `MeteoDataService` will likely interact with:
        - A MeteoSwiss API or data source.
        - A database to store the retrieved data (as evidenced by the `MeteoSwissEntity`).
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - `init()`: Handle potential connection errors to the MeteoSwiss source.
    - `getData()`: Handle cases where no data is available or an error occurs during retrieval (e.g., return an empty list or throw an exception).  Consider how the service handles stale or invalid data.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - `init()`: Should complete within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 30 seconds) to avoid delays when the application starts.
    - `getData()`: Should return data quickly (e.g., under 1 second) to ensure a responsive user experience.
- **Scalability:** The service should be able to handle a growing number of requests for meteorological data without significant performance degradation. Consider caching mechanisms.
- **Security:**  If the service interacts with an external API, ensure secure communication (e.g., using HTTPS).
- **Maintainability:** The implementation should follow clean coding principles and be well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and modifications.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The service should be robust and handle errors gracefully to minimize downtime.
- **Usability:** N/A - This is an interface, not a UI component.
- **Compliance:** The service should adhere to any relevant data privacy regulations and MeteoSwiss API usage terms.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `init()`: Initializes the service and prepares it to retrieve data.
    - `getData()`: Retrieves a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects containing meteorological data.
- **Important logic flows:** The main flow involves initialization followed by data retrieval.  The implementation will determine the specific data source, retrieval method, and data storage mechanism.
- **Error handling:** Implement robust error handling in both `init()` and `getData()` to handle potential failures and prevent application crashes.
- **Classes:**
    - `MeteoSwissEntity`: A data transfer object (DTO) representing a single meteorological data entry.
- **Modules:** The service could be implemented as a separate module within the `thserver` application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Lists:  Used for returning the data.
- Data structures: May utilize maps or sets internally for caching or data processing.
- Exception handling.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
-  None explicitly defined in the interface itself, but a concrete implementation may use:
    - HTTP clients (e.g., `HttpClient`, `RestTemplate`) for interacting with the MeteoSwiss API.
    - JSON parsing libraries (e.g., `Jackson`, `Gson`) for handling API responses.
    - Database drivers (e.g., JDBC) for database connectivity.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissEntity`:  Used as the data model for the retrieved weather data.
- Other internal utility or database access components may be used in the implementation.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:**
    - Implement caching to reduce the number of calls to the MeteoSwiss API or database.
    - Optimize database queries for faster data retrieval.
- **Code Readability:** The interface is already simple and readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Implement secure communication with the MeteoSwiss API (e.g., using HTTPS). Validate data received from the API.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  Consider using a message queue or other asynchronous mechanism to handle a large number of requests for meteorological data.  Database sharding or replication may be necessary for very large datasets. Consider using a distributed cache.
