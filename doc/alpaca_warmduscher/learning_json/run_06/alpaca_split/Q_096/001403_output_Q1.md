The `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats` method, in its current design, partially adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, but also has areas for improvement.

**Open/Closed Principle:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.

**Analysis of `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats`:**

The method is designed to accommodate different ways of limiting the data returned (either by `maxRows` or `groupEveryNthSecon`). This is a good step toward openness because it allows for flexibility in how the data is retrieved without fundamentally altering the methodâ€™s core logic.

However, if a new way to limit or process the data were required (e.g., filtering by a specific data range or applying a custom aggregation function), the method would need to be modified. This violates the closed aspect of the principle.

**How to improve adherence to the Open/Closed Principle:**

1.  **Strategy Pattern:** Implement a Strategy Pattern. Define an interface for data limiting/processing (e.g., `DataLimiter`). Implement different concrete strategies for each limiting method (e.g., `MaxRowsLimiter`, `FixedIntervalLimiter`, `CustomFilterLimiter`). The `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats` method could then accept a `DataLimiter` instance as a parameter and delegate the limiting logic to that strategy.

2.  **Predicate/Function Interface:** Pass a `Predicate` or `Function` interface to filter or transform the data before returning it.  This allows clients to customize the data retrieval without modifying the method.

By adopting one of these approaches, the method could remain closed for modification (the core logic remains unchanged), while still being open for extension (new ways of limiting or processing data can be added without altering the existing code). This would lead to a more flexible, maintainable, and testable codebase.
