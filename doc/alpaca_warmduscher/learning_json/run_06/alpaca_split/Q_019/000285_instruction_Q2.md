For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.html' with name 'about.component.html'... 
The file contains several `<mat-card>` components, each displaying a different aspect of the project. How could you modify this component to support dynamic data loading, where the content of each card is fetched from an external source (e.g., a REST API)?
