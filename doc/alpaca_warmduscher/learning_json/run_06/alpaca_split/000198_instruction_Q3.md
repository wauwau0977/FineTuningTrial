For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.ts' with name 'client-id.service.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
private clientId: string | null = '';
 constructor() {
   // check if we have an ID already
   this.clientId = localStorage.getItem(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID);
   // ...
 }
```

What is the purpose of initializing `clientId` to an empty string and then attempting to retrieve a value from `localStorage` in the constructor? Explain how this impacts the logic of the service.
