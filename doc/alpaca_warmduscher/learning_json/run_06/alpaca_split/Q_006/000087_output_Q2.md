`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` is used to configure the root router module. It initializes the router and sets up the initial routes for the application.  Critically, it should *only* be used once in your application – typically in the root `AppRoutingModule`. It also performs important setup like listening for browser history events.

`RouterModule.forChild(routes)` is used to configure router modules for feature modules or lazy-loaded modules. It's used when you want to add routes within a specific module without reconfiguring the root router.  It assumes that the root router has already been initialized.  It doesn't perform the same global setup as `forRoot()`.

If we were to use `RouterModule.forChild(routes)` in `AppRoutingModule`, the application's routing likely wouldn’t work correctly. The root router wouldn't be initialized, and navigation wouldn't function as expected.  You would *only* use `forChild` in modules that import the `AppRoutingModule`.
