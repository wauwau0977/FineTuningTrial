The `ofWebService` method serves as a factory method, responsible for creating instances of `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` from data received from a web service. It's designed to handle data originating from an external source, ensuring a valid object is always returned, even when the web service provides incomplete or null data.

The `if (data == null)` condition is a crucial part of this handling. It checks if the `data` received from the web service is null or undefined. If it is, the method returns `this.emptyInstance()`, which provides a default instance with zero values. This prevents errors that would occur if the code attempted to access properties of a null object and provides a safe fallback mechanism, ensuring the application doesn't crash or exhibit unexpected behavior when dealing with missing web service data. Itâ€™s a form of defensive programming. If the data *is* present, a new `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` is constructed using the values from the `data` object.
