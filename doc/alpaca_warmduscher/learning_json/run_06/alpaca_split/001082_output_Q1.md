In the `decode` method, a `RuntimeException` with the message "InvalidCharacter" can occur if the input string contains a character that is not present in the base58 alphabet. This happens within the loop where the input string is being converted into a byte array (`input58`). Specifically, the line `if (digit < 0)` checks if the index of the character `c` in the `INDEXES` array is negative.  If `c` is not found in the alphabet, `INDEXES[c]` will return -1, triggering the exception.

The code handles this exception by immediately throwing a `RuntimeException` with a descriptive message including the invalid character and its index in the input string. This immediately stops the decoding process and signals to the caller that the input string is invalid. While a custom exception type might be more robust, the use of `RuntimeException` provides a clear and immediate indication of an invalid input.
