"Cross-context" in this situation refers to the interaction between different execution contexts, primarily within iframes or Web Workers in older versions of Internet Explorer/Edge.  Zone.js, by default, performs checks to ensure that event listeners are attached to the same context (e.g., the same `window` object) as the event source. This is a safety mechanism to prevent potential issues where events might be incorrectly handled or lead to memory leaks.

However, in older versions of IE/Edge, iframes or Web Workers could create different execution contexts that weren't properly managed by Zone.js.  The `__Zone_enable_cross_context_check` flag disables this strict context checking. This is necessary because those older browsers might incorrectly report different execution contexts for the same window, causing Zone.js to incorrectly flag legitimate event handling as a security risk or error.

Disabling the check allows Zone.js to bypass the context validation, enabling event handling to function correctly in those specific configurations.  It's important to note that disabling this check introduces a potential security risk if the application is not designed to handle events from different contexts securely.  Therefore, this flag should only be used as a workaround for compatibility issues in older browsers, and the application should be carefully tested to ensure its security.
