For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByHour.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
   Integer getHourOfTheDay();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease();
   Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1();
```

These methods are defined as interface methods. What does this imply about the classes that implement this interface, and what is the purpose of these specific getter methods in the context of boiler statistics?
