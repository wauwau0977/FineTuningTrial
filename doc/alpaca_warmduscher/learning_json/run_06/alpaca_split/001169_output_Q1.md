Providing multiple overloads allows for more tailored and convenient usage based on the type of operation being executed. A single, generic method would require the caller to adapt their operation to a specific interface (e.g., wrapping a simple runnable in a Callable). These overloads reduce boilerplate and make the utility more user-friendly. For example, if you have a function that takes a parameter and returns a result, you can directly use `execute(Function, param)` without needing to wrap it in a Callable.

The trade-off is increased code duplication â€“ the try-catch structure is repeated in each overload. While slight, it introduces maintenance overhead. A potential alternative could be to use Java 8's default methods in an interface to provide the common functionality, reducing duplication. However, given the simplicity of the utility, the duplication is likely minimal and the benefit of more straightforward, readable method signatures outweighs the maintenance cost.
