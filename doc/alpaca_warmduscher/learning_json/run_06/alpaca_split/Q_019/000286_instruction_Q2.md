For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.html' with name 'about.component.html'... 
Looking at the `<buildTimestampClient>` and `<buildTimestampServer>` elements at the bottom of the file, what purpose do these timestamps serve, and how could they be useful for debugging or monitoring the application?
