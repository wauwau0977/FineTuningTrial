For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts'... 
Consider the `ofWebService` method. If the `data` object contained an invalid value for `dayOfWeekStartingMonday` (e.g., a string instead of a number, or a number outside the valid range of 0-6), how would you improve this method to handle such cases? Describe the approach youâ€™d take and provide a code snippet illustrating your changes.
