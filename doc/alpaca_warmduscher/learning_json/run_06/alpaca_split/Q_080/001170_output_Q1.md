The name "Unsafe" immediately raises red flags. It suggests that using this utility might bypass standard error handling or introduce unexpected behavior. This is a poor naming practice, as it doesn't clearly convey the purpose of the interface and might lead developers to avoid it or misuse it. It violates the principle of least astonishment.

The justification for choosing such a name is likely to signal that the methods are intended for situations where standard exception handling is either too verbose or unnecessary. The developers might be prioritizing simplicity and speed in specific use cases and view the lack of detailed error handling as a deliberate trade-off. It could also be a signal to developers that these methods should be used cautiously and only when the risks are understood. However, a better name – perhaps "Utility" or "ExecutionHelper" – would be far more descriptive and less alarming. The current name is more likely to cause confusion and potential errors than it is to promote safe usage.
