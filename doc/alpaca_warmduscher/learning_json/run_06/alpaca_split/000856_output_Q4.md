The `CrudRepository` interface is a core component of Spring Data JPA, providing a standard set of methods for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database entity.  In this `MeteoSwissRepository`, it serves as the base interface, extending it with the custom `getLastEntries` query.  This means that `MeteoSwissRepository` automatically inherits a suite of pre-defined methods without requiring explicit implementation.

Here are three examples of standard methods provided by `CrudRepository` and how they could be utilized (or are potentially utilized) within the context of this repository:

1.  **`findAll()`:** This method retrieves all entities of type `MeteoSwissEntity` from the database. Although not explicitly used in the provided code snippet, it could be used to fetch all historical temperature measurements for analysis or reporting.  The return type is `Iterable<MeteoSwissEntity>`.

2.  **`findById(String id)`:** This method retrieves an entity by its primary key (in this case, a `String` representing the entity's ID). This could be used to fetch a specific temperature measurement entry based on its unique identifier.  It returns an `Optional<MeteoSwissEntity>`, allowing for graceful handling of cases where the entity is not found.

3.  **`save(MeteoSwissEntity entity)`:** This method saves a `MeteoSwissEntity` to the database. If the entity already exists, it updates the existing record; otherwise, it inserts a new one. This could be used to add new temperature measurements to the database or update existing ones.  It returns the saved entity.

Other commonly used methods include `count()`, `deleteById()`, and `delete(entity)`.  By extending `CrudRepository`, the developer gains access to these methods without needing to write the underlying database interaction code. This significantly reduces boilerplate and promotes code reusability.
