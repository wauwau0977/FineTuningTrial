For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MySessionFilter.java' with name 'MySessionFilter.java'... 
The `getClientId` method simply returns the value of the `TH_SERVER_SESSIOn_ID` header.  Considering the overall design of the filter and the data it collects, what potential issues could arise from relying solely on the header for the client ID, and what alternative approaches could you suggest for more reliable client identification?
