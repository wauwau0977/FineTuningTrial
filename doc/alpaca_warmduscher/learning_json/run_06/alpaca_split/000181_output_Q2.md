Relying solely on integration/e2e tests for `ClientIdService` has several drawbacks:

*   **Slow Feedback Loop:** Integration/e2e tests are much slower to run than unit tests.  Fixing a bug in `ClientIdService` would require running the entire integration/e2e suite, significantly increasing development time.
*   **Difficult Debugging:**  If an integration/e2e test fails, it's often harder to pinpoint the root cause. The failure could be due to `ClientIdService`, or a problem in another component or the test environment itself.
*   **Brittle Tests:** Integration/e2e tests are more susceptible to breaking due to changes in the UI or other parts of the application. A seemingly unrelated UI change could cause an integration test involving `ClientIdService` to fail.
*   **Limited Coverage:** Integration/e2e tests typically focus on the overall functionality of the application and may not cover all the edge cases or internal logic of `ClientIdService`.
*   **Increased Complexity:** They require setting up and maintaining a complete application environment, making them more complex to write and maintain.

Dedicated unit tests, like the ones shown, provide several advantages:

*   **Fast Execution:** Unit tests run very quickly, providing immediate feedback on code changes.
*   **Precise Error Isolation:** Unit tests focus on a single unit of code (in this case, `ClientIdService`), making it easier to identify and fix bugs.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** You can write unit tests to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases for `ClientIdService`.
*   **Simplified Debugging:** Unit tests are easier to debug because they are isolated and focused on a specific unit of code.
*   **Code Design and Documentation:** Writing unit tests forces you to think about the design of your code and can serve as a form of documentation.

In summary, unit tests are essential for ensuring the quality and maintainability of individual components like `ClientIdService`, while integration/e2e tests are important for verifying that all the components work together correctly. They complement each other, and a comprehensive testing strategy should include both.
