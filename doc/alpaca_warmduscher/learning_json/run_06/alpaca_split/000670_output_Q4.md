The `Profiles` class serves as a centralized location to define different application profiles or configurations. It's a simple class consisting solely of static final String constants.

`DEFAULT`: This constant, set to the string "default", likely represents the standard, production-ready configuration of the application. It's a fallback profile when no other specific profile is specified.

`SENSOR_MOCK`: This constant, set to the string "sensormock", indicates a profile used for testing or development purposes. It suggests the application can be configured to use a mock implementation of the sensor (or sensor interaction logic) instead of the real sensor or service.  This allows for testing the application without relying on actual sensor hardware, facilitating unit and integration tests.  

The use of these constants likely enables a mechanism (potentially through configuration files, environment variables, or command-line arguments) to switch between different behaviors of the application based on the selected profile. This provides flexibility for development, testing, and deployment.
