The naming convention is problematic because it introduces ambiguity. 'clientId' generally implies the identifier of the *client application* itself, while 'clientSessionId' clearly indicates an identifier specific to a particular user session within that application. Mixing these concepts within the same field name creates confusion for anyone reading or maintaining the code.

To improve readability and maintainability, I would rename the field to `clientSessionId` to accurately reflect its purpose. This change would immediately clarify the meaning of the field and prevent potential misunderstandings. Itâ€™s important to have consistent and descriptive naming conventions throughout the codebase to promote clarity and make it easier for developers to understand and work with the code. It is also good practice to avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that are not widely understood within the team.
