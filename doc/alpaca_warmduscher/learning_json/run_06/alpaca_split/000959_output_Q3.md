The fact that these are interface methods means that *any* class that implements `BoilerStatsByHour` *must* provide a concrete implementation for each of these methods. It enforces a contract – any implementing class *guarantees* to have these methods and return the specified data types.  This allows for polymorphism – different classes can implement the interface in different ways, but clients can interact with them uniformly through the interface.

In the context of boiler statistics, these getter methods are designed to retrieve specific aggregated data for a given hour. 

*   `getHourOfTheDay()` likely returns the hour of the day (0-23) for which the statistics are calculated.
*   `getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()` likely returns the cumulative decrease in boiler temperature differences during that hour.  This could represent heat loss or a period where the boiler is not actively heating.
*   `getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()` likely returns the cumulative increase in boiler temperature differences during that hour. This represents the amount of heat the boiler provided.
*   `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()` likely returns the number of individual sensor readings or statistic records that were used to calculate the hour's statistics. This provides a measure of the data's density or reliability.

Together, these methods provide a snapshot of boiler performance for a specific hour, allowing for trend analysis and identification of potential issues or inefficiencies.
