These properties set up a flexible layout for the buttons. `display: flex` enables flexbox layout for the button element. `flex-direction: column` arranges the child elements (likely an icon and text) vertically, stacking them on top of each other within the button.  `align-items: center` horizontally centers these child elements within the button. The combination results in a button where content is stacked vertically and centered horizontally within the button's bounds. Since the `width: 100%` is applied to the button, each button spans the entire available width within the flex container (toolbar).
