Based on the configuration `type: 'column'`, a column chart (also known as a bar chart) is being created.

This chart visualizes the `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek` data by displaying each data point as a separate column. The height of each column corresponds to the value of the data point at that index.  Therefore, the chart shows a comparison of the values for each day of the week.

The expected data in `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek` is an array of numbers. Each number represents the 'Boiler Gebrauch' (boiler usage) for a specific day of the week.  The order of the numbers in the array is crucial, as it corresponds to the order of days defined in the `xAxis.categories` array.

The `xAxis.categories` array – `['Mo', 'Di', 'Mi', 'Do', 'Fr', 'Sa', 'So']` – is vital for interpreting the chart. It provides the labels for each column on the x-axis. Specifically:

*   `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek[0]` corresponds to 'Mo' (Monday)
*   `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek[1]` corresponds to 'Di' (Tuesday)
*   `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek[2]` corresponds to 'Mi' (Wednesday)
*   And so on...

Without the `categories` array, the x-axis would simply display numerical indices (0, 1, 2, etc.), making it difficult to understand which day each column represents.  The `categories` array provides the semantic meaning, allowing viewers to easily see the boiler usage for each day of the week.
