The purpose of this constructor is to initialize the `ThserverApplication` class with several dependencies. These dependencies are injected via the constructor parameters, enabling dependency injection. Specifically:

*   `HeatingDataReadService`: This service likely handles reading data from heating sensors. The log statement indicates that the class name of the injected instance is being logged for informational purposes.
*   `AuditLogRepository`: This repository is used to persist audit log entries, allowing the application to track events.
*   `InfoBean`: This bean likely holds information about the server, such as version details or configuration settings.
*   `StartupData`: This object seems to contain data related to the application's startup process, such as timing information.

The constructor assigns these injected dependencies to private final fields of the class, ensuring that they are available for use throughout the application's lifecycle.  This promotes loose coupling and testability.
