For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java' with name 'UnsafeRunnable.java'... 
This interface is very simple. What problem does defining a functional interface that *allows* throwing checked exceptions solve, compared to simply declaring the method as throwing an exception in the calling code? Discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach in the context of handling potentially failing asynchronous operations within a larger system like 'Warmduscher'.
