The `myReload()` method is the core function responsible for fetching and processing historical heating and meteorological data to populate various charts within the `BoilerChartComponent`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

**1. Initialization & Loading Flags:**

*   It starts by setting loading flags (`this.loading`, `this.loadingBoilerByHour`, `this.loadingBoilerByDayOfWeek`) to `true` to indicate data fetching is in progress.
*   It determines whether to fetch data based on a predefined interval or a specific number of data points based on the value of `this.isIntervalAutoMatching()`.

**2. Service Calls & Data Fetching:**

*   It calls multiple services from `this.heatingDataService` to retrieve data:
    *   `getHistorical()`:  Fetches historical heating data.
    *   `getMeteoSwissHistorical()`: Fetches historical meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    *   `getBoilerStatsByHour()`: Fetches boiler statistics by the hour.
    *   `getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek()`: Fetches boiler statistics by day of the week.
    *   `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats()`: Fetches sole delta in operation statistics.
*   It defines `stationIds` to add 'KLO' and 'SHA' into the weather station list.

**3. `forkJoin` and Parallel Data Handling:**

*   `forkJoin([serviceHeatingDataHistorical, serviceMeteoSwissHistorical])`: This is a crucial part of the method. `forkJoin` is an RxJS operator that takes an array of Observables and returns a single Observable that emits an array of the values emitted by each of the input Observables, *only when all* of the input Observables have completed.
    *   This allows the `getHistorical()` and `getMeteoSwissHistorical()` calls to run in parallel, improving performance.
    *   The `next` callback function within the `subscribe()` block receives an array containing the results of both service calls (`results[0]` for heating data, `results[1]` for meteorological data).

**4. Data Processing & Population of Data Structures:**

*   Inside the `next` callback, the received data is processed and used to populate various array data structures. These arrays will ultimately be used to generate the charts:
    *   `this.boilerTempAverage`, `this.boilerTempMinMax`, `this.boilerTempDeltaTemp`: Store boiler temperature data.
    *   `this.soleInTempAverage`, `this.soleInTempMinMax`, `this.soleOutTempMinMax`, `this.soleTempDelta`, `this.soleTempDeltaInOperationAvg`, `this.soleTempDeltaInOperationMinMax`: Store sole temperature data.
    *   `this.heatingInTempMinMax`, `this.heatingOutTempMinMax`, `this.heatingTempDelta`: Store heating temperature data.
    *   `this.compressorHours`: Stores compressor hours.
    *   `this.outdoorTempAverage`, `this.outdoorTempMinMax`: Stores outdoor temperature data.
    *   `this.windGustMeteoSwiss`: Stores wind gust data.
    *   `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek`: Stores Boiler Stats By Day of Week.
    *   `this.boilerStatsByHour`: Stores Boiler Stats By Hour.
*   It iterates through the received `heatingEntites` and `meteoEntites` to populate these arrays with data points in a format suitable for charting (typically `[timestamp, value]`).
*   The method also includes code to process `operationChartSeries` to make a custom chart.

**5. MeteoSwiss Data Handling:**

*   The method extracts and populates  `this.outdoorTempAverageMeteo1`, `this.outdoorTempAverageMeteo2` and `this.windGustMeteoSwiss` based on the weather station id.

**In Summary:**

The `myReload()` method orchestrates the fetching of historical data from multiple services, processes the received data, and populates various data structures that are used to generate charts visualizing heating system performance and meteorological conditions. `forkJoin` is critical for enabling parallel execution of service calls, improving performance and responsiveness. It is a core part of the component, responsible for all the data that is being displayed on the user interface.
