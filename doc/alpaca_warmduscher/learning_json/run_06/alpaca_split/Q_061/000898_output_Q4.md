The purpose of having both minimum and maximum values for metrics like temperature and operational hours is to provide a range of values observed over a specific period. This provides more comprehensive insights than just a single, instantaneous reading. Instead of knowing just *what* the temperature currently is, or *how many* hours the compressor has run, we gain a sense of the *variation* and *extremes* within that period.

Here's a real-world scenario:

Imagine a heating system monitoring application used by a service technician. If the technician only sees the current `BoilerTemp`, they might not realize if there's a problem. However, if they see that the `BoilerTemp` is currently 60°C, but the `BoilerTempMin` over the last 24 hours was 45°C, and the `BoilerTempMax` was 70°C, it signals a significant fluctuation. This fluctuation could indicate:

*   **Scale buildup:** If the minimum temperature is consistently low, it could suggest scale buildup is reducing heat transfer efficiency.
*   **Faulty sensor:** A large range could indicate an issue with the temperature sensor itself, providing unreliable readings.
*   **System inefficiency:** Wide temperature swings might signify an underlying problem with the heating system’s control logic or components.

This information, coupled with other metrics like compressor hours, allows the technician to proactively identify potential issues and schedule maintenance before they lead to a system failure, improving system reliability and customer satisfaction. The min/max values, therefore, are crucial for trending, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance applications.
