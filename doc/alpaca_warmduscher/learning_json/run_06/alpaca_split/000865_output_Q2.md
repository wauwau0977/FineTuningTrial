Using native SQL queries, as done in both `findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats` and `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`, provides several advantages but also introduces potential drawbacks compared to using JPA’s Criteria API or QueryDSL.

**Advantages:**

*   **Performance:** Native SQL can be more performant, especially for complex queries. Database-specific optimizations can be leveraged directly. In this case, the use of `ntile` and the `extract(epoch ...)` functions are potentially more efficient when expressed directly in SQL.
*   **Control:** Native SQL gives the developer complete control over the generated SQL, allowing them to fine-tune the query for optimal performance and utilize database-specific features.
*   **Complexity:** For very complex queries that are difficult to express using JPA or QueryDSL, native SQL can be a simpler and more maintainable solution.  The complex aggregation in these queries might be easier to understand and write in SQL.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Database Dependency:** Native SQL queries are tied to a specific database. Changing databases requires rewriting the queries, increasing maintenance costs and reducing portability.
*   **Security Risks:**  Incorrectly constructed native SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Proper parameterization is crucial but requires extra attention.
*   **Type Safety:**  Native SQL queries lack compile-time type safety. Errors related to data types or column names might only be discovered at runtime.
*   **Maintainability:**  Native SQL queries can be more difficult to maintain, especially as the application grows. The lack of abstraction can make it harder to understand the query's purpose and intent.
*   **JPA Benefits Lost:**  Using native SQL bypasses many of the benefits of JPA, such as object-relational mapping and caching.

**In this scenario:**

Given the complexity of the queries involving `ntile`, `extract(epoch)`, and the need for database-specific optimizations, the developers likely chose native SQL for performance and control. However, they’ve increased the risk of database dependency and maintainability issues. If portability and maintainability were higher priorities, using JPA or QueryDSL, even with a potential performance trade-off, might have been a better choice. Careful use of parameterized queries is critical to mitigate SQL injection risks.
