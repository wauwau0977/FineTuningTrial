The `Hooks` interface facilitates accommodating sensor diversity through polymorphism.  We would create concrete implementations of the `Hooks` interface for each sensor type.

For example:

```java
interface Hooks<T> {
    void before(T t) throws Throwable;
    void after(T t) throws Throwable;
}

class TemperatureSensorHooks implements Hooks<TemperatureData> {
    @Override
    public void before(TemperatureData data) throws Throwable {
        // Specific pre-processing for temperature data (e.g., calibration)
    }

    @Override
    public void after(TemperatureData data) throws Throwable {
        // Specific post-processing for temperature data (e.g., logging)
    }
}

class HumiditySensorHooks implements Hooks<HumidityData> {
    @Override
    public void before(HumidityData data) throws Throwable {
        // Specific pre-processing for humidity data
    }

    @Override
    public void after(HumidityData data) throws Throwable {
        // Specific post-processing for humidity data
    }
}
```

To prevent code duplication, several strategies can be employed:

1.  **Base Class/Abstract Class:**  Create an abstract base class that implements `Hooks` and provides common functionality. Sensor-specific hooks can then extend this base class and override only the necessary methods.  This avoids repeating identical code in each hook implementation.

2.  **Composition:** Extract shared functionality into separate helper classes or methods. The hook implementations can then *compose* these helpers to achieve their desired behavior.

3.  **Dependency Injection:** Inject any necessary dependencies (e.g., logging services, calibration algorithms) into the hook implementations. This promotes loose coupling and makes the hooks more testable.

4. **Generics and Functional Interfaces:** If the pre/post processing steps share a common pattern (e.g., applying a transformation function), consider using functional interfaces and generics to parameterize the hook behavior.

The choice of which approach to use depends on the specific similarities and differences between the sensor types. A combination of these techniques might be the most effective solution.
