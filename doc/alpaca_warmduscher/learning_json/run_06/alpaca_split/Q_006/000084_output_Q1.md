I would add a route definition to the `routes` array that specifies an empty path (`''`) and a `redirectTo` property that points to the desired component's route.  The `pathMatch: 'full'` ensures that the redirect only occurs when the user navigates to the exact root path (e.g., `/`), not when they navigate to paths that *begin* with `/`.

Here's the code I would add:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' } // Redirect to /home if no path is specified
  // Other routes would go here
];
```

Explanation:

*   `path: ''`: This defines a route that matches the empty path (root URL).
*   `redirectTo: '/home'`:  This specifies that when the empty path is matched, the user should be redirected to the `/home` route.
*   `pathMatch: 'full'`: This is crucial. It tells Angular to only perform the redirect if the requested URL exactly matches the path (`''`). Without it, any URL starting with `/` would be redirected, which is likely not the intended behavior.

This ensures that when a user visits the root URL of the application, they will automatically be redirected to the home component (assuming a route for `/home` exists elsewhere in the application).
