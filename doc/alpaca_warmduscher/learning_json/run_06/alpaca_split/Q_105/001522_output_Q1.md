This test class, `PhysicsTest`, is designed to verify the functionality of the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method. It tests the method with three different temperature and humidity input pairs (20Â°C/80%, 20Â°C/90%, and 5Â°C/50%) and asserts that the returned absolute humidity value falls within a specific range for each input.

The limitations of this approach are several. Firstly, it only tests three specific input values. While these values might cover common scenarios, they don't provide comprehensive coverage of the entire input space. Boundary values, extreme values (very high/low temperature/humidity), and edge cases aren't explicitly tested. Secondly, it uses a relatively narrow assertion range (e.g., `ah > 13.7 && ah < 13.9`). This might mask small inaccuracies in the calculation.  Thirdly, there's no testing of error handling; the code doesn't check if the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method throws exceptions with invalid inputs (e.g., negative temperature). Finally, the tests rely on `System.out.println` which doesnâ€™t contribute to automated test verification, and are just for debugging.
