For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.html' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.html' we have the following question: 
Assume that the `gaugeChartOptions` input to the `highcharts-chart` component is an object that defines the chart's series and axis configurations. Describe the minimal `gaugeChartOptions` object structure required to create a basic gauge chart with a single data point that displays a value between 0 and 100.  Be specific about the required properties and their corresponding data types. You do not need to provide actual data values; focus on the structure of the object itself.
