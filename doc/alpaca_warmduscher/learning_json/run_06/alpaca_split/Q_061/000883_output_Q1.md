Having a large number of methods in an interface can lead to several downsides. Primarily, it reduces readability and maintainability. It makes it harder to understand the contract the interface defines, and changes require more effort as they might affect many clients of the interface.  Secondly, it increases coupling. Clients that depend on this interface are implicitly coupled to all the methods, even if they only use a subset.  This can hinder future flexibility and refactoring.

Mitigation strategies include:

*   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Break down this large interface into smaller, more focused interfaces. For example, create interfaces like `BoilerStatistics`, `CompressorStatistics`, `TemperatureStatistics`, and so on. Clients would then implement only the interfaces relevant to their needs.
*   **Default Methods (Java 8+):** While not ideal for every scenario, default methods can provide fallback implementations for less frequently used methods, reducing the burden on implementing classes.  However, overuse can obscure the interface's intent.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Consider using DTOs to encapsulate related data. The interface could then operate on these DTOs instead of exposing numerous individual getter methods.
*   **Consider if all the fields *need* to be directly accessible through an interface.** Perhaps some calculations or transformations should be encapsulated within the implementing class instead of exposed as direct getters.
