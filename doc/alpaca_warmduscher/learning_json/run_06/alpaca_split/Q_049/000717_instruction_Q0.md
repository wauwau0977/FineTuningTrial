You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This class, `MeteoDataMockImpl`, serves as a mock implementation of the `MeteoDataService` interface. It's designed to generate synthetic weather data for testing and development purposes when a real data source (like MeteoSwiss) isn't available or desired. The data generation is time-based, creating values that change over time, simulating a dynamic weather situation. This implementation is activated by a specific Spring profile (`SENSOR_MOCK`).

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataMockImpl.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoDataMockImpl`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Generates a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects containing mock weather data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** None directly. The data generation relies on system time.
    - **Outputs:** A `List<MeteoSwissEntity>` containing a single `MeteoSwissEntity` object with mock data.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Logs an informational message indicating mock data generation.
    2. Calculates a time difference (`dtS`) based on the current system time and a pre-defined starting time (`t0`).
    3. Creates a `MeteoSwissEntity` object.
    4. Sets the entity's attributes:
        - `createDate`: Set to the current date and time.
        - `stationName`: Set to "Kloten".
        - `stationId`: Set to "KLO".
        - `windMeasureDate`: Set to the current date and time.
        - `windGustSpeed`: Calculated based on `dtS`.
        - `temperatureMeasureDate`: Set to the current date and time.
        - `temperature`: Calculated based on `dtS`.
    5. Returns a `List` containing only this created `MeteoSwissEntity`.
- **External Interactions**:  None. It operates entirely in memory. Logging to SLF4J.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The code doesn't explicitly handle edge cases.  If `t0` is significantly in the future, `dtS` will be negative, resulting in negative temperature and wind speed. This is a potential issue if the starting time is not set correctly.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Data generation is expected to be very fast, as it's a simple in-memory calculation.  Response time should be negligible.
- **Scalability**: Not a major concern, as this is a mock implementation used primarily for testing.
- **Security**: No security considerations, as it doesn't interact with external systems or data.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Highly reliable as it's in-memory and doesn't depend on external resources.
- **Usability**: Easy to use for testing purposes, activated by the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components
- **`MeteoDataMockImpl` Class**: The main class implementing the `MeteoDataService` interface.
- **`getData()` Function**: Generates the mock `MeteoSwissEntity` data.
- **`init()` Function**:  Currently empty, but provides a place for potential initialization logic.
- **`t0` Variable**: Stores a timestamp used as a baseline for calculating time-based data values.
- **Important Logic Flow**: The `getData()` function calculates temperature and wind speed based on elapsed time since `t0`. This simulates a time-varying weather pattern.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: Part of the `thserver` module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- `java.util.List` - Used for returning the data.
- `java.util.Date` - Used for timestamping the data.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection and profile activation. Specifically, `@Component` and `@Profile` annotations.
- **SLF4J**: Used for logging informational messages.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.Profiles`**: Used for defining the Spring profile name.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.data.meteoswiss.MeteoDataService`**: The interface this class implements.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissEntity`**: The data class used to represent the weather data.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhanecments**: The code is already quite fast, so performance improvements aren't a priority.
- **Code Readability**: The code is relatively easy to read, but more descriptive variable names could improve clarity.
- **Security Improvements**: Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable.
- **Add Configuration**: Allow the baseline time `t0` to be configurable. This would allow for more controlled testing scenarios.
- **Randomization**: Introduce a degree of randomness in the generated data to make the mock data more realistic.
- **Error Handling**:  Add a check for negative `dtS` and handle it gracefully (e.g., logging a warning or setting default values).
- **More data points**: Return a list of multiple `MeteoSwissEntity` objects for a range of time.
