For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.html' with name 'overview-current.component.html' we have the following question: 
Describe the rendering logic for displaying temperature data within the `<mat-card-content>` section. Specifically, detail how the boiler temperature, outdoor temperature (both from `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity`), and their associated labels are structured and formatted using Angular's template syntax, including the use of `fxLayout`, `fxFlex`, `number` pipe, and the conditional display of the time.
