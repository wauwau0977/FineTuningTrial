The `CACHE_KEY_*` constants are string literals that serve as unique identifiers for different types of data cached by the `HeatingDataService`. They are used to store and retrieve data from the `cacheService`. This is a common caching pattern to avoid redundant HTTP requests to the server.

Specifically:

1. **Uniqueness:** Each constant represents a specific dataset (historical data, current data, meteo data, boiler stats, etc.). This ensures that different datasets are cached independently.
2. **Cache Retrieval:**  When a method like `getHistorical` is called, it uses the corresponding `CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL` to check if the data is already in the cache. If it is, the cached data is returned immediately, avoiding a network request.
3. **Cache Storage:** If the data is not in the cache, the method calls the `cacheService.get()` method. The `cacheService` then fetches the data from the server and stores it in the cache using the provided `CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL` as the key.
4. **Performance and Efficiency:** By caching data, the service reduces the number of HTTP requests to the backend server. This improves response times and reduces the load on the server. The `evictCache` parameter allows the caller to force a refresh of the cached data if needed.
