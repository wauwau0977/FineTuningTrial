I would focus on several strategies to optimize resource loading:

1.  **Prioritization with `rel="preload"`:** Critical fonts and icons should be preloaded using `<link rel="preload">`. This tells the browser to download them as early as possible, before they are discovered in the CSS or HTML. For example: `<link rel="preload" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500&amp;display=swap" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">`.  The `as="style"` attribute is crucial, and the `onload` ensures the stylesheet is only applied after loading, preventing flash of unstyled content.

2.  **HTTP/2:** Assuming the server supports HTTP/2, the browser can download multiple resources in parallel over a single connection, significantly reducing latency. This is the most impactful optimization if not already in place.

3.  **Font Display:** The `display` property on the font link (e.g., `display=swap`) is correctly used. This is good. It instructs the browser to use a fallback font while the custom font is loading, avoiding a blank screen.

4.  **Caching:** Ensure proper caching headers are set on the server for these resources (e.g., `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`). This allows the browser to cache these assets for a long period, reducing load times on subsequent visits.

5.  **Minification (if applicable):** While these are external resources, if we were handling icon fonts ourselves, we’d minimize the CSS/font file size.

6. **Resource Hints:**  Using `rel="preconnect"` on the fonts and potentially Google's domain can establish early connections, reducing DNS lookup and connection times.  This is already being done for `fonts.gstatic.com`, which is good.

I’d analyze the page load using tools like Chrome DevTools to identify the specific bottlenecks and prioritize these optimizations accordingly.
