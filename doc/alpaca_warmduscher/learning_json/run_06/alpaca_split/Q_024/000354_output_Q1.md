The nested structure within `.date-selector` (targeting `.mat-form-field` and `.mat-checkbox`) strongly suggests that `.date-selector` is a container component or a component that *composes* other Angular Material components. `.mat-form-field` and `.mat-checkbox` are both standard Angular Material components used for input and checkbox elements, respectively.

This approach aligns with the principles of component-based styling in Angular in several ways:

1. **Encapsulation (to a degree):** While these are not *child* components in the strict Angular sense, the `.date-selector` is styling specific Material components used *within* it. The styling is localized to this container.
2. **Composition:** The `.date-selector` component is composing other components (the Material components) to create a specific date selection interface.
3. **Styling Specificity:** The nested styles increase the specificity of the selectors, ensuring that these styles are applied to the Material components *within* the `.date-selector` container, and not unintentionally affecting other instances of those components elsewhere in the application.

However, it's important to note that styling Material components directly (rather than using theming or CSS variables) can sometimes lead to challenges when upgrading Angular Material or applying a different theme. The recommended approach is generally to leverage Angular Materialâ€™s theming capabilities to customize the appearance of these components in a more maintainable way.
