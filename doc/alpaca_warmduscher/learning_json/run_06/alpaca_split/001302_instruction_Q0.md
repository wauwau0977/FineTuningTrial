You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java configuration class, `DateTimeConfig`, is designed to configure date and time formatting within the `Warmduscher` application. It customizes how `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects are serialized and deserialized, ensuring consistent date/time handling throughout the application. It registers custom formatters for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` with the Spring `FormattingConversionService`, and it also configures a Jackson ObjectMapper to serialize dates in a specific format.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/DateTimeConfig.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `DateTimeConfig`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Configure date and time serialization/deserialization.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: No direct user input or output. The configuration impacts how data is processed and presented internally within the application.  The application provides date/time strings in ISO formats.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  Creates a `FormattingConversionService`.
    2.  Registers `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` to configure date and time formatting.
    3.  Registers custom formatters for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`.
    4. Configures Jackson ObjectMapper for serialization.
- **External Interactions**:
    -   Utilizes Spring Framework for configuration and bean management.
    -   Uses Jackson library for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    -   Handles potential `ParseException` when parsing date/time strings. The code assumes that input strings conform to the ISO date/time formats.  Invalid date strings will result in exceptions during parsing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The configuration should have minimal impact on application performance, as it primarily affects data formatting.
- **Scalability**: The configuration itself is not a scalability bottleneck.
- **Security**: No direct security implications.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to maintain.  The use of standard Spring configuration enhances maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The configuration does not directly affect application availability or reliability.
- **Usability**:  The configuration improves the usability of date/time data within the application by enforcing a consistent format.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`conversionService()`**: A bean method that creates and configures a `FormattingConversionService` for date/time formatting.  It registers a `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` to handle date and time conversion using ISO date and time formats.
- **`jsonCustomizer()`**: (Commented out in current code) This method would have customized the Jackson ObjectMapper for JSON serialization, allowing control over date formatting when creating JSON responses.
- **`localDateFormatter()`**: Creates a custom `Formatter` for `LocalDate`, handling parsing and printing of date values.
- **`localDateTimeFormatter()`**: Creates a custom `Formatter` for `LocalDateTime`, handling parsing and printing of date/time values.
- **`DateTimeFormatterRegistrar`**: Registers the custom `Formatter` instances with Spring's conversion service.
- **Error Handling**: `ParseException` is handled within the custom formatters.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web` package, which likely handles web-related configurations within the `Warmduscher` application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

-   Java 8+ (specifically, the `java.time` package for date and time handling)
-   Data structures: Lists, Maps, Sets (implicitly used by Spring Framework).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

-   **Spring Boot**: Used for auto-configuration, dependency injection, and bean management.
-   **Jackson**: Used for JSON serialization/deserialization. Specifically, `com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310` for handling JSR-310 date and time types.
- **Spring Context**: Used for the dependency injection and bean management,

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

-   No direct internal project dependencies are explicitly defined in this code. However, it likely depends on other classes within the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web` package and potentially other modules within the `Warmduscher` project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:**  The performance impact is minimal.
- **Code Readability**: The code is relatively readable. Consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each bean method.
- **Security Improvements**: No direct security risks.
- **Scalability Considerations**: No specific scalability concerns. However, ensure that the date/time formats are efficient for parsing and serialization, especially if the application handles a large volume of data.
- **Enable `jsonCustomizer()`**: Uncomment the `jsonCustomizer()` method and configure Jackson ObjectMapper for JSON serialization to have a consistent format across the application.
- **Configuration Properties**: Externalize the date/time formats using Spring configuration properties to allow for easy customization without code changes.
