For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.spec.ts' with name 'app.component.spec.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `it('should create the app', ...)` test case. Explain what it verifies, and what Angular testing methods are used. How does this simple test confirm a basic requirement of the application?
