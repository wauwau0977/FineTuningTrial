You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `HeatingDataPoller`, is a scheduled service responsible for periodically reading heating data from an external source (ModBus or MockService via `HeatingDataReadService`) and persisting it to the database using `HeatPumpRepository`. It provides a mechanism to regularly update heating pump data within the Warmduscher application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/HeatingDataPoller.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingDataPoller`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Poll heating data from an external source.
    - Persist the retrieved heating data to the database.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** Configuration property `thserver.pollingInterval` determines the polling frequency.
    - **Outputs:**  Logs information about successful data polling and persistence. Logs errors if data retrieval or persistence fails. Updates the database with `HeatPumpEntity` objects.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `pollData` method is triggered by the Spring scheduler based on the configured `thserver.pollingInterval`.
    2. The method calls `heatingDataReadService.getData()` to retrieve the latest heating data.
    3.  If data retrieval is successful, the retrieved `HeatPumpEntity` is saved to the database using `heatPumpRepository.save()`.
    4. The method logs a success message with the elapsed time.
    5. If an exception occurs during data retrieval, the exception is logged and re-thrown as a `RuntimeException`.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Interacts with `HeatingDataReadService` to read heating data.
    - Interacts with `HeatPumpRepository` to save heating data to the database.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - **Data Read Failure:** If `heatingDataReadService.getData()` throws an exception, the exception is logged, re-thrown, and handled by a higher-level error handler.
    - **Database Persistence Failure:**  The `heatPumpRepository.save()` method might throw exceptions (e.g., database connection issues). These are currently not explicitly handled within this class; they will propagate up the call stack.
    - **Invalid Configuration:**  The `thserver.pollingInterval` property, if invalid, may cause scheduling issues handled by Spring Boot.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The polling interval should be configurable to balance responsiveness and resource usage.  The polling operation should complete within a reasonable timeframe to avoid delays in data updates.
- **Scalability:** The polling mechanism should be designed to handle a growing number of heating pumps without significant performance degradation.  This is likely more dependent on the performance of the `HeatingDataReadService` and database.
- **Security:**  The interaction with the `HeatingDataReadService` and database should be secured appropriately.
- **Maintainability:** The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The polling mechanism should be robust and handle transient errors gracefully. Consider adding retry mechanisms or circuit breakers to improve resilience.
- **Usability:**  The polling interval is configurable through a property, making it easy to adjust the polling frequency without code changes.

## 5. Key Components

- **`pollData()` Function:** The main method executed by the scheduler. It reads data, persists it, and logs results.
- **`heatingDataReadService`:**  An injected service responsible for retrieving heating data from an external source.
- **`heatPumpRepository`:** An injected repository responsible for interacting with the database.
- **Error Handling:** Catches exceptions during data retrieval and re-throws them as `RuntimeException`.
- **Logging:** Uses SLF4J to log information and errors.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures:** Uses basic data structures implicitly through the Spring framework and data entities.
- **Exception Handling:**  Uses `try-catch` blocks for error handling.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework:** Utilizes Springâ€™s dependency injection, scheduling (`@Scheduled`), and component annotation (`@Component`).
- **SLF4J:**  Used for logging.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.HeatPumpRepository`**:  Interface for database interactions.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.HeatPumpEntity`**:  Data entity representing heating pump data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.device.service.HeatingDataReadService`**: Service to read heating data from the external source.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Analyze the performance of `heatingDataReadService` to identify potential bottlenecks.
    - Consider asynchronous processing of data polling to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Code Readability:**
    - The code is already reasonably readable. No immediate changes needed.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Ensure secure communication with the `HeatingDataReadService` and database.
    - Consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms if necessary.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    -  Investigate the scalability of `HeatingDataReadService` and the database.
    - Consider using a message queue to decouple the polling process from the data persistence process. This would allow the application to handle a higher volume of data.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling with retry mechanisms or circuit breakers to handle transient errors and prevent cascading failures.  Consider logging more detailed error information.
