```typescript
it('should initialize appVersion correctly', () => {
  fixture.detectChanges(); // Ensure component is initialized and change detection runs
  expect(component.appVersion).toBe('1.0.0');
});
```

Explanation:

1.  **`fixture.detectChanges();`**: This is crucial. It ensures that the component's constructor is called and the `appVersion` property is initialized before the assertion.
2.  **`expect(component.appVersion).toBe('1.0.0');`**: This assertion verifies that the value of the `appVersion` property on the component instance (`component`) is equal to the expected value ("1.0.0"). `toBe()` performs a strict equality check (===).
