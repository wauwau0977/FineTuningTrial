The implication of creating new `Date()` objects each time `emptyInstance()` is called is that `measurementDateStart` and `measurementDateEnd` will always represent the *current* date and time when the method is invoked. This can lead to problems in several scenarios:

*   **Comparisons:** If you are comparing instances created by `emptyInstance()` with other `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` objects containing specific dates, the comparisons will likely fail because the dates will almost always be different.  This could lead to unexpected behavior in logic that relies on date equality.
*   **Long-Term Data Storage:** If you store multiple instances created with `emptyInstance()`, they wonâ€™t represent a consistent "empty" timeframe. Each instance will have a different timestamp. This makes it difficult to identify or filter for truly empty records.
*   **Testing:** Tests that rely on comparing the dates within the `emptyInstance()` will be flaky and unreliable because the dates will change with each execution.

A better approach would be to define a fixed, known `Date` object to use for the "empty" instances. This could be done by defining a constant outside the class, or within a static field.

Example:

```typescript
private static readonly EMPTY_DATE = new Date('1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'); // or any other meaningful default date

static emptyInstance() {
   return new SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity(SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.EMPTY_DATE, SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.EMPTY_DATE, 0, 0, 0, false, 0);
 }
```

This ensures that all `emptyInstance()` creations will have the same, predictable date values, making comparisons and data storage more reliable.
