For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java'... 
Assume the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method is implemented as follows:

```java
public static double calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation(double temperature, double humidity) {
    return (0.621945 * (humidity / 100) * (273.15 / (temperature + 273.15)));
}
```

Considering this implementation, what potential edge cases or boundary conditions might this method *not* handle correctly, and how could these be tested?
