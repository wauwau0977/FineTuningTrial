Defining `UnsafeRunnable` as an interface directly promotes loose coupling. Loose coupling means minimizing dependencies between different parts of a system. Here's how:

1. **Contract, Not Implementation:** The interface defines a *contract* – it specifies *what* a runnable task should do (implement the `run()` method), but not *how* it should do it.  This allows different classes to implement the `UnsafeRunnable` interface in their own way, without affecting other parts of the system that rely on the interface.
2. **Dependency Inversion Principle:** The interface enables the Dependency Inversion Principle – high-level modules (the code that uses `UnsafeRunnable`) should not depend on low-level modules (the concrete implementations of `run()`). Instead, both should depend on abstractions (the `UnsafeRunnable` interface).

Compared to using an abstract class, there are specific benefits:

1. **Multiple Inheritance (of Behavior):** Interfaces allow a class to implement multiple interfaces, inheriting multiple behaviors. Abstract classes, in Java, only allow single inheritance.
2. **Flexibility:** Interfaces are more flexible because they don’t contain any implementation details. This promotes a cleaner separation of concerns and allows for more customization.
3. **Simplicity:** In this case, there's no need for an abstract class to provide any common implementation. The only requirement is to define a runnable task. An interface is sufficient and keeps the design simple.  An abstract class would introduce unnecessary complexity.
4. **Testability:** Using an interface makes testing easier because you can easily mock or stub the interface to isolate the code being tested.
