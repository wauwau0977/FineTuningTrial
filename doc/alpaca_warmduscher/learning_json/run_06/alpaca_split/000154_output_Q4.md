```typescript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {interval} from "rxjs";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
import {HeatingDataService} from "./heating-data.service";

@Component({
 selector: 'app-root',
 templateUrl: './app.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
})
export class AppComponent {
 title = 'thserver-client';

 constructor() {
   console.log("Setup the page refresh mechanism all " + environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds + " seconds.");
   // figure out a client id
 }

 myFullPageRefresh(): void {
   window.location.reload();
 }

 subscribe = interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000).subscribe(
   val => {
     console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")
     this.myFullPageRefresh();
   }
 );
}
```

The `AppComponent` class is the root component of the Angular application. Its primary function, as demonstrated in the provided code, is to implement a full-page refresh mechanism at a configurable interval.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **`environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds`:** This variable, imported from the `../environments/environment` file, defines the frequency of the full-page refresh in seconds. It's a configuration value that allows the refresh interval to be easily changed without modifying the component's code.

2.  **`interval` from `rxjs`:** The `interval` operator from the RxJS library is used to create an observable that emits values at a specified time interval. In this case, `interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000)` creates an observable that emits a value every `environment.fullPageRefreshInSconnds` seconds (converted to milliseconds).

3.  **`myFullPageRefresh()`:** This method simply reloads the current page using `window.location.reload()`. This forces a complete refresh of the application.

4.  **Subscription and Lifecycle:**  The `subscribe` property of the `AppComponent` holds the subscription to the `interval` observable. The `subscribe` method is called during the component's initialization. The callback function within the `subscribe` method (`val => { ... }`) is executed every time the `interval` observable emits a value. Inside the callback, `console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")` logs a message to the console, and then `this.myFullPageRefresh()` is called to perform the full-page reload.  The component doesn't explicitly unsubscribe, meaning the refresh continues indefinitely as long as the component remains active.
