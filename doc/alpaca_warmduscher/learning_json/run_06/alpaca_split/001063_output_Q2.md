The code is functional but can be improved for readability and maintainability.  The main issue is the repeated calculation of `dtS / 30`.  Here's how to refactor it:

1.  **Introduce a local variable:**  Calculate `dtS / 30` once and store it in a local variable.

```java
@Override
public HeatPumpEntity getData() throws Exception {
    double dtS = (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0) / 1000;
    double tempFactor = dtS / 30;

    HeatPumpEntity ret = new HeatPumpEntity();
    ret.setHeatingIn(tempFactor + 20);
    ret.setHeatingOut(tempFactor + 30);
    ret.setSoleIn(tempFactor + 10);
    ret.setSoleOut(tempFactor + 5);
    ret.setBoilerTemp(tempFactor + 30);

    log.info("Return " + ret);
    return ret;
}
```

**Benefits of this refactoring:**

*   **Readability:** It makes the code easier to understand because the repeated calculation is removed.
*   **Maintainability:** If the calculation `dtS / 30` needs to be changed, it only needs to be updated in one place.
*   **Potential Performance Improvement:** Although likely negligible in this case, avoiding redundant calculations can improve performance.
*   **Reduced Risk of Errors:** Less repetition reduces the chance of making a mistake when modifying the code.

This small change significantly improves the overall quality of the code without altering its functionality.
