You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the `HeatingEntity` class, a data model representing heating system measurements. The class stores various temperature readings, operational hours, and digital input statuses. It provides methods to create instances from scratch, generate an empty instance, and populate instances from web service data. The primary purpose is to encapsulate and organize heating data for use within the Warmduscher application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/heatingEntity.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Store heating system data.
    - Create a new `HeatingEntity` instance.
    - Create an empty `HeatingEntity` instance with default values.
    - Create a `HeatingEntity` instance from web service data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**
        - Constructor parameters: `id`, `measurementDate`, `boilerTemp`, `boilerTempMin`, `boilerTempMax`, `compressorHours`, `heatingIn`, `heatingInMin`, `heatingInMax`, `heatingOut`, `heatingOutMin`, `heatingOutMax`, `soleIn`, `soleInMin`, `soleInMax`, `soleOut`, `soleOutMin`, `soleOutMax`, `ireg300TempOutdoor`, `ireg300TempOutdoorMin`, `ireg300TempOutdoorMax`, `di1Error`, `di10Compressor1`, `di14PumpDirect`, `di15PumpBoiler`, `di17BoilerEl`, `di21PumpPrimary`, `di22pumpLoad`, `di70PumpHk1`, `di71Hkm1ixOpen`, `di72Hkm1ixClose`.
        - Web service data (object containing the above data).
    - **Outputs:**
        - A `HeatingEntity` instance populated with the provided data.
        - An empty `HeatingEntity` instance with default values.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    - **Constructor:** Initializes the `HeatingEntity` with the provided parameters.
    - **`emptyInstance()`:** Creates and returns a new `HeatingEntity` with null or zero values for all properties.
    - **`ofWebService(data)`:** 
        - Checks if the provided `data` is null. If so, returns an `emptyInstance()`.
        - If `data` is not null, creates a new `HeatingEntity` instance and populates its properties with the corresponding values from the `data` object.  It uses `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` to convert the `measurementDate` string to a Date object.
- **External Interactions:**
    -  Calls `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` to convert the `measurementDate` from a web service response to a Date object.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - `ofWebService()` handles null or undefined web service data by returning an empty instance.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  Creation of an instance should be very fast, as it's primarily data storage.  No complex computations are performed.
- **Scalability:**  The class itself is not a scalability bottleneck. Scalability depends on the overall system architecture and the data source.
- **Security:** The class doesn't directly handle security.  Data security depends on how the data is transmitted and stored.
- **Maintainability:** The class is relatively simple and easy to understand and modify. The properties are clearly named.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The class is reliable as it is a simple data container. Availability depends on the system it's integrated into.
- **Usability:** The class is easy to use as it provides a constructor and a factory method for creating instances.
- **Compliance:** Not applicable.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - **`constructor(parameters)`:** Initializes the `HeatingEntity` with provided data.
    - **`emptyInstance()`:** Creates an instance with default/empty values.
    - **`ofWebService(data)`:** Creates an instance from a web service data object.
- **Important logic flows:**
    - The `ofWebService()` method includes a null check to handle potentially missing web service data.
- **Error handling:**
    - Handles missing web service data by returning an empty instance.
- **Classes:** No subclasses defined.
- **Modules:**  Part of the `app.entities` module within the Warmduscher application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures:** Uses primitive data types (string, number, Date).
- **Date Objects**:  Utilizes JavaScript Date objects for handling measurement dates.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **None directly.** The class is vanilla TypeScript and doesn't directly depend on external libraries.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`HeatingDataService`**:  Used for converting the date received from the web service.  (specifically the `convertDate` function)

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** The class is already performant due to its simplicity. No significant improvements are expected.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable. The class doesn't directly handle security-sensitive data.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The class is not a scalability bottleneck. Focus on scaling the data source and the overall application architecture.
- **Consider Using Interfaces/Types**: For larger applications, define an interface or type for the structure of the web service data to enforce data consistency and improve type safety. This would make the code more robust.
- **Input Validation**: While not essential, consider adding input validation to the constructor to ensure the data being stored is valid (e.g., checking the date format). This can help prevent errors later in the application.
