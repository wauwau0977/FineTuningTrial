This code snippet demonstrates dependency injection. The `SessionRequestRepository` is injected into the `MyRequestInterceptor` class through its constructor. This allows the interceptor to interact with a database to save session request data. Dependency injection promotes loose coupling, making the code more testable, maintainable, and flexible. Instead of the interceptor creating its own `SessionRequestRepository` instance, it receives one from an external source (like a Spring container). This allows for easy swapping of implementations (e.g., for testing with a mock repository) without modifying the interceptor's code.
