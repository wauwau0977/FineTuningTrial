The `273.15` constant is used to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.  The formula for calculating absolute humidity, as implemented here, relies on absolute temperature units (Kelvin) for accurate results.  Adding `273.15` ensures that the temperature is expressed in Kelvin, aligning with the physics of the calculation. The vapor pressure calculations within the formula are temperature-dependent and fundamentally rely on an absolute temperature scale. Without this conversion, the calculated absolute humidity would be significantly inaccurate.
