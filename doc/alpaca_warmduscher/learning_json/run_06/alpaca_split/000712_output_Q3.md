The import statement `import com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissEntity;` makes the `MeteoSwissEntity` class available for use within the `MeteoDataService` interface.  It indicates that the interface will work with objects of the `MeteoSwissEntity` type.

`MeteoSwissEntity` likely represents a data model or entity class. It probably defines the structure of the meteorological data retrieved from the MeteoSwiss data source.  This entity likely contains fields representing parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, timestamp, and potentially location information. 

The `getData()` method in the interface returns a `List<MeteoSwissEntity>`, which means it is intended to provide a collection of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects, each representing a single set of meteorological data retrieved from MeteoSwiss.
