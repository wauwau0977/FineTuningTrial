With `windGustSpeed` and `windDirection` being of type `Double`, there are a few potential issues to consider when mapping to a DTO using a mapping framework:

1.  **Null Handling:** `Double` is an object type, so it can be `null`.  Mapping frameworks might handle `null` values differently depending on the configuration. If the DTO field is a primitive `double`, a `NullPointerException` could occur during mapping. The framework needs to be configured to handle `null` `Double` values appropriately, perhaps by providing a default value or skipping the mapping.

2. **Precision:** Mapping frameworks may have default precision settings for numeric types. This might lead to rounding or truncation of the `Double` value during mapping, potentially impacting the accuracy of the data in the DTO.  Configuration may be needed to specify the desired precision.

3. **Default Values:** If a `windGustSpeed` or `windDirection` value isn't set on the entity, it will be `null`.  The DTO might have a default value for these fields.  The mapping framework should be configured to handle this appropriately - whether to use the default value or map the `null` value.

4.  **Type Mismatch:** If the DTO field is not of type `Double` (e.g., a `float` or `Integer`), the mapping framework might perform an implicit type conversion, which could lead to data loss or unexpected behavior.

To avoid these issues, explicitly configure the mapping framework to handle `null` values, specify the desired precision, and ensure that the DTO field is of the correct type. Using custom converters in the mapping framework would also provide fine-grained control over the mapping process.
