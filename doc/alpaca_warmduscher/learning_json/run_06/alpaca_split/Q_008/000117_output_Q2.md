The likely intention of the commented-out code was to visually indicate the hover state of a button and/or the active state of a link within the toolbar. The intention was to change the text color to `blueviolet` on hover or when the link is currently selected.

Several considerations might have led to it being commented out:

1.  **Conflicts with existing styles**: The `blueviolet` color might clash with other parts of the application’s color scheme or existing styles on the button.

2.  **Incomplete Implementation**: The `.active-link` selector suggests there might be a concept of active links within the toolbar, but the logic to dynamically apply the `.active-link` class may not have been fully implemented or tested.

3.  **Accessibility Concerns**:  A simple color change on hover/active may not provide sufficient visual contrast for users with visual impairments.  Accessibility guidelines recommend using more than just color to indicate state changes.

4.  **Refactoring/Experimentation**: The code could have been part of an experiment that was abandoned or a refactoring effort where the desired styling approach changed.

Re-enabling this code without further review could have the following implications:

*   **Unexpected Visual Changes**: The `blueviolet` color might unexpectedly disrupt the application’s established visual language.
*   **Accessibility Issues**: If the color contrast is insufficient, it could make the toolbar less usable for visually impaired users.
*   **Broken Functionality**: If the `.active-link` class isn’t correctly applied, the active state indication might not work as expected.
*   **Potential CSS Specificity Issues**:  The re-enabled rules might be overridden by other, more specific CSS rules.

A thorough review, including testing with accessibility tools and consideration of the overall application’s design, would be necessary before re-enabling this code.
