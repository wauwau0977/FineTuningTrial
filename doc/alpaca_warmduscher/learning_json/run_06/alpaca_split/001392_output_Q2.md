The `@ResponseBody` annotation instructs Spring to take the return value of the `send` method and write it directly to the HTTP response body. In essence, it signifies that the method's return value is the actual content that should be sent back to the client. Spring then uses appropriate message converters (based on content negotiation) to serialize the return value (in this case, a `String`) into a format that can be sent over the network (e.g., plain text, JSON).

If the `@ResponseBody` annotation were removed, the behavior of the method would change significantly. Instead of writing the returned `String` directly to the response body, Spring would interpret the method's return value as a view name. It would then attempt to resolve a view with that name and render it, assuming a view resolver is configured in the Spring application context.

Specifically, the following would happen:

1. **View Resolution:** Spring would try to find a view (e.g., a JSP, Thymeleaf template, or FreeMarker template) with the name "mailSend.send(subject, content)". Since this is almost certainly not a valid view name, the application would likely throw an exception (e.g., `NoSuchViewException`) indicating that the specified view could not be found.

2. **HTTP Response:**  Even if a view with that name *did* exist, the HTTP response would be rendered as HTML (or whatever format the view is designed to produce), not as plain text.  This is almost certainly not the desired behavior.

In essence, removing `@ResponseBody` would transform the method from a simple API endpoint that returns data to a controller method that attempts to render a view, likely leading to an error if the view doesn't exist. The client would receive an HTML error page (or whatever the view renderer produces) instead of the expected String response.
