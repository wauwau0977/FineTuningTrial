You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component (`boiler-chart.component.ts`) is responsible for generating various charts related to heating system data, outdoor temperature, and wind conditions. It defines multiple Highcharts options configurations for different chart types (area charts, line charts, etc.).  The data displayed in these charts comes from different sources including internal heating system metrics and external weather data (MeteoSchweiz). The component aims to visualize historical and current data for monitoring and analysis.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerChartComponent` (implied, although not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet - the code defines configuration *options* for this component)

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Define configurations for various Highcharts to display heating data, outdoor temperature, and wind conditions.
    - Configure chart properties such as type, colors, data series, axes, tooltips, and legends.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** Data series (e.g., `heatingInTempMinMax`, `heatingOutTempMinMax`, `outdoorTempAverage`) are presumably passed into the component (not visible in this snippet).
    - **Outputs:** Highcharts option configurations which are used by the `BoilerChartComponent` to render the charts on the UI.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    - The component defines multiple `chartOptions` objects, each representing a specific chart.
    - Each `chartOptions` object configures the chart's appearance and data series.
    - The `chartOptions` are likely used by a Highcharts library instance within the `BoilerChartComponent` to render the charts.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Data Sources:** The component relies on data sources for various metrics:
        - Internal heating system data (e.g., return and supply temperatures, delta temperatures, compressor hours).
        - External weather data from MeteoSchweiz (outdoor temperature, wind speed).
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    -  Handles missing data by configuring charts with `min: null` and `max: null` on axes.
    -  Includes settings like `noData` and `loading` in `lang` for handling cases when data is unavailable.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Charts should render quickly and smoothly, even with a large amount of historical data.
- **Scalability:** The chart configurations should be able to handle a growing volume of data without significant performance degradation.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured and documented to facilitate future modifications and enhancements.
- **Reliability & Availability:** Charts should be consistently displayed and updated with accurate data.
- **Usability:** Charts should be visually appealing and easy to interpret.
- **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to data privacy regulations when handling personal data from weather data sources.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - The code snippet primarily consists of object definitions (Highcharts options). There are no explicit functions defined within this snippet.
- **Important Logic Flows:**
    - The logic flow revolves around configuring each chart type with its specific options.
- **Error Handling:**
    - The component includes empty `lang` settings (`noData`, `loading`) to handle the cases where data is unavailable.
- **Classes:** The code defines configurations for a class, namely `BoilerChartComponent`.
- **Modules:** The component itself constitutes a module for chart visualizations within the application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript:** Used for static typing and code organization.
- **Object Literals:** Used to define the Highcharts option configurations.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Highcharts:** Used for creating interactive charts and visualizations.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- Presumably other components within the `Warmduscher` project provide the data that is visualized by these charts (e.g. data retrieval components, service components).

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Implement data aggregation or filtering to reduce the amount of data loaded and rendered in the charts.
    - Explore using Highcharts' data grouping and buffering features to improve performance with large datasets.
- **Code Readability:**
    - Consider refactoring the chart options into separate files or modules to improve code organization and maintainability.
    - Add more comments to explain the purpose of each chart option and its configuration.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Validate and sanitize data received from external sources (MeteoSchweiz) to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on data sources.
    - Consider using a more scalable data storage solution for storing historical data.
