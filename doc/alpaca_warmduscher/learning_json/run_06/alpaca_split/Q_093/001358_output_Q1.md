Currently, the response construction is somewhat procedural â€“ creating objects (`GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage`, `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText`) and setting their properties manually. This can become cumbersome and less readable as the complexity of the response increases.

A more streamlined or declarative approach could involve:

1.  **Using a Builder Pattern:** While still object-oriented, a builder pattern can encapsulate the response creation logic into a separate class, providing a fluent API for constructing the response. This improves readability and reduces boilerplate code.

2.  **Using a Configuration/Template Approach:**  Define response templates or configurations (e.g., in a YAML or JSON file) that specify the structure and content of the response. The code would then load the template and populate it with dynamic data.

3.  **Utilizing a Dedicated Response Object:**  Create a custom response object that encapsulates all the response data. The code would then create an instance of this object, populate its fields, and use it to construct the `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse`.

**Benefits of a different approach:**

*   **Readability:**  A declarative or builder-based approach can make the response construction logic easier to understand and follow.
*   **Maintainability:**  Changes to the response structure or content can be made more easily by modifying the template or builder class, rather than scattered throughout the code.
*   **Testability:**  A separate builder or template class can be unit tested in isolation, ensuring that the response is constructed correctly.  It's easier to mock and verify the creation of the response.
*   **Reduced Code Duplication:** A builder pattern or template approach can centralize the response construction logic, eliminating code duplication and making it easier to maintain consistency across different parts of the application.

For example, using a simple builder:

```java
public class DialogflowResponseBuilder {
    private String fulfillmentText;

    public DialogflowResponseBuilder withFulfillmentText(String text) {
        this.fulfillmentText = text;
        return this;
    }

    public GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse build() {
        GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse response = new GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse();
        GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage msg = new GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage();
        GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText text = new GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText();
        text.setText(List.of(fulfillmentText));
        msg.setText(text);
        response.setFulfillmentMessages(List.of(msg));
        return response;
    }
}

// Inside the webhook method:
DialogflowResponseBuilder builder = new DialogflowResponseBuilder()
    .withFulfillmentText("Boiler Temperatur ist " + heatPumpDataService.getCurrent().getBoilerTemp());
GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse response = builder.build();
```
This simplifies the response creation and makes it more readable and maintainable.
