The `@RequestMapping("/send")` annotation maps the HTTP request path `/send` to the `send` method.  This means that when a client sends an HTTP request to `/send`, this `send` method will be executed. It essentially defines the URL endpoint.

The `@ResponseBody` annotation indicates that the return value of the `send` method should be written directly to the body of the HTTP response.  In this case, the `send` method returns a `String`, which will be sent back to the client as the response body. Without `@ResponseBody`, the return value would typically be interpreted as a view name (e.g., a template to render), not the response content itself.

Together, these annotations create a RESTful endpoint. A client can send a request to `/send` with optional `subject` and `content` parameters (using a GET or POST request), and the `send` method will use the `MailSend` service to send an email and return a string (likely representing the success or failure status, or a message) as the response.
