Relying on an external service (`HeatingDataService`) for data conversion within the entity class introduces several potential issues. It creates a dependency, making the `MeteoSwissEntity` less self-contained and harder to test in isolation. The conversion logic is hidden within the service, potentially making it difficult to understand how dates are being transformed. Changes to the `HeatingDataService` could inadvertently break the entity class.

To improve the design, I'd advocate for moving the date conversion logic *into* the `MeteoSwissEntity` class itself, or at least providing a way to pass in a date conversion function as a parameter to `ofWebService()`. This would make the entity more resilient to changes in the service and easier to unit test. Alternatively, you could use a dedicated data transfer object (DTO) for incoming data from the web service, and perform all conversions *before* creating the `MeteoSwissEntity` instance.
