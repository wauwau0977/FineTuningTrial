You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code provides a utility class, `Physics`, containing a single static method, `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation`, for approximating absolute humidity based on temperature and relative humidity.  It uses a standard formula to convert these two values into an absolute humidity value (grams/m³). The method is a static utility, intended for use without instantiation of the `Physics` class.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Physics.java
- **Class Name(s):** `Physics`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Calculate approximate absolute humidity given temperature and relative humidity.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**:
        - `temperature` (double): Temperature in Celsius (°C).
        - `relativeHumidity` (double): Relative humidity as a percentage (0-100).
    - **Output**:
        - (double): Approximate absolute humidity in grams per cubic meter (g/m³).
- **Workflow/Logic**: The `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method applies a specific formula to calculate absolute humidity, as described in the code's documentation (and sourced from the provided URL). The formula calculates the saturation vapor pressure based on temperature, then scales it by the relative humidity to determine absolute humidity.
- **External Interactions**: None. This class is self-contained and does not interact with any external systems (databases, APIs, files, etc.).
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Temperature:** While not explicitly handled, very low temperatures might lead to potential issues with the exponential calculation.  This isn’t addressed within the code.
    - **Relative Humidity:** Input values outside the range of 0-100 are not validated.  The formula may still produce a result, but it will not be physically meaningful.
    - **Division by Zero:** The denominator `(273.15 + temperature)` will prevent division by zero.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The calculation is relatively simple and should execute quickly.  Performance is not a critical concern for this isolated function.
- **Scalability**: The function is stateless and does not rely on any shared resources, making it highly scalable.
- **Security**: No security considerations apply to this class.
- **Maintainability**: The code is short and well-commented, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The code's reliability depends on the accuracy of the implemented formula.
- **Usability**: Easy to use. A single static method simplifies integration into other components.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements apply.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation(double temperature, double relativeHumidity)`: Calculates the approximate absolute humidity based on the provided temperature and relative humidity.
- **Important logic flows**: The method directly applies the formula to calculate absolute humidity.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling is present. Input validation isn't implemented.
- **Classes**: The class is a simple utility class without subclasses.
- **Modules**: The code is self-contained within the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- `Math.exp()`: Used for calculating the exponential function.
- `double` primitive type: Used for numeric calculations.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None. This class has no dependencies on other parts of the project.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhanecements:** No significant performance improvements are expected given the simplicity of the calculations.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already relatively readable.
- **Security Improvements:** No security risks are present.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The current design is already scalable.
- **Input Validation:** Add input validation to ensure that temperature and relative humidity values are within reasonable ranges. This would prevent unexpected results or errors.
- **Exception Handling:** Consider throwing exceptions for invalid inputs instead of returning potentially meaningless results.
- **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of the calculation for various input values and ensure the code behaves as expected.
- **Constants:** Define the magic numbers (6.112, 17.67, 243.5, 2.1674, 273.15) as named constants to improve readability and maintainability.
