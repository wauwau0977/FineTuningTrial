For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
   default String getId() {
       return UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID();
   }
```
What is the purpose of the `default` keyword used in conjunction with the `getId()` method, and what does this suggest about how the ID will be handled by implementing classes?
