For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java' with name 'UnsafeRunnable.java'... 
Why might an interface like this be named 'UnsafeRunnable'? What kind of operations or scenarios might necessitate such a design that explicitly acknowledges a potential safety concern?
