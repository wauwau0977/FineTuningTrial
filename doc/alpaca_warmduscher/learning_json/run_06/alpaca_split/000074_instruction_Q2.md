For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/test.ts' with name 'test.ts'... 
Assume you want to add logging to this `test.ts` file, specifically to log when a test file is loaded. How would you modify the code to achieve this, and where would you place the logging statement to ensure itâ€™s executed for each loaded test file?
