These two `if` statements implement validation logic for the `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows` parameters in the `getBetweenDates` method.  They ensure that the method receives valid limiting criteria for the data retrieval.

*   The first `if` statement (`if (groupEveryNthSecond > 0 && maxRows > 0)`) checks if both `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows` are positive. If this is true, it means both parameters are supplied, which is not allowed. In this case, a `ThException` is thrown, indicating that either `groupEveryNthSecond` or `maxRows` should be used, but not both.

*   The second `if` statement (`if (groupEveryNthSecond < 0 && maxRows < 0)`) checks if both `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows` are negative. Since the default values are -1, this means that neither parameter was explicitly supplied.  If this is true, it means that no limiting criteria was provided, which is also not allowed. In this case, a `ThException` is thrown, indicating that at least one of the parameters must be supplied.

In essence, the code enforces a mutually exclusive requirement: either the data should be limited by a fixed interval (`groupEveryNthSecond`) or by a maximum number of rows (`maxRows`), but not both, and at least one of them needs to be defined.
