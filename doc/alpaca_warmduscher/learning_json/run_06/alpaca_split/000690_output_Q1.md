The `meteoDataService.init()` call within the constructor is likely used to initialize the `MeteoDataService` instance. This could involve establishing connections to external services, loading configuration data, or performing any other setup required before fetching meteorological data.

Benefits:

*   **Early Initialization:** Ensures that the `MeteoDataService` is properly initialized as soon as the `MeteoDataPoller` is created, avoiding potential issues during the first execution of `pollData()`.
*   **Centralized Initialization:** Keeps the initialization logic contained within the `MeteoDataService`, promoting modularity and code organization.

Drawbacks:

*   **Startup Delay:** The initialization process might add to the overall application startup time. If the initialization is resource-intensive or involves network calls, it could significantly delay the application becoming fully operational.
*   **Tight Coupling:** Directly calling `init()` in the constructor creates a tight coupling between `MeteoDataPoller` and the internal initialization logic of `MeteoDataService`.
* **Dependency on Service**: If `init()` fails, the entire application startup might fail.

Consider alternatives like lazy initialization or using Spring's `@PostConstruct` annotation within `MeteoDataService` to defer initialization until the application context is fully initialized, potentially reducing startup time and improving resilience. Also consider if initialization can be made idempotent to handle potential failures during startup.
