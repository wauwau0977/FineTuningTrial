Storing the `mailPassword` directly in the application's configuration, even if encrypted, is a significant security risk. If the configuration file is compromised (through a server breach, accidental exposure in source control, etc.), an attacker gains immediate access to the email account. This allows for sending malicious emails, data exfiltration, or further attacks on the system.

A more secure alternative is to use a dedicated secrets management system, such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or a similar service. This involves:

1.  **Storing the password in the secrets manager:**  Instead of the application.properties, the `mailPassword` is securely stored in the secrets manager.
2.  **Application retrieves secret at runtime:** The `MailSend` class would need to be modified to authenticate with the secrets manager (using appropriate credentials and permissions) and retrieve the `mailPassword` at runtime, only when needed to send an email.
3.  **Avoid caching:** Minimize or eliminate caching of the password within the application to reduce the window of opportunity for compromise.
4.  **Least Privilege:**  The application should only have the necessary permissions to retrieve the specific secret (password) it needs, minimizing the blast radius if compromised.
5.  **Rotation:** Implement a mechanism to regularly rotate (change) the email password and update the secret in the secrets manager.

This approach significantly enhances security by isolating the sensitive password from the application code and configuration, reducing the risk of exposure and unauthorized access.
