Including the URL and accuracy claim is crucial for several reasons, and significantly contributes to code quality and maintainability.

*   **Source and Validation:** The URL provides a source for the formula used. This allows other developers (or future you) to verify the formula's correctness and understand its derivation.
*   **Accuracy Information:** Specifying the accuracy (within 0.1% over a specified temperature range) provides essential information about the limitations of the calculation.  This is critical for understanding the validity of the results in different scenarios.
*   **Maintainability:** If the formula needs to be updated or changed in the future, the URL provides a starting point for researching alternative or improved calculations.
*   **Documentation:** It serves as a form of inline documentation, explaining *why* a particular formula was chosen and its known limitations.
*   **Trust and Reliability:** It enhances the trustworthiness of the code by demonstrating that the calculations are based on established scientific principles.

Essentially, it transforms the code from a "black box" calculation into a well-documented and verifiable process.
