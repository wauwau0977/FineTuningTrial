}
```

To implement the `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` interface robustly, I would choose the following internal field types:

*   **`private Integer dayOfWeekStartingMonday;`**:  `Integer` is appropriate. The interface specifies an integer, and we can initialize this field to `null` if, for some reason, a day of the week cannot be determined.  Although unlikely, this provides graceful handling of unexpected data.  The getter would handle the `null` case, possibly returning a default value or throwing an exception.

*   **`private String dayOfWeekText;`**: `String` is appropriate.  It could be initialized to an empty string (`""`) or `null`. The getter method would handle the `null` or empty case by returning a default value like "Unknown Day" to prevent errors in the UI or reports.

*   **`private Double sumBoilerDiffDecrease;`**: `Double` is appropriate.  In cases where there are *no* sensor readings for a particular day, the sum should be initialized to `0.0` rather than `null` to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` during calculations. This handles the case of missing data gracefully.

*   **`private Double sumBoilerDiffIncrease;`**: `Double` is appropriate. Similar to `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, initialize to `0.0` if no readings are available.

*   **`private Long numOfStatisticRecords1;`**: `Long` is appropriate.  Initialize to `0L` if no statistics records are found for that day.  Using `0L` instead of `null` is crucial to avoid exceptions when performing calculations that require the number of records.

**Justification:**

The choice of using primitive wrappers (Integer, Double, Long) instead of their primitive counterparts (int, double, long) allows for representing missing or undefined data with `null`. This is important for handling real-world sensor data which is often incomplete or subject to errors. The getter methods would then need to handle the `null` values appropriately, providing default values or throwing exceptions as needed.  The `0.0` and `0L` initializations are to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` in calculations and to ensure calculations operate meaningfully even with sparse data.
