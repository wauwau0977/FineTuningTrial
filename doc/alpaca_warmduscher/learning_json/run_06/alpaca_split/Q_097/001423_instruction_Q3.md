For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/InfoService.java' with name 'InfoService.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/info")
public class InfoService {
   // ... method implementations ...
}
```
How do the `@Controller` and `@RequestMapping("/info")` annotations work together to define the scope and purpose of this class within a Spring application?
