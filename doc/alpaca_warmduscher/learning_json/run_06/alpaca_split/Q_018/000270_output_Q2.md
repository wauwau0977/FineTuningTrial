The `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method aims to determine a suitable time interval for data collection, given a maximum number of data points to collect within a specific time range. It takes `maxDataPoints`, `start` and `end` dates as input.

The method calculates the time difference (`deltaInSeconds`) between the `start` and `end` dates. It then divides this time difference by `maxDataPoints` to get the `desiredInterval`.  The code then iterates through a pre-defined list of `Interval` objects (`UtilsServiceService.getStandardIntervals()`), starting from the smallest interval. It returns the first interval in the list whose `intervalInSeconds` value is *greater* than the calculated `desiredInterval`.  This ensures that the selected interval is large enough to avoid exceeding the `maxDataPoints` limit, while still being as small as possible.

Edge cases and handling:

*   **Invalid Dates:** If either `start` or `end` is null or undefined, the method immediately returns the smallest predefined `Interval` ( `intervals[0]` which is '1 second'). This provides a default interval in case of invalid input.
*   **No suitable interval:** If none of the pre-defined intervals are greater than the `desiredInterval`, the method returns the smallest default interval.
*   **Zero `maxDataPoints`:** If `maxDataPoints` is zero, `desiredInterval` will be infinite, and the code will return the smallest interval due to the loop condition. While mathematically problematic, the code will still run without errors, providing a reasonable default behavior.
*   **`start` and `end` dates are the same:** In this case, `deltaInSeconds` is 0, leading to a `desiredInterval` of 0. This results in the smallest interval being returned.
