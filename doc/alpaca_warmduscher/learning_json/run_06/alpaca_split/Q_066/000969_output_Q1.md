Tracking `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` is important for understanding the *reliability* and *representativeness* of the other data points. It essentially tells us the sample size used to calculate the averages, minimums, and maximums. Here's how it can be used analytically:

*   **Weighted Averages:** Instead of simply averaging `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`, and `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax` across multiple samples, we can calculate weighted averages, giving more weight to samples with a higher `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`. This provides a more accurate overall representation.
*   **Statistical Significance:** A low `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` might indicate that the measured values are not statistically significant or reliable. We can flag or exclude data points with low sample sizes from analysis.
*   **Data Quality Monitoring:** A sudden drop in `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` could indicate a sensor failure or a problem with data collection. Monitoring this metric can help identify data quality issues.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Comparing `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` over time can help identify anomalies. For example, a significant increase could indicate a malfunctioning sensor reporting duplicate data.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** It provides context for the other metrics. A large delta value might be less concerning if the `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` is high, suggesting the measurement is based on a robust sample.
*   **Filtering/Aggregation:** When aggregating data, we can filter out samples with low probe counts or use a minimum probe count threshold to ensure data quality.

In essence, `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` acts as a measure of confidence in the other data, allowing for more informed and reliable analysis. Without it, the other metrics could be misleading.
