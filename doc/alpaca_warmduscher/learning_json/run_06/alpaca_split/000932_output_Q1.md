The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation specifies the order in which the properties of this interface should be serialized when it's converted to JSON. This is particularly useful for REST APIs where consistent JSON output order can be beneficial for clients consuming the API. Without it, the order of properties in the JSON output would depend on the implementation details of the JSON serializer (e.g., alphabetical order), which is not guaranteed and can break client-side code expecting a specific order. Here, it enforces the order: "dayOfWeekStartingMonday", "dayOfWeekText", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", "numOfStatisticRecords1" in the generated JSON. This improves predictability and maintainability for API consumers.
