For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java' with name 'Hooks.java'... 
Consider you're implementing a system where different types of sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity) require different pre and post-processing steps.  How would you use this `Hooks` interface to accommodate this diversity, and what design considerations would you take into account to prevent code duplication?
