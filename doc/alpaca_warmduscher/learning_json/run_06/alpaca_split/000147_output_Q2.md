The primary drawback of this approach is the potential for memory leaks. The `subscribe` call doesn't automatically unsubscribe when the `AppComponent` is destroyed. This means the interval will continue to trigger `myFullPageRefresh` even after the component is no longer in use, leading to unnecessary refreshes and potentially affecting performance. A full page refresh is a jarring user experience.

To address this, we should unsubscribe from the `interval` observable in the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook. Here's how:

```typescript
import {Component, OnDestroy} from '@angular/core';
import {interval} from "rxjs";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
import {HeatingDataService} from "./heating-data.service";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnDestroy {
  title = 'thserver-client';

  constructor() {
    console.log("Setup the page refresh mechanism all " + environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds + " seconds.");
  }

  myFullPageRefresh(): void {
    window.location.reload();
  }

  subscribe;

  ngOnInit() {
    this.subscribe = interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000).subscribe(
      val => {
        console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")
        this.myFullPageRefresh();
      }
    );
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    if (this.subscribe) {
      this.subscribe.unsubscribe();
      console.log("Unsubscribed from full page refresh interval");
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, consider if a full page refresh is truly necessary. Is it possible to update only the data that has changed using Angular's data binding and change detection mechanisms? A more granular approach would be much smoother for the user and significantly more efficient. A WebSocket connection could be established with the server to push updates rather than relying on periodic refreshes.
