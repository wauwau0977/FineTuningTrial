`req.clone()` creates a new, modified copy of the original `HttpRequest` object. This is crucial because `HttpRequest` objects are immutable in Angular.  Directly modifying the original `req` object would violate this immutability principle and could lead to unexpected behavior and errors elsewhere in the application.

Angular's HTTP pipeline relies on the immutability of `HttpRequest` objects. Each interceptor receives the request and is expected to return a new, modified request or pass the original request along unchanged.  By using `clone()`, the interceptor adheres to this contract and ensures that the HTTP pipeline functions correctly.  Without cloning, subsequent interceptors or the HTTP client itself might receive a modified request that they are not expecting, causing errors or unpredictable results.
