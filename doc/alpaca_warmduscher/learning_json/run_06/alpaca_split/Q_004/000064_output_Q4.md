To add 5 pixels of padding to all sides of `mat-card` elements, we would add the following Sass code:

```sass
mat-card
  padding: 5px
```

This line adds a `padding` property to the existing `mat-card` selector, setting it to `5px` which applies the padding equally to the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the element.
