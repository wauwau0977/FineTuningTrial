The `myReload()` method is responsible for fetching the current heating data from the `HeatingDataService` and updating the component's internal state and emitting an event.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Service Utilization:** It calls the `getCurrent(false)` method of the injected `HeatingDataService`. This method presumably makes an asynchronous request to retrieve the latest heating data. The `false` parameter likely controls some behavior on the service side (perhaps indicating to not cache the result).

2.  **Data Processing:** The `subscribe` method is used to handle the asynchronous response from the `heatingDataService.getCurrent()` call.  When the service successfully returns data:
    *   The received data (of type `any`, though likely representing a heating data object) is passed to `HeatingEntity.ofWebService(data)`. This static method presumably transforms the web service response data into an instance of the `HeatingEntity` class, which encapsulates the heating data.  This new `HeatingEntity` instance is then assigned to the component's `heatingEntity` property.

3.  **Event Emission:** After updating the `heatingEntity`, the method emits an event using `this.receivedNewTHValue.emit(data)`. This event, signaled by the `receivedNewTHValue` output event emitter, carries the original `data` received from the service.

4. **Significance of Event Emission**:  The emitted event is crucial for communication between components. It signals to any listening components that the heating data has been updated. This allows other parts of the application to react to the changes and update their displays or logic accordingly. It's a key part of the application's data flow and reactivity. The receiving component(s) would likely subscribe to this event and act on the data accordingly.
