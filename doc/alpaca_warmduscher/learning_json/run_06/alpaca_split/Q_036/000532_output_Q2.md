Using a dedicated component (`overview-current-gauge.component`) for this visualization, rather than embedding the `<highcharts-chart>` directly within a larger parent componentâ€™s template, provides several key benefits rooted in Angular's component-based architecture:

1.  **Encapsulation & Reusability:** The `overview-current-gauge.component` encapsulates all the logic and presentation details related to the gauge chart. This makes the component self-contained, reusable in other parts of the application, and easier to maintain.  You could easily drop this component into different views without duplicating code.

2.  **Improved Testability:**  A dedicated component is far easier to unit test. You can isolate it and test its behavior independently of the larger application.  This simplifies testing and improves code quality.

3.  **Separation of Concerns:**  This approach adheres to the principle of separation of concerns. The parent component focuses on its primary responsibility, while the `overview-current-gauge.component` handles the visualization. This makes the codebase more organized and maintainable.

4.  **Reduced Complexity:**  Embedding the chart directly within a larger template could lead to a complex and hard-to-read template. A dedicated component simplifies the template structure and improves readability.

5.  **Change Detection Optimization:** As mentioned before, using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` is easier to implement and more effective when a component encapsulates a specific visualization because it has fewer dependencies.

6. **Maintainability and Scalability:** As the application grows, using smaller, reusable components makes it easier to maintain and scale the codebase.  Changes to the gauge chart visualization can be made in a single location without affecting other parts of the application.
