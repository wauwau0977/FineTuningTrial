The direct initialization of numerous arrays within the component class, without regard for the expected data volume, can lead to several drawbacks:

*   **Memory Consumption:**  If the application anticipates handling a large dataset (e.g., historical data spanning a significant period), these arrays could consume a substantial amount of memory, potentially leading to performance issues or even crashes, especially on devices with limited resources.
*   **Performance Overhead:**  Allocating a large amount of memory upfront, even if it's not immediately used, can introduce performance overhead during component initialization.  This can slow down the initial rendering of the page.
*   **Maintainability:**  Having a large number of arrays defined at the class level can make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.  It creates visual clutter and makes it difficult to track the purpose of each array.
*   **Potential for Errors:**  If the component logic doesn't correctly manage the size and contents of these arrays, it can lead to out-of-bounds errors or other data-related issues.

Mitigation strategies include:

1.  **Lazy Initialization:**  Instead of initializing the arrays upfront, initialize them only when the data is actually needed. This can be achieved by initializing them within the `myReload()` method, just before the data is fetched and processed.
2.  **Dynamic Array Resizing:** Use techniques that avoid allocating the maximum possible memory at once. For example, you could use a `push()` mechanism to add data to the arrays dynamically as it becomes available, rather than pre-allocating a fixed size.
3.  **Data Streaming/Chunking:** If dealing with very large datasets, consider streaming or chunking the data. This involves processing the data in smaller batches, rather than loading everything into memory at once.  This would likely require modifications to the backend service as well.
4.  **Using Observables/Subjects:**  Instead of storing data in arrays, consider using RxJS Observables or Subjects. These allow you to process data asynchronously and efficiently, without having to store it all in memory at once.  This could also facilitate real-time updates.
5.  **Data Structures:** Consider if arrays are the best data structure for the use-case. Sets, Maps, or other more efficient data structures may be more appropriate depending on the needs of the component.
6.  **Virtualization:** For display purposes, if the data is tabular or list-like, consider using virtualization techniques to render only the visible portion of the data.

Choosing the right mitigation strategy will depend on the specific requirements of the component and the expected data volume.  A combination of these approaches may be necessary to achieve optimal performance and scalability.
