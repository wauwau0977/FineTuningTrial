Adding methods like `getMaxBoilerTemp()`, `getMinBoilerTemp()`, and `getAvgBoilerTemp()` to this interface after it's already in use introduces a breaking change. Consumers of the `BoilerStatsByHour` interface, which could include various reporting components, analytics dashboards, or backend services, would need to be recompiled and redeployed to accommodate the new methods.  Even if the new methods are optional for consumers, the interface definition itself changes, triggering compilation failures where the interface is used.

Further, adding these methods potentially introduces semantic concerns. The current interface focuses on *changes* in boiler difference (increase/decrease) and a record count. Temperature statistics might belong to a different analytical entity.  Mixing these concerns could lead to confusion and harder-to-maintain code.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Create a New Interface:** The best solution is to introduce a new interface (e.g., `BoilerStatsWithTemperature`) that *extends* `BoilerStatsByHour` and includes the temperature-related methods. This allows existing consumers to continue functioning without modification while providing the additional data to new or updated consumers.

2. **Default Methods (Java 8+):** If refactoring to a new interface isnâ€™t feasible, default methods could be added. However, this is generally discouraged in interfaces representing data contracts, as it can create ambiguity and potential runtime errors if default implementations are not carefully considered.  It also doesn't address the semantic concern of mixing analytical concerns.

3. **Versioning:**  If this interface is part of a larger API, consider versioning (e.g., `BoilerStatsByHourV2`). This isolates the changes and forces consumers to explicitly opt-in to the new version, ensuring compatibility.

The preferred solution is the creation of a new interface, preserving the single responsibility of the existing interface and allowing for future flexibility.
