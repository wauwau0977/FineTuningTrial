This class uses constructor-based dependency injection. The `HeatPumpRepository` and `HeatingDataReadService` are injected as final private fields through the constructor. This means that instances of these dependencies are provided to the `HeatPumpDataService` from an external source (likely a Spring container).

Benefits of this approach:

*   **Testability:** Makes unit testing easier as you can mock or stub the dependencies to isolate the `HeatPumpDataService` logic.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Reduces coupling between the class and its dependencies. The class doesn't need to know *how* to create the dependencies, only how to use them.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to change or replace dependencies without modifying the `HeatPumpDataService` class itself.
*   **Immutability:** Final fields enforce immutability of the dependencies once injected, which can contribute to thread safety and predictable behavior.
*   **Clear Dependencies:** The constructor clearly shows all the dependencies required by the class.
