The `@Value` annotation is a Spring Framework annotation used to inject values into fields. In this specific case, it's used to inject the value of the property `thserver.buildTimestampServer` (defined in a properties file or environment variables) into the `buildTimestampServer` field.  Spring's dependency injection mechanism reads the value associated with the key `thserver.buildTimestampServer` from the configuration and automatically assigns it to the `buildTimestampServer` string variable when the `InfoBean` is created and managed by the Spring container. If the property is not found, the field will be initialized with the default value specified (in this case, an empty string "").
