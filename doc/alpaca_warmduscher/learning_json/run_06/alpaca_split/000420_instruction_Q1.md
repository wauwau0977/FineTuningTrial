For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts' with name 'cache.service.spec.ts'... 
The `beforeEach` block configures the testing module and injects the `CacheService`.  What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach compared to other methods of providing dependencies for the service during testing, such as manually instantiating the service or using a dedicated testing module with specific providers?
