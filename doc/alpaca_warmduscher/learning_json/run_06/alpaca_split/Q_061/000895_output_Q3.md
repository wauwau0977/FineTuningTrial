The `default` keyword indicates that this method provides a *default implementation* within the interface itself. Implementing classes are *not* required to override this method if they are satisfied with the default behavior. This is a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows interfaces to contain concrete methods.

In this case, the default implementation generates a short text UUID using the `UUIDUtils` class. This suggests that the ID is automatically generated when a new `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity` instance is created, and the implementing class does not need to explicitly handle ID generation. It's likely used as a primary key for database storage, offering a unique identifier for each set of heat pump statistics. If a specific ID generation strategy is needed, the implementing class *can* override the `getId()` method to provide a custom implementation.
