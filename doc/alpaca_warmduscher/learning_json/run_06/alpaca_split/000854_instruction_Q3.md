For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissRepository.java' with name 'MeteoSwissRepository.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
@Repository
public interface MeteoSwissRepository extends CrudRepository<MeteoSwissEntity,String> {
   
}
```

What is the purpose of the `@Repository` annotation? How does it contribute to the overall functionality and architecture of the application?
