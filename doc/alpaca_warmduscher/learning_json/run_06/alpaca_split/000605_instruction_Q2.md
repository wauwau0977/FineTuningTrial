For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.ts'... 
The following code snippet is part of the component's logic:

```typescript
 subscribe = interval(1000).subscribe(
   val => {
     // do more often intervals, to have better control in app case if it wakes up after a long sleep
     let now = new Date();
     let refreshBackendInterval = 30000;
     if ((now.getTime() - this.lastServiceRefresh.getTime() > refreshBackendInterval)) {
       console.log("Service refresh required. last one was " + this.lastServiceRefresh);
       this.lastServiceRefresh = now;
       this.myReload();
     }
   }
 );
```
