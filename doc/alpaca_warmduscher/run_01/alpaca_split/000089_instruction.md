You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component displays a gauge chart representing current data, likely related to a heating system (given the project name 'Warmduscher'). The chart utilizes the `highcharts-chart` component and visualizes data through a gauge chart defined by `gaugeChartOptions`. The component resides within the 'overview-current' module, suggesting it's part of a dashboard or overview screen. The data displayed is dynamic and supplied through the `highcharts` and `gaugeChartOptions` inputs.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.html
- **Class Name(s):**  While this is an HTML file and doesn't directly represent a class, it’s associated with a component likely named `OverviewCurrentGaugeComponent` (based on filename convention).

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Display a gauge chart visualizing current data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:**  `highcharts` (Highcharts object, potentially configuration data) and `gaugeChartOptions` (Configuration object defining gauge chart properties).
    - **Output:**  Visual representation of a gauge chart within a `mat-card` element.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The component receives `highcharts` and `gaugeChartOptions` as inputs.
    2. The `highcharts-chart` component renders the gauge chart based on the provided configurations.
    3. The chart is displayed within the `mat-card` element.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interaction with the `highcharts-chart` component (a custom or third-party Angular component).
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Handling missing `highcharts` or `gaugeChartOptions` inputs (potentially displaying a default or empty chart, or an error message).
    - Handling invalid data within `gaugeChartOptions` (e.g., incorrect data types) - Chart rendering might fail or display incorrectly.
    - The gauge chart may handle out-of-range values (values exceeding the minimum or maximum allowed), potentially clipping or scaling the value.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Chart rendering should be reasonably fast to avoid UI lag.
- **Scalability**:  This component itself isn't directly scalable, as it only renders data. Scalability relies on the data source and how `highcharts` and `gaugeChartOptions` are populated.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns, as this component only displays data. Data security is the responsibility of the data source.
- **Maintainability**:  The component is simple and relatively easy to maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The component's reliability depends on the `highcharts-chart` component and the underlying data source.
- **Usability**:  The chart should be clearly visible and easy to understand.  The size (100px x 50px) may need adjustment based on screen size and other UI elements.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are apparent.

## 5. Key Components

- **`highcharts-chart`**: Custom or third-party Angular component responsible for rendering Highcharts charts.
- **`mat-card`**: Material Design component providing a container for the chart.
- **`gaugeChartOptions`**: Configuration object defining the gauge chart properties (e.g., minimum value, maximum value, color ranges, value displayed).
- **Data Flow**: Data is passed from the parent component via the `gaugeChartOptions` input to the `highcharts-chart` component, which then renders the chart.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- HTML templates
- Angular component lifecycle

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular:** Core framework for building the application.
- **Material Design (Angular Material):** Provides UI components like `mat-card`.
- **Highcharts:** JavaScript charting library (likely included as an Angular module).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
-  This component likely depends on a service or component that provides the `gaugeChartOptions` data.  The exact dependency isn’t apparent from the HTML file alone.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Responsiveness**: Consider making the chart responsive to different screen sizes (e.g., using percentage-based widths and heights).
- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure that the `gaugeChartOptions` data is valid before rendering the chart. This could prevent unexpected errors or incorrect visualizations.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where the `highcharts-chart` component fails to render the chart.
- **Customization**:  Allow for more customization of the chart's appearance through input properties.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the chart is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., providing alternative text for screen readers).
