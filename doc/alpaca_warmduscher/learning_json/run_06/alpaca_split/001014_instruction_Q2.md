For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java'... 
The entity class has many `Date` fields for min and max dates. What potential issues might arise from storing both individual measurements (`temperature`, `windGustSpeed`) *and* their min/max dates? Describe a potential use case where storing both would be beneficial, and a situation where it might be redundant or problematic.
