`CrudRepository` provides a standard set of methods for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database entity without requiring you to write boilerplate SQL or JPA code. Benefits include rapid development, reduced code complexity, and leveraging Spring Data's built-in features like transaction management and exception handling. It handles common database interactions with minimal effort.

However, there are scenarios where a custom repository is preferable. For example, if you need complex queries that aren't easily expressed with Spring Data's derived query methods or need to perform very specific database optimizations, a custom repository implementing a `JpaRepository` or using native queries would be better. Another scenario could be if your application requires custom validation logic that cannot be implemented using JPA entity lifecycle callbacks. Finally, when dealing with specific database features or vendor-specific optimizations, a custom repository provides the necessary flexibility to achieve the desired performance or functionality. Using derived methods can be inefficient or impossible, necessitating raw SQL or a more tailored approach.
