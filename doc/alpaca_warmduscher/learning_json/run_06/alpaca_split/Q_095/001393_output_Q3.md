This code snippet demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI), a core principle of the Inversion of Control (IoC) design pattern. Specifically, it's Constructor Injection. The `EmailService` class doesn't create its own `MailSend` instance; instead, it receives an instance of `MailSend` through its constructor. 

The primary benefit in this context is increased testability and loose coupling.  By decoupling `EmailService` from the concrete implementation of `MailSend`, we can easily:

1.  **Mock `MailSend` for testing:**  We can inject a mock `MailSend` object during unit testing to isolate `EmailService` and verify its behavior without actually sending emails.
2.  **Switch implementations easily:** If we want to use a different email sending library or service, we can simply provide a different implementation of `MailSend` without modifying the `EmailService` code.
3. **Improve maintainability:** Loose coupling makes the code easier to maintain and refactor.
