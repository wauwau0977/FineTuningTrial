For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass' with name 'overview-current.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```sass
.boilerTemp
 margin-left: 10px
```
What is the purpose of the `.boilerTemp` class, and how does it affect the layout of elements to which it is applied? Consider the use of only `margin-left`.
