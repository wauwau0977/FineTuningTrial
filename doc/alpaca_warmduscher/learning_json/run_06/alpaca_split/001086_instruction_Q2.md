For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavor.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavor.java'... 
Consider the `encodeUnicodeStringToBase58String` and `decodeBase58ToUnicodeString` methods. Explain the purpose of these methods and why they are implemented using UTF-8 encoding. What potential issues could arise if a different character encoding (e.g., ASCII) were used instead?
