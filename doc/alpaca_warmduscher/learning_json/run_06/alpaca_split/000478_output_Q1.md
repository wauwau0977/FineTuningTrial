Having a large number of properties like this presents both benefits and drawbacks. The primary benefit is that all related data is encapsulated in a single object, which can simplify data passing and processing in certain scenarios. However, it also introduces significant drawbacks.  The class becomes harder to understand, maintain, and test.  Changes to one property might have unintended consequences elsewhere, and the class becomes a prime candidate for the Single Responsibility Principle violation.

Refactoring options include:

*   **Grouping Properties into Sub-Entities:**  Instead of a single `HeatingEntity`, consider creating separate entities like `TemperatureData`, `PumpStatus`, `ErrorCodes`, etc., each containing related properties. The `HeatingEntity` would then hold instances of these sub-entities. This promotes cohesion and separation of concerns.
*   **Using Data Structures (Maps/Records):**  If some properties are only used in specific scenarios, consider using a `Map` or a `Record` to hold those properties. This allows you to dynamically add or remove properties without affecting the core `HeatingEntity`.
*   **Applying the Facade Pattern:**  A facade could be created to simplify access to the properties, hiding the complexity of the large number of fields.
*   **Consider Value Objects:** Some of these properties might be better represented as value objects (e.g., a `Temperature` class with `value` and `unit` properties).

The best approach depends on how the data is actually used in the application, but the goal is to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
