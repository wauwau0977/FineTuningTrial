You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component displays current heating data for a heating entity, including boiler temperature, outdoor temperature (from both the heating system and MeteoSwiss), and a boiler chart. It's designed to present a real-time overview of the heating system’s performance. The component uses Angular Material for layout and styling.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.html
- **Class Name(s):**  Although this is an HTML file, it’s closely associated with the `OverviewCurrentComponent` class (TypeScript) which would define the logic and data bindings.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Display real-time heating data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Inputs:** The component receives data through the `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity` objects.
    - **Outputs:**  The component displays the data in a formatted manner within the MatCard and BoilerChart.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The component receives `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity` data.
    2. It extracts relevant data like `boilerTemp`, `ireg300TempOutdoor`, `measurementDate`, and `temperature`.
    3. It formats the data using Angular’s `date` and `number` pipes.
    4.  It displays the formatted data within the MatCard and passes `overviewMode="true"` to the `app-boiler-chart` component.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interaction with `app-boiler-chart` component via input binding (`[overviewMode]="true"`).
    - Data is bound from the associated TypeScript component to display the data.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If `heatingEntity.id` is null, the displayed time will show "...". This handles cases where heating entity data is not yet available.
    - No explicit error handling is present within this HTML, error handling would be in the underlying TypeScript component.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The component should render quickly to display real-time data without noticeable delays.
- **Scalability**: The component itself is stateless and should scale well as the application grows. Scalability will primarily depend on the underlying data source and the performance of the `app-boiler-chart` component.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within this HTML; security measures would be implemented in the backend and TypeScript component.
- **Maintainability**: The component uses Angular Material, which is well-documented and provides a consistent look and feel. Using Flexbox layout aids in maintaining responsiveness.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Component's reliability depends on the stability of the data sources and the Angular framework.
- **Usability**:  The layout is designed to be clear and easy to understand, providing a concise overview of heating data.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are evident in this HTML.

## 5. Key Components

- **`heatingEntity`**:  Object containing data about the heating system, including boiler temperature, outdoor temperature, and measurement date.
- **`meteoSwissEntity`**: Object containing data from MeteoSwiss, including outdoor temperature.
- **Angular Material Components**:
    - `mat-card`:  Provides a container for the heating data.
    - `mat-card-header`, `mat-card-content`, `mat-card-footer`: Structure the card content.
    - `mat-card-title`: Displays the title and time.
- **`app-boiler-chart`**:  A custom component responsible for displaying a chart of boiler data.  `overviewMode` input is set to `true`.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Uses `fxLayout`, `fxFlex`, and `fxLayout.xs/gt-xs` for responsive layout.
- **Data Formatting**: Uses Angular’s `date` and `number` pipes to format the displayed data.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **HTML**:  The foundation of the component.
- **TypeScript**: Used for the associated component logic and data bindings.
- **Angular**: Framework for building the application.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular Material**: UI component library for consistent styling and layout.
- **Angular Flex-Layout**:  Provides a flexible and responsive layout system.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- No explicit internal project dependencies are evident in the HTML itself. Dependencies would be in the associated TypeScript component.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: If the `app-boiler-chart` component is complex, consider optimizing its rendering performance.
- **Code Readability**: The HTML is relatively clear, but consider adding more comments if the logic becomes more complex.
- **Error Handling**: Add explicit error handling in the TypeScript component to handle cases where `heatingEntity` or `meteoSwissEntity` data is unavailable or invalid. Display appropriate messages to the user.
- **Scalability Considerations**: If the application needs to handle a large number of heating entities, consider optimizing the data loading and rendering process.  Caching data could be beneficial.
