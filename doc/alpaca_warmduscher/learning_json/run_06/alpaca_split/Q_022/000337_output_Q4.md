The `AboutComponent`’s constructor is responsible for initializing the component's dependencies. In this case, it injects an instance of `HeatingDataService`.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object receives other objects that it depends on. Instead of the object creating its dependencies itself, they are *provided* to it from an external source – often a DI framework (like Angular’s). This promotes loose coupling, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

In this instance, Angular’s DI system is being utilized. The `constructor(private heatingDataService: HeatingDataService)` syntax tells Angular to provide an instance of the `HeatingDataService` when creating an instance of the `AboutComponent`. The `private` keyword not only declares a private member variable `heatingDataService` but also instructs Angular to inject an instance of the service.

The type of the injected dependency is `HeatingDataService`. This service is responsible for providing access to server-side information, specifically the server build timestamp, as used by the `getBuildTimestampServer` method. It encapsulates the logic for fetching this information, potentially from an API endpoint. The `HeatingDataService` is the bridge between the Angular component and the server-side build information.
