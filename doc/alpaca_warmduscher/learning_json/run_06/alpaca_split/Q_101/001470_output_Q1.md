The `@font-face` rules are used to define custom fonts (Roboto and Material Icons) for use within the application. They tell the browser where to download the font files from and how to apply them. Without these rules, the browser wouldn't know how to render the text using these specific fonts.

The separate style block defining `.mat-typography` and `.mat-app-background` defines high-level CSS rules that set the base typography and background color for the entire application, likely as part of a component library (Angular Material in this case).

The interaction is as follows:

1.  **`@font-face` sets up the fonts:** These rules make the Roboto and Material Icons fonts available for use within the application's CSS.
2.  **`.mat-typography` applies the font:** The `.mat-typography` class likely applies the Roboto font to various text elements throughout the application, defining its font family, weight, size, and line height. This class is probably applied to a root element or a common container, ensuring that the typography is consistent across the application.
3.  **`.mat-app-background` sets the overall theme:** The `.mat-app-background` class sets the background color for the entire application, establishing a consistent visual theme.

In essence, the `@font-face` rules provide the fonts, and the `.mat-typography` and `.mat-app-background` classes leverage those fonts and define other base styling rules to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and update the application's styling.
