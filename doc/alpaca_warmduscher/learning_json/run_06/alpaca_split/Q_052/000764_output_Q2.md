The `@Param("group_every_nth_second")` annotation is a Spring Data JPA annotation that binds the method parameter `groupEveryNthSecon` to a named parameter in the native SQL query. This allows the value of the Java variable to be dynamically inserted into the SQL query string during execution.

In this case, the `groupEveryNthSecon` parameter controls the granularity of the time interval used for aggregation. The native query uses this parameter within the following line:

`round(extract(epoch from measurement_date) / :group_every_nth_second) groupid`

Here's how it works:

1.  **`extract(epoch from measurement_date)`:**  This extracts the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) from the `measurement_date` column. This results in a numeric representation of the timestamp.
2.  **`/ :group_every_nth_second`:** The extracted epoch time is then divided by the value of `groupEveryNthSecon`.  This effectively groups the data into intervals of `groupEveryNthSecon` seconds.
3.  **`round(...)`:**  The result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer. This creates a unique group ID for each time interval.
4.  **`groupid`:**  The rounded value is assigned to the alias `groupid`.

The subsequent `GROUP BY groupid` clause groups the rows in the `heat_pump` table based on these generated `groupid` values. This means that all measurements within the same `groupEveryNthSecon`-second interval will be aggregated together, and the query will return one row of statistics for each such interval.

Therefore, a larger value for `groupEveryNthSecon` will result in wider time intervals and fewer aggregated rows in the result set, while a smaller value will result in finer-grained intervals and more rows. The method effectively allows the caller to dynamically control the temporal resolution of the aggregated heat pump statistics.
