The combination of `getMeasurementDate()`, `getMeasurementDateMin()`, and `getMeasurementDateMax()` suggests a few possibilities regarding the data model and querying capabilities:

1.  **Time Series Data:** This strongly hints that the statistics are being stored as a time series. `getMeasurementDate()` likely represents the specific timestamp of a single data point. `getMeasurementDateMin()` and `getMeasurementDateMax()` probably represent the start and end timestamps for the data covered by the other statistics (e.g., boiler temperature, compressor hours) in this entity.

2.  **Data Aggregation:** The min/max dates are likely used to define the *time window* over which the other statistics have been aggregated. For instance, all the other values in the entity relate to data collected between `getMeasurementDateMin()` and `getMeasurementDateMax()`.

3.  **Querying Flexibility:** This setup allows for flexible querying. You can query for:
    *   Statistics for a specific `MeasurementDate`.
    *   Statistics within a specific date range using `MeasurementDateMin` and `MeasurementDateMax`.
    *   Statistics for a particular period (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly) by setting appropriate `MeasurementDateMin` and `MeasurementDateMax` values.

4. **Data Partitioning:** This setup could be used in conjunction with data partitioning schemes, for example, partitioning data by month or day, to improve query performance and scalability.

In essence, this combination of methods allows for capturing a snapshot of the heat pump's performance over a specific period, enabling historical analysis, trend identification, and performance monitoring.
