Based on the test code, we can infer the following about the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method:

*   **Input Parameters:** It likely accepts two double values as input. These values correspond to temperature and relative humidity. The order appears to be temperature first, then relative humidity.
*   **Return Type:** It returns a double value, which represents the calculated absolute humidity.
*   **Units:** Given the range of the asserted values (13.7-13.9, 15.5-15.6, 3.3-3.5), it's highly probable that the absolute humidity is expressed in grams of water per cubic meter (g/m³). The temperature is likely in degrees Celsius (°C), and the relative humidity is likely a percentage (%).
