The getter and setter methods are implementing the **Encapsulation** principle, which is a core tenet of Object-Oriented Programming, and are often associated with the **Bean** or **Data Transfer Object (DTO)** pattern.

Here's how it manifests and the benefits:

*   **Data Hiding:** The instance variables (e.g., `sessionId`, `sessionCreateDate`) are declared as `private`, preventing direct access from outside the class.
*   **Controlled Access:** Access to the data is provided through public getter and setter methods. This allows the class to control how the data is read and modified.

Benefits in this context:

*   **Data Integrity:** The class can add validation logic within the setter methods to ensure that only valid data is assigned to the attributes.  For example, you could check if a `sessionId` is in a specific format.
*   **Flexibility:** The internal implementation of the class can be changed without affecting external code that uses the class, as long as the getter/setter interfaces remain consistent.
*   **Maintainability:** Encapsulation makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. Changes to the internal data representation are isolated within the class.
*   **ORM Compatibility:**  This pattern is crucial for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate or JPA. These frameworks rely on getter and setter methods to map object attributes to database columns.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Encapsulation promotes loose coupling between classes, as external code interacts with the object through well-defined interfaces rather than directly accessing its internal data.
