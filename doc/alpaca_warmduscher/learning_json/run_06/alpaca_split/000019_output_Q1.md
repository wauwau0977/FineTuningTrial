`enableProdMode()` is a function provided by Angular that, when called, significantly optimizes the application for production deployment. It disables various development-time checks and features that are beneficial during development but add overhead in production. This includes removing debugging code, stripping unnecessary metadata, and enabling more aggressive compilation optimizations.

The impact on performance is substantial â€“ typically resulting in a smaller bundle size and faster initial load times, as well as improved runtime performance. However, once `enableProdMode()` is called, debugging becomes more difficult. Stack traces are less informative, and certain error messages may be more generic. It's crucial to call this *before* bootstrapping the application to ensure these optimizations are applied from the very beginning. The `environment.production` flag ensures this only happens in production builds.
