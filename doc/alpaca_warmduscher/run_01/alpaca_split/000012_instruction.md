You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This configuration class, `DateTimeConfig`, is designed to customize date and time formatting within the 'Warmduscher' application, specifically for JSON serialization/deserialization and Spring's data binding. It ensures consistent formatting of `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects using ISO date and time formats. This aims to streamline data exchange and improve data handling throughout the application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/DateTimeConfig.java
- **Class Name(s):** `DateTimeConfig`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Customizes date and time formatting for JSON serialization, deserialization and Spring's data binding.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:** This class doesn't directly handle user input/output. Its configuration affects how date and time data is processed within the application.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `@Configuration` annotation signals Spring to treat this class as a source of bean definitions.
    2. The `conversionService()` bean defines a `FormattingConversionService` that registers custom formatters for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`.
    3. The `localDateFormatter()` and `localDateTimeFormatter()` beans create custom `Formatter` implementations for parsing and printing `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects.
    4. These custom formatters use `DateTimeFormatter` instances configured with ISO date and time formats.
- **External Interactions:** Interacts with Spring's data binding and JSON serialization mechanisms.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** The `parse()` methods of the custom `Formatter` implementations will throw `ParseException` if the input string does not conform to the expected ISO date/time format.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The configuration should not introduce significant overhead during data binding or JSON serialization/deserialization. The use of standard Java `DateTimeFormatter` instances is generally efficient.
- **Scalability:**  The configuration is stateless and should scale well with increased application load.
- **Security:** No direct security implications.
- **Maintainability:** The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain. Changes to the date/time formats can be made by modifying the `DateTimeFormatter` instances.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The configuration itself is reliable. The application's overall reliability depends on the correctness of the date/time data it processes.
- **Usability:** Simplifies date/time handling by providing consistent formatting.
- **Compliance:** Complies with ISO 8601 date and time standards through the use of `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE` and `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME`.

## 5. Key Components

- **`conversionService()` Function:** Configures and returns a `FormattingConversionService` bean.
- **`localDateFormatter()` Function:** Creates a custom `Formatter` for `LocalDate` parsing and printing.
- **`localDateTimeFormatter()` Function:** Creates a custom `Formatter` for `LocalDateTime` parsing and printing.
- **`dateFormat` & `dateTimeFormat`:** Static `DateTimeFormatter` instances used for formatting dates and date/times.
- **Error handling:** Uses standard Java exceptions (`ParseException`) for error handling during parsing.
- **Classes:** Only one class defined: `DateTimeConfig`. No subclasses.
- **Modules:** This class acts as a configuration module, providing custom formatting rules for date and time data within the application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures:** None explicitly used beyond basic Java objects.
- **File handling:** Not used.
- **Concurrency/threading:** Not used.
- **Java Time API (java.time):** Utilized extensively for date and time formatting and parsing.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework:**  Dependencies on Spring annotations (`@Configuration`, `@Bean`) and related classes (`FormattingConversionService`, `Formatter`).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- No internal project dependencies are explicitly visible from the provided code snippet. It assumes standard Spring Boot project structure.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** Consider caching `DateTimeFormatter` instances if performance is critical, though it's unlikely to be a bottleneck in most cases.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already quite readable.  Comments could be added explaining the purpose of each bean.
- **Security Improvements:** No specific security vulnerabilities are apparent.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The configuration is already stateless and should scale well. No specific changes are needed.
- **Configuration Externalization:**  Consider externalizing the date/time formats to an application configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) for greater flexibility and configurability.
