For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java' with name 'GlobalSynced.java'... 
Consider the following code snippet within the `requestOperation` method:

```java
try {
    reentrantLock.lock();
    if (hooks != null) {
        hooks.before(syncedObject);
    }
    m.operateGlobalSynced(syncedObject);
} catch (Throwable t1) {
    // ... error handling ...
}
```

What could happen if the `hooks.before(syncedObject)` method *itself* throws an exception? How would that affect the overall behavior of the `requestOperation` method, and what, if anything, could you do to mitigate the risk?
