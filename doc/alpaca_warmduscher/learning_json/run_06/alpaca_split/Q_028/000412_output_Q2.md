In Highcharts, `arearange` creates an area chart that displays a range for each data point, rather than a single value. This means that for each x-axis value (e.g., a timestamp), there are *two* y-values that define the upper and lower bounds of the shaded area.  

A standard `'area'` chart, in contrast, displays a single y-value for each x-axis value, filling the area between the line and the x-axis.

For an `arearange` chart to render correctly, the `data` array *must* be an array of arrays (or an array of tuples). Each inner array represents a single data point and must contain exactly two numbers:

`[[x1, yMin1, yMax1], [x2, yMin2, yMax2], ...]`

*   `x` is the x-axis value (e.g., a timestamp).
*   `yMin` is the lower bound of the range for that x-value.
*   `yMax` is the upper bound of the range for that x-value.

In the provided code, `this.heatingInTempMinMax` and `this.heatingTempDelta` are expected to follow this structure, providing both a minimum and maximum temperature value for each point in time.  If the data isnâ€™t formatted this way, the chart will likely fail to render correctly or produce unexpected results.
