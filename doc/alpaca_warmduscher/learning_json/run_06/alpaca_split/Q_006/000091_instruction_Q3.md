For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app-routing.module.ts' with name 'app-routing.module.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [];
```

What is the purpose of defining `routes` as an empty array in this Angular application's routing module? What implications does this have on the application's navigation?
