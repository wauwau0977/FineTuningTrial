`ThException` should be reserved for exceptional conditions that indicate a problem with the application’s logic or state, not for expected or recoverable errors. For example, if a sensor reading comes back with a value that is physically impossible (e.g., temperature of -274°C), throwing `ThException` would be appropriate. This signals that something fundamentally wrong is happening with the sensor data or the data processing pipeline. Conversely, a simple network timeout or missing sensor data should be handled gracefully with retries or default values, *not* by throwing `ThException`. We want to avoid silencing legitimate recoverable issues by overly using unchecked exceptions.
