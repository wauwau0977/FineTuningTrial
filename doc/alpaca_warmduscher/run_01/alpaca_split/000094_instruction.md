You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a data class, `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`, representing boiler statistics aggregated by hour. It encapsulates data related to increases and decreases in boiler differences, as well as the number of statistic records contributing to the aggregation. The class provides methods for creating instances, including an empty instance and an instance from web service data.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code primarily serves to define a data structure for representing hourly boiler statistics and provides factory methods for creating instances of this structure.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This class doesn't directly interact with users. Its inputs are data used to construct instances (either hardcoded values, or data received from a web service). The output is an instance of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The constructor initializes an instance with the provided `hourOfTheDay`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, and `numOfStatisticRecords1` values.
    2. `emptyInstance()` returns a default instance with all numeric values initialized to 0.
    3. `ofWebService(data)` attempts to construct an instance from web service data. If the input `data` is null, it returns an `emptyInstance()`. Otherwise, it extracts data from the input `data` object and uses it to create a new `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`.
- **External Interactions**: The `ofWebService` method assumes the receipt of data from an external web service.  It doesn't specify the exact protocol or format of that data, only that it expects an object with properties named `hourOfTheDay`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, and `numOfStatisticRecords1`.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - The `ofWebService` method handles null input data by returning an empty instance.  This prevents errors when processing potentially missing or invalid data from the web service.  However, it doesn't handle the case where the incoming data object is missing one or more of the expected properties. This could lead to undefined behavior.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The class operations are simple data encapsulation and construction. Performance is not a significant concern.
- **Scalability**: The class is a data structure and doesnâ€™t inherently affect scalability. Scalability concerns would be relevant to the overall application handling numerous instances of this class.
- **Security**: The class does not directly handle sensitive data and therefore has minimal security concerns.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. The use of a constructor and static factory methods promotes code organization.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class is reliable as long as the data it receives is valid. The handling of null data in `ofWebService` improves robustness.
- **Usability**:  The class is easy to use as it simply defines a data structure and provides methods for creating instances.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are apparent.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `constructor(hourOfTheDay, sumBoilerDiffIncrease, sumBoilerDiffDecrease, numOfStatisticRecords1)`: Initializes a new instance with provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()`: Returns an empty instance of the class.
    - `ofWebService(data)`: Creates an instance from web service data, handling null input.
- **Important logic flows**: The primary logic flows are related to instance creation, particularly the handling of null data from the web service.
- **Error handling**:  The code handles null input in `ofWebService` by returning an empty instance.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: This is a standalone class.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** N/A, performance is not a concern.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements:** N/A.
- **Scalability Considerations:** N/A.
- **Input Validation:** Add input validation in `ofWebService` to ensure that the incoming data object contains all the expected properties.  This would prevent runtime errors if the web service returns unexpected data.  Consider throwing an error if essential properties are missing.
- **Type Safety:**  Consider using a dedicated type or interface to define the expected structure of the `data` object in `ofWebService`. This would improve type safety and make the code more robust.
