You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface defines a Spring Data JPA repository for querying and retrieving aggregated meteorological statistics from the `meteo_swiss` table. It provides methods to fetch statistics within a given date range, optionally grouping the data by fixed intervals or using a row limit. The primary purpose is to provide data for historical analysis and visualization of weather patterns.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatsRepository.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissStatsRepository`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Retrieve aggregated meteorological data (temperature, wind gust) within a specified date range.
    - Aggregate data based on a fixed time interval.
    - Limit the number of returned rows.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**
        - `measurement_date_start`: Start date for the query.
        - `measurement_date_end`: End date for the query.
        - `maxRows`: Maximum number of rows to return.
        - `groupEveryNthSecond`: Interval (in seconds) for grouping the data.
    - **Outputs:**
        - `List<MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity>`: A list of `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` objects, each representing aggregated statistics for a given station and time interval/group.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The repository methods execute native SQL queries against the `meteo_swiss` table.
    2. The queries aggregate data using functions like `max`, `min`, `avg`.
    3. Optional grouping is performed based on the `groupEveryNthSecond` parameter.
    4. The results are mapped to `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` objects.
    5. The `findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats` limits the number of rows.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Database interaction: Executes native SQL queries against the `meteo_swiss` table.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - If `measurement_date_start` is after `measurement_date_end`, the query should return an empty list or handle this case appropriately. (Not explicitly defined in the code, needs clarification)
    - If the database connection fails, the repository should handle the exception and potentially log an error. (Handled by Spring Data JPA, not explicitly in this interface)
    - Invalid input values (e.g., non-date values) will be handled by the underlying database or Spring Data JPA.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Queries should execute reasonably fast, considering the size of the `meteo_swiss` table. Indexing the `temperature_measure_date` column is crucial for performance.
- **Scalability:** The repository should be able to handle a large volume of data without significant performance degradation. Consider database partitioning or caching if needed.
- **Security:**  Access to the underlying database should be properly secured.
- **Maintainability:** The use of native SQL queries may reduce maintainability. Consider using a more object-relational mapping (ORM) approach in the future.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The repository should be reliable and available as part of the overall application.
- **Usability:** Easy to integrate into other parts of the application.

## 5. Key Components

- **`findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats()`:** Retrieves aggregated statistics between the specified dates, limiting the number of rows returned. It groups by `ntile` and `station_id`.
- **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats()`:** Retrieves aggregated statistics between the specified dates, grouping the data by a fixed time interval (specified in seconds).
- **Native SQL Queries:** Both methods use native SQL queries for data aggregation and filtering.
- **`MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`:** A JPA entity used to represent the aggregated statistical data.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is delegated to Spring Data JPA and the underlying database connection.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Java 8 or later (based on the project)
- Data structures (Lists)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Data JPA:** Provides the `CrudRepository` interface and handles database interactions.
- **Spring Framework:** Core framework for dependency injection and overall application management.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** API for interacting with relational databases.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`:** Entity class used to store the aggregated statistics.



## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Analyze query execution plans to identify potential bottlenecks.
    - Ensure appropriate indexes are in place on the `temperature_measure_date` and `station_id` columns.
    - Consider caching frequently accessed data.
- **Code Readability:**
    -  While the interface is concise, the native SQL queries are lengthy and could benefit from being formatted for better readability.
    -  Consider using a query builder or a more object-relational mapping (ORM) approach to improve maintainability and reduce the complexity of the SQL queries.
- **Security Improvements:**
    -  Ensure that the database connection is properly secured and protected against unauthorized access.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    -  If the `meteo_swiss` table grows significantly, consider partitioning the table or using a distributed database solution.
    -  Implement caching to reduce the load on the database.
- **Error Handling:** Add explicit error handling within the repository to log errors or throw custom exceptions.
