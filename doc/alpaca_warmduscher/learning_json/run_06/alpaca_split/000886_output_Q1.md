The decision to use both `Double` and `Integer` as return types likely stems from the nature of the data being represented.

*   **Precision Requirements:** Parameters like temperatures (`BoilerTemp`, `HeatingIn`, `SoleOut`, etc.) often require decimal precision, hence the use of `Double`.  These values are likely sensor readings where fractional values are meaningful.
*   **Discrete Values:**  Parameters like `CompressorHours` represent counts of something discrete. It doesnâ€™t make sense to have a fraction of a compressor hour, so `Integer` is appropriate.

The implications for clients are:

*   **Type Handling:** Clients will need to handle two different return types.  This could involve type checking, casting, or using generic code to accommodate both.
*   **Potential for Errors:**  If a client expects a consistent type and receives the wrong one, it could lead to runtime errors.
*   **Code Complexity:** Handling multiple types can add complexity to client code.
*   **Nullability Considerations:** While not explicitly stated, `Double` and `Integer` can be null in some situations. Clients need to handle potential null values.

A potential improvement would be to consider using a common type (like `Number`) or a dedicated class to represent these values, which could offer more flexibility and type safety.
