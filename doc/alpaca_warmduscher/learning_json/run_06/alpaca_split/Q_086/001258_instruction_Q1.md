For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java' with name 'MyStartUpListener.java'... What potential issues could arise if the `StartupData` bean is not defined in the application context? How could this be handled more gracefully?
