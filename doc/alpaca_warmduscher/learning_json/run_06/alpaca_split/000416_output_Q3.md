The `outside: true` property within the `tooltip` configuration instructs Highcharts to position the tooltip outside of the chart's plotting area, even if it means going beyond the chart's boundaries.

The primary problem it solves is tooltip overlap and readability. When data points are close together, or when labels on the chart are numerous, tooltips can overlap with chart elements like data points, labels, or even the chart border, making them difficult to read or understand. By positioning the tooltip outside, it ensures the entire tooltip content is visible, unobstructed, and easily readable, even in dense chart areas. It improves the user experience by making the data presented in the tooltip readily accessible. This is especially useful for charts with many data points or complex labels where space is limited within the plotting area.
