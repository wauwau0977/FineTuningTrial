For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts' with name 'environment.prod.ts'... 
Considering this configuration file is used in a production environment, what potential security implications could arise from exposing `buildTimestampClient` directly within the JavaScript bundle served to the client? How might you mitigate this risk without significantly impacting development workflows?
