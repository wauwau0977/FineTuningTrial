For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/Profiles.java' with name 'Profiles.java'... 
Imagine you are refactoring the application to utilize dependency injection. How could you effectively integrate these profile strings (like `SENSOR_MOCK`) with a dependency injection framework (e.g., Spring) to dynamically switch between different implementations of a service based on the current profile?
