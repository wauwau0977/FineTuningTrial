```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    SessionRequest that = (SessionRequest) o;
    return id != null ? id.equals(that.id) : that.id == null;
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return id != null ? id.hashCode() : 0;
}
```

The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are crucial for ensuring proper object comparison and behavior when using `SessionRequest` objects in collections like `HashSet` or as keys in `HashMap`.

**Purpose:**

*   **`equals(Object o)`:**  Determines if two `SessionRequest` objects are logically equivalent.  It compares the *content* of the objects, not just their memory addresses.

*   **`hashCode()`:**  Returns an integer value that uniquely represents the object. This value is used by hash-based collections (like `HashMap` and `HashSet`) to quickly locate objects.

**Relationship:**

The contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()` is vital:

1.  If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, then their `hashCode()` values *must* be the same.
2.  If two objects have the same `hashCode()`, they are *not necessarily* equal (hash collisions can occur). However, the `equals()` method *must* still be called to confirm equality.

**Logic:**

In the `SessionRequest` class, equality is determined solely based on the `id` field.

*   **`equals()`:**
    *   It first checks if the objects are the same instance (`this == o`).
    *   Then, it checks if `o` is null or if it's not an instance of `SessionRequest`. If either is true, they can't be equal.
    *   Finally, it compares the `id` fields of the two objects using the `equals()` method of the `String` class. If the `id`s are equal (or both are null), the objects are considered equal.

*   **`hashCode()`:**
    *   It returns the `hashCode()` of the `id` field. If `id` is null, it returns 0. This ensures that objects with the same `id` will have the same hash code, and that null `id`s are handled gracefully.

**Why Both are Necessary:**

*   **Collections Behavior:** When using `SessionRequest` objects as keys in a `HashMap` or storing them in a `HashSet`, the collection relies on the `hashCode()` to determine where to store the object. If two objects are equal but have different hash codes, the collection won't recognize them as the same object, leading to incorrect behavior.

*   **Consistency:** If you override `equals()`, you *must* also override `hashCode()` to maintain the contract. Otherwise, the collection's behavior will be inconsistent and unpredictable.
