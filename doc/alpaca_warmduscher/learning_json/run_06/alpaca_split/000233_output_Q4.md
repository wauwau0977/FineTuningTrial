```typescript
getServerInfo() {
  // Purpose: This method retrieves general information about the server.  This could include version numbers, uptime, configuration settings, or other metadata.

  // HTTP Request Construction:
  // - The method performs an HTTP GET request to the server using 'this.http.get()'.
  // - The URL is constructed as 'this.serviceBaseURL + '/info/general''.
  // - No query parameters or request body are included.

  // Return Value:
  // - The 'http.get()' method returns an Observable. The expected return type depends on the server-side implementation, but it's likely to be a JSON object.  The Observable emits this JSON object when the response is received.

  // Potential Response Information:
  // The response could contain any information the server administrator deems relevant. Common examples include:
  // - Server version number.
  // - Server uptime (e.g., how long the server has been running).
  // - Database connection details (potentially masked for security).
  // - Configuration settings (e.g., logging level, caching configuration).
  // - System hardware information (e.g., CPU, memory).
  // - List of available API endpoints.
  // - Build timestamps.
  // - Feature flags indicating which functionalities are enabled.

  return this.http.get(this.serviceBaseURL + '/info/general');
