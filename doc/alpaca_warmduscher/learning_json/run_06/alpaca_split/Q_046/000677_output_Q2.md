Using constructor injection for the dependencies `HeatingDataReadService`, `AuditLogRepository`, `InfoBean`, and `StartupData` in `ThserverApplication` provides several key benefits:

*   **Immutability:** Dependencies are assigned once at object creation, making the class's dependencies immutable. This promotes thread safety and reduces the risk of unexpected state changes.
*   **Clear Dependencies:** The constructor explicitly lists all required dependencies, making it immediately clear what the class relies on. This enhances readability and maintainability.
*   **Testability:** Constructor injection simplifies unit testing by allowing easy mocking of dependencies. You can pass in mock objects during testing to isolate the class being tested.
*   **Required Dependencies:** The Spring framework enforces that all constructor dependencies are satisfied. This prevents runtime errors caused by missing dependencies.
*   **Early Validation:**  Dependency resolution happens during application startup, which allows for early detection of configuration errors.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

*   **Difficulty with Optional Dependencies:** If a dependency is optional, constructor injection can be awkward.  You would need to introduce default values or conditional logic.
*   **Tight Coupling:**  While constructor injection promotes clear dependencies, it can also create tight coupling between classes. Changes to one dependency might require changes to the class using it.
*   **Large Constructor:** If a class has many dependencies, the constructor can become large and unwieldy.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Interface-Based Programming:** Inject interfaces instead of concrete implementations. This reduces coupling and allows for easier swapping of dependencies during testing or runtime.
*   **Dependency Injection Framework:** Utilize a dependency injection framework (like Spring, which is already being used) to manage dependencies effectively.
*   **Consider Alternatives for Optional Dependencies:** Use `@Autowired(required = false)` with field injection, or provide default implementations for optional dependencies.
*    **Record or Configuration Classes:** For classes with many dependencies, consider using records or configuration classes to group related dependencies and simplify the constructor.
