Using `localStorage` ensures that the client ID is persisted across browser sessions *within the same browser and on the same device*.  `localStorage` stores data with no expiration date, meaning the ID will remain available until explicitly deleted by the user, the browser settings are cleared, or the application intentionally removes it.

Limitations:

*   **Browser-Specific:** `localStorage` is specific to the browser instance.  If the user accesses the application from a different browser (e.g., Chrome vs. Firefox) or in a private browsing mode, a new client ID will be generated.
*   **Device-Specific:** The ID is tied to the device.  If the user switches devices (e.g., laptop to mobile phone), a new client ID is generated.
*   **Limited Storage Capacity:** `localStorage` has a limited storage capacity (typically around 5-10MB), although this is unlikely to be a problem for a single client ID.
*   **Security Risks:** `localStorage` is accessible to JavaScript running on the same domain.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could potentially allow attackers to access or modify the stored client ID.

Alternative Storage Mechanisms:

*   **Cookies:** Cookies are another client-side storage option, but they have smaller storage capacity and are sent with every HTTP request, potentially impacting performance.
*   **IndexedDB:** IndexedDB offers a more robust and larger-capacity client-side storage solution, suitable for complex data.  However, it's more complex to use than `localStorage`.
*   **Server-Side Storage:** The most reliable and secure approach is to store the client ID on the server (e.g., in a database) and associate it with a unique user identifier (e.g., a session ID or a user account).  This ensures that the client ID is consistent across all devices and browsers, and provides greater security against tampering. The client would then retrieve the ID from the server upon each session.
*   **Web SQL (Deprecated):**  Avoid using Web SQL, as it's deprecated and no longer actively maintained.
