The `public` keyword before each parameter in the constructor automatically creates and initializes a property with the same name on the `HeatingEntity` class instance. This is a shorthand way of declaring and assigning values to class properties directly within the constructor parameters. It avoids the need for separate property declarations and assignment statements inside the constructor body, making the code more concise. Effectively, it's a TypeScript feature that combines declaration and initialization.
