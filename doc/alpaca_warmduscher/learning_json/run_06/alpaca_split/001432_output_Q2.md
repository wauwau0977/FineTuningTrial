```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "InfoBean{" +
            "deviceName='" + deviceName + '\'' +
            ", buildVersionServer='" + buildVersionServer + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```

Reasons for excluding the `buildTimestampServer` field:

*   **Sensitive Information:** The build timestamp might reveal information about the deployment environment or internal build process that you don't want to expose in logs or debugging output.
*   **Log Verbosity:**  Including unnecessary details can make logs harder to read and analyze.
*   **Data Privacy:** Depending on the context, the timestamp could be considered sensitive data.
*   **Debugging Simplification:** Focusing only on relevant information can simplify debugging and troubleshooting.
*   **API Contracts:** If `toString()` is used as part of an API or data exchange format, you might want to control exactly which fields are included.
