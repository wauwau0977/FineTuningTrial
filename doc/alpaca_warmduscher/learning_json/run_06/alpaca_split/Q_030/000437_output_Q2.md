`shareReplay(1)` is an RxJS operator that allows multiple subscribers to share the same observable execution. The `1` indicates that it will "replay" the last emitted value to any new subscriber. 

In this context, it's crucial for ensuring that multiple components requesting the same cached data don't each trigger a new execution of the `loader()` observable. Without `shareReplay(1)`, each call to `get` with the same `cacheKey` would create a *new* observable stream from `loader()`, even if a previous stream was already in progress or completed. This would defeat the purpose of caching, as it would repeatedly fetch data from the source.

If you removed `shareReplay(1)`, the following would happen:

1.  **Multiple Requests = Multiple Fetches:** Each component requesting data with the same `cacheKey` would trigger a new execution of the `loader()` function.  This would lead to redundant network requests, increased load on the server, and potentially inconsistent data if the data changes between requests.
2.  **No Shared Observable:**  Each component would have its own independent observable stream.  There would be no way to share the results of the `loader()` execution among multiple subscribers.
3.  **Race Conditions:** If multiple requests arrive simultaneously, they could initiate multiple concurrent requests to the data source before any of them complete, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
