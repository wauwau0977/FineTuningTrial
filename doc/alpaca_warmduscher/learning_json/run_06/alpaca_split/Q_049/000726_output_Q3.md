The purpose of initializing `t0` to `System.currentTimeMillis() - 1` is to establish a baseline timestamp slightly in the past.  This baseline is then used within the `getData()` method to calculate a relative time difference (`dtS`). Subtracting 1 millisecond from the current time ensures that `dtS` will always be a positive value, even on the very first call to `getData()`, preventing potential issues or unexpected results. It essentially creates a small offset so that the mock data generation starts from a time slightly before the actual current time, making the mock data seem more realistic by allowing it to progress from a starting point.  Without the subtraction, the first call to `getData()` could result in `dtS` being zero, leading to potentially invalid or unchanging mock data values.
