You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface `BoilerStatsByHour` defines a data structure to represent aggregated boiler statistics for each hour of the day. It provides accessors for the hour, sum of boiler difference decreases, sum of boiler difference increases, and the number of statistic records used in the aggregation. This is likely used for generating reports or visualizations of boiler performance over time.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerStatsByHour`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Define the structure for retrieving hourly boiler statistics. It acts as a data transfer object (DTO) or a contract for data coming from a database or other source.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This interface doesn't directly handle user inputs. It *defines* the output structure â€“ the data that will be provided to other parts of the application.
- **Workflow/Logic**:  The interface itself doesn't have any inherent workflow or logic.  The *implementation* of this interface would be responsible for collecting and aggregating the data.
- **External Interactions**: No direct external interactions. An implementation would likely interact with a database or data source to retrieve and calculate the statistics.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Since it's an interface, it doesn't handle edge cases directly. Implementations must handle scenarios like missing data, invalid inputs, or database errors.  Returning appropriate default values (e.g., 0.0 or `null`) for missing values is expected.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Accessing the data through the getter methods should be fast, as these are simple data access operations.
- **Scalability**: The interface itself is not a scalability concern. Scalability depends on the underlying data source and the implementation that populates this interface.
- **Security**:  No direct security concerns related to the interface itself. The data accessed might have security implications, which should be handled by the underlying data source and access control mechanisms.
- **Maintainability**: The interface is simple and well-defined, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The interface relies on the reliability and availability of the underlying data source and implementation.
- **Usability**: The interface is easy to use as it provides simple getter methods for accessing the data.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements for the interface itself.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `getHourOfTheDay()`: Returns the hour of the day (Integer).
    - `getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()`: Returns the sum of boiler temperature decreases during that hour (Double).
    - `getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`: Returns the sum of boiler temperature increases during that hour (Double).
    - `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`: Returns the number of statistic records used to calculate these values (Long).
- **Important logic flows**:  No direct logic flow within the interface. The logic resides in the implementing class.
- **Error handling**: Not applicable at the interface level.
- **Classes**: This is an interface, so no subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: This is part of the `thserver` module, specifically within the `db.entity.analytics` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Basic Java data types (Integer, Double, Long)
- Interfaces

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonPropertyOrder`: Used for controlling the order of properties when serializing this object to JSON.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly stated, but likely dependent on other modules/classes responsible for data retrieval and aggregation.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Data Validation**:  While not part of the interface, the implementing class should include validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Units**: Consider adding constants or enums to define the units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit) for the temperature differences.  This improves clarity and prevents potential errors.
- **Extensibility**: If more statistics are needed in the future, consider how the interface can be extended without breaking existing code.  Perhaps using a `Map` to store additional statistics could provide flexibility.
- **Comments/Documentation**:  Adding JavaDoc comments to the interface and its methods would improve readability and maintainability.
