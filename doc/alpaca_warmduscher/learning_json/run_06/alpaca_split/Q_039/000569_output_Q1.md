The `::ng-deep` selector is used to pierce the component's view encapsulation and apply styles to descendant elements within that component's template, even if those elements are part of other components. In this specific code, it targets the `.mat-card-header-text` element *within* the `.myHeader` component, allowing the developer to override its default margin-left property.

However, `::ng-deep` is deprecated. The main issue is that it breaks encapsulation, which is a core principle of component-based architecture. This means styles defined with `::ng-deep` can unintentionally affect other components, leading to unexpected side effects and making the application harder to maintain and reason about.  Angular recommends using alternative approaches like CSS variables, `@Host` bindings, or component communication (using `@Input` and `@Output`) to achieve the desired styling effects without sacrificing encapsulation. The comment acknowledges this problem, highlighting the difficulty in achieving the desired styling without it currently. A refactor should be planned to eliminate this dependency.
