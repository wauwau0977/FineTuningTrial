```java
public GlobalSynced(T syncedObject, Hooks<T> hooks) {
    // 'syncedObject' is the object that will be protected by the mutex.
    // It's the shared resource that multiple threads might access.
    this.syncedObject = syncedObject;

    // 'hooks' is an optional object that allows for pre- and post-operation
    // logic to be executed on the syncedObject. This provides a mechanism
    // for extending the functionality of the class without modifying its core logic.
    this.hooks = hooks;
}
```
The `GlobalSynced` class is a utility designed to provide thread-safe access to a shared object, `T`. It uses a `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can operate on the `syncedObject` at any given time.  The `Hooks` interface allows for custom logic to be executed before and after operations on the `syncedObject`, providing a flexible extension point.

Member Variable Roles:

*   `log`: A Logger instance for logging errors and debug information.
*   `reentrantLock`: A `ReentrantLock` used for synchronization, preventing concurrent access to the `syncedObject`.
*   `syncedObject`: The shared object that is protected by the mutex. This is the resource that multiple threads may attempt to access concurrently.
*   `hooks`: An optional `Hooks` object that allows for custom pre- and post-operation logic.
