The comment indicates that the author is aware of a potential code duplication issue. The margin styles applied to `.mat-card` are also likely defined in `global styles.sass`. This is a common problem in CSS, leading to several issues:

*   **Maintainability:** If the margin needs to be changed, the author must remember to modify it in multiple places, increasing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Code Size:** Duplicated styles inflate the CSS file size, impacting performance.
*   **Specificity Conflicts:**  If the global styles have higher specificity, they might override the styles in `about.component.sass`, or vice versa, causing unexpected behavior.

The author's comment is a self-assessment, acknowledging that the current approach may not be ideal. They are questioning whether the repetition is necessary or if the global styles should be relied upon instead. A better approach would be to remove the margin styles from `about.component.sass` and rely solely on the global styles, or to utilize CSS variables to centralize the margin value.
