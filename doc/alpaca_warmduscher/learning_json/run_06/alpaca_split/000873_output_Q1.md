The use of both primitive and wrapper types introduces potential null value handling complexities. Primitive types like `double` and `int` cannot be null.  However, `Double` and `Boolean` can be null. This means that if these values are not explicitly set, they will default to `null`.

This difference necessitates careful null checks in the application logic. Operations on `Double` or `Boolean` fields *must* account for the possibility of `null` to prevent `NullPointerException` errors.  For example, attempting to perform arithmetic on a `Double` that is `null` will cause an error.

This mixed approach can also lead to ambiguity and potentially introduce subtle bugs if not handled carefully. Consistent use of either primitive or wrapper types would simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.  A good rule of thumb is to use wrapper types only when a null value is a meaningful representation of the data; otherwise, use primitive types.
