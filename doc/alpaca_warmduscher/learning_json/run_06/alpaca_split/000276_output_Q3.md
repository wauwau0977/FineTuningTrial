The `Interval.compare` and `Interval.sort` methods are designed to compare and sort `Interval` objects based on their `intervalInSeconcs` property.

*   **`Interval.compare(a: Interval, b: Interval): number`**:  This method takes two `Interval` objects as input and returns a numerical value indicating their relative order.
    *   If `a` or `b` is null/undefined, it returns 0, handling potentially missing intervals gracefully.
    *   If `a.intervalInSeconcs` is equal to `b.intervalInSeconcs`, it returns 0.
    *   If `a.intervalInSeconcs` is greater than `b.intervalInSeconcs`, it returns 1.
    *   If `a.intervalInSeconcs` is less than `b.intervalInSeconcs`, it returns -1.

    Essentially, it implements a comparison function for sorting based on the `intervalInSeconcs` value.

*   **`Interval.sort(intervals: Interval[])`**: This method takes an array of `Interval` objects and sorts them in ascending order based on their `intervalInSeconcs` property. It uses the built-in JavaScript `Array.sort()` method and provides the `Interval.compare` function as a comparator to define the sorting logic.

**Why both are needed:**

The `Array.sort()` method requires a comparison function to determine the order of elements.  `Interval.compare` provides this custom comparison logic specifically tailored for `Interval` objects, ensuring they are sorted correctly based on their time interval duration.  `Interval.sort` is a convenience method that encapsulates the call to `Array.sort()` with the correct comparator, making it easier to sort arrays of `Interval` objects. They work together to provide a clear and reusable way to sort intervals in ascending order by their duration.
