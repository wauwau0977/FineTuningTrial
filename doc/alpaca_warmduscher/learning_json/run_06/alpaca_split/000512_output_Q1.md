Relying on an external service like `HeatingDataService` for date conversion introduces a dependency and potential points of failure. If `HeatingDataService` becomes unavailable, or if its `convertDate()` method changes its behavior, it could break the `ofWebService()` method. To mitigate this, consider the following: 1) Unit test `ofWebService()` with mocked versions of `HeatingDataService` to ensure it handles different date formats and potential errors correctly. 2) Implement a fallback mechanism, such as a default date parsing function, in case `HeatingDataService` fails. 3) Ensure clear communication and versioning between the teams responsible for `HeatingDataService` and this entity to manage changes effectively. 4) If possible, encapsulate the date conversion logic within this entity, potentially using a well-established date library like Moment.js or Date-fns to reduce external dependencies.
