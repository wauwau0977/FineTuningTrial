Setting "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*" is a wildcard that allows any origin to access the resource. This significantly weakens the security of the API as it bypasses the Same-Origin Policy, potentially allowing malicious websites to make requests on behalf of authenticated users.

To restrict access to specific origins, you should replace the "*" with a comma-separated list of allowed origins, or dynamically determine the allowed origin based on the requesting origin.  Here's a modified code snippet that demonstrates the latter approach, allowing `http://example.com` and `http://localhost:3000`:

```java
@Override
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
    HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
    String origin = ((HttpServletRequest) request).getHeader("Origin");

    if (origin != null && (origin.equals("http://example.com") || origin.equals("http://localhost:3000"))) {
        httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
    } else {
        httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // Or deny access entirely
        //Alternatively could throw an exception or return an error response
    }

    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, *, X-Requested-With");
    httpResponse.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, OPTIONS");

    chain.doFilter(request, response);
}
```

This updated code reads the `Origin` header from the request. If the origin matches one of the allowed origins, it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header accordingly.  If not, it either sets it to '*' (allowing access for unknown origins â€“ potentially undesirable) or could be modified to deny access entirely, for example, by returning a 403 Forbidden response.  This approach provides a more secure and controlled access policy.
