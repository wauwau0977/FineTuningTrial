For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
@Component
public class StartupData {
   private long startupTimeTakenInMillis;
```
What is the purpose of the `@Component` annotation in this Java class, and how does it relate to Spring Framework functionality?
