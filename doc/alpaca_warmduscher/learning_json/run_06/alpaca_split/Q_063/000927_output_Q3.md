Overriding the `toString()` method provides a custom string representation of the `SessionRequest` object. The default `toString()` implementation inherited from `Object` typically returns a cryptic string like "SessionRequest@1a2b3c4d". The overridden method provides a much more human-readable representation of the object's key attributes.

This implementation specifically includes the `processingTime`, `id`, `sessionId`, `clientId`, `httpStatus`, `ip`, and `path` attributes.

This custom `toString()` method contributes significantly to debugging and logging in the following ways:

*   **Easier Debugging:** When debugging, you can easily print a `SessionRequest` object to the console or log file, and the output will show the values of its important fields, making it much easier to understand the object's state.
*   **Improved Logging:** When logging `SessionRequest` objects, the custom `toString()` method ensures that the logged messages contain relevant information about the request, making it easier to analyze application behavior and identify potential issues.
*   **Readability:** The format of the output is designed to be easily readable by developers, making it easier to quickly scan the logs and identify important information.
*   **Simplified Object Inspection:** Using the `toString()` method allows you to easily inspect the objectâ€™s state during development and testing without needing to manually access each field.
