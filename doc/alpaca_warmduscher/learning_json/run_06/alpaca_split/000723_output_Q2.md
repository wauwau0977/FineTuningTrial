Spring Profiles are a mechanism for configuring different beans and settings based on the current environment. They allow you to have different configurations for development, testing, production, and other environments without modifying the core code.

**Purpose:**

*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Profiles enable you to define environment-specific beans. Beans associated with a particular profile are only created when that profile is active.
*   **Conditional Bean Creation:** You can conditionally create beans based on which profiles are active.
*   **Simplified Testing:** Profiles simplify testing by allowing you to easily switch between different configurations (e.g., using an in-memory database for tests instead of a real database).
*   **Deployment Flexibility:** Enables different deployments for different environments without code changes.

**How it affects execution:**

In this case, the `@Profile(Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK)` annotation on `MeteoDataMockImpl` means that this implementation of `MeteoDataService` will *only* be used when the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile is active. If the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile is not active, Spring will look for another implementation of `MeteoDataService` (potentially a real implementation that connects to MeteoSwiss) to use.

**Configurations to activate this implementation:**

To use `MeteoDataMockImpl`, the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile must be activated. There are several ways to do this:

1.  **Command Line Argument:** When running the application, you can pass the `-Dspring.profiles.active=SENSOR_MOCK` JVM argument.
2.  **Environment Variable:** Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to `SENSOR_MOCK`.
3.  **Spring Boot Configuration File:**  In your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, set the `spring.profiles.active` property to `SENSOR_MOCK`.
    ```properties
    spring.profiles.active=SENSOR_MOCK
    ```
4.  **Programmatically:**  You can activate profiles programmatically using the `SpringProfileEnvironment` or `DefaultProfileResolver`.

If none of these are set, Spring will use the default profile, which may not include this mock implementation.
