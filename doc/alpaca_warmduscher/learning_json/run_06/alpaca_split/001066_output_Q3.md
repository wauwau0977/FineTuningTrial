The `scanAllRegisters` method, as indicated by its name, likely represents a function that would normally scan and retrieve data from all available registers of a heating system device. In a real implementation, this method would presumably interact with the physical device (or a simulated device) to read register values and return them as a list of strings.

However, the current implementation simply returns a list containing the single string "Not implemented". This indicates that the `HeatingDataReadServiceMock` class is a simplified mock and does *not* provide functionality for scanning registers. This is consistent with its role as a mock service, as the focus is likely on providing basic data for testing or demonstration purposes, rather than implementing the full functionality of a real heating data reading service. The method is present to satisfy the interface contract (implement `HeatingDataReadService`), but is deliberately left unimplemented.
