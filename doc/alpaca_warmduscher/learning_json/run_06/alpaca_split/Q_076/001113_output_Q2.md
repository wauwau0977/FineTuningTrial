Hardcoding the properties like `host`, `port`, and `socketFactory` directly in the code creates several issues:

*   **Lack of Flexibility:**  Any change to the email server configuration (e.g., different port, hostname, or switching to a different provider) requires code changes and redeployment.
*   **Difficulty in Testing:**  Testing becomes harder as you cannot easily switch to a mock or test email server without modifying the code.
*   **Configuration Management:**  The configuration is tied to the code, making it difficult to manage across different environments (development, testing, production).
*   **Maintainability:**  Changes are difficult and prone to errors as you must directly modify the code.

**Improvements:**

The best approach is to externalize these properties using Springâ€™s configuration mechanism:

1.  **`application.properties` or `application.yml`:** Define the properties in one of these files:

    ```properties
    thserver.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
    thserver.mail.port=587
    thserver.mail.socketFactory.class=javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory
    ```

2.  **`@Value` Annotation:** Use the `@Value` annotation to inject the properties into the `MailSend` class:

    ```java
    @Value("${thserver.mail.host}")
    private String host;

    @Value("${thserver.mail.port}")
    private String port;

    @Value("${thserver.mail.socketFactory.class}")
    private String socketFactoryClass;
    ```

3.  **Use Injected Values:** Use the injected values in the `send` method:

    ```java
    prop.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.port", port);
    prop.put("mail.smtp.socketFactory.class", socketFactoryClass);
    prop.put("mail.smtp.host", host);
    ```

This approach allows you to:

*   Change the email server configuration without modifying the code.
*   Manage different configurations for different environments.
*   Make the code more testable by using different configurations in tests.
*   Improve code readability and maintainability.
