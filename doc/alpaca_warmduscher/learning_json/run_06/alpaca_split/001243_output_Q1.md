Using an interface like `MutexOperation` offers several advantages. Primarily, it decouples the synchronization logic from the actual operation being performed. This enhances maintainability, as changes to the synchronization mechanism don't necessitate changes to the operation code, and vice versa.  Testability is significantly improved; we can easily mock or stub a `MutexOperation` for unit testing without involving the complexities of the real operation.  Flexibility is increased because different operations can be implemented as different classes adhering to this interface.  A lambda or method reference directly tied to the synchronization would lack this separation of concerns and make testing/modification more cumbersome. The interface promotes the principle of "Program to interfaces, not implementations," improving code structure and extensibility.
