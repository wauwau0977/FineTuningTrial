`fixture.detectChanges()` triggers Angular's change detection mechanism. It instructs Angular to update the component's view (the rendered HTML) based on the current component's state.  

In the 'should render title' test, the component's view hasn't been rendered yet after creating the fixture with `TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent)`.  The component's template hasn't been processed, and the HTML hasn't been created in the DOM. `fixture.detectChanges()` forces Angular to run the component's change detection, which binds data to the template, and creates the actual DOM elements of the component.

Without `fixture.detectChanges()`, `compiled.querySelector('.content span')` would return `null` because the element doesn't exist in the DOM yet.  The test relies on the presence of that element to verify the rendered title, so change detection *must* be triggered first.
