The generic type parameter `T` represents the type of the object that the `before` and `after` hooks will operate on. It allows the interface to be used with any object type, providing type safety and flexibility. It avoids the need for casting and allows the hooks to access the object's specific properties and methods.

Example:

Let's say we have a `SensorData` class:

```java
class SensorData {
   private double temperature;
   private double humidity;

   public SensorData(double temperature, double humidity) {
      this.temperature = temperature;
      this.humidity = humidity;
   }

   public double getTemperature() { return temperature; }
   public double getHumidity() { return humidity; }
}
```

We can create a `Hooks` implementation that logs sensor data before and after processing:

```java
public class SensorDataHooks implements Hooks<SensorData> {
   @Override
   public void before(SensorData data) throws Throwable {
      System.out.println("Before processing: Temperature = " + data.getTemperature() + ", Humidity = " + data.getHumidity());
   }

   @Override
   public void after(SensorData data) throws Throwable {
      System.out.println("After processing: Temperature = " + data.getTemperature() + ", Humidity = " + data.getHumidity());
   }
}
```

In this case, `T` is `SensorData`, and the hooks are specifically designed to work with objects of that type.  This keeps the code type-safe and allows the hooks to directly access the `temperature` and `humidity` properties of the `SensorData` object.
