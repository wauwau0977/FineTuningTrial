The potential overflow issue arises from the division operation. `Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()` returns a `long` value, representing the free memory in bytes. Dividing this `long` by `kB` (which is 1024) results in another `long`. However, if `Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()` is very close to the maximum value of a `long`, the division might lead to truncation, potentially resulting in a negative value being assigned to `freeMemoryKb`.  While less likely, it's possible, and even small inaccuracies are undesirable.

Here are a couple of ways to address it:

1. **Cast to `double` before division:** The most robust solution is to cast either `Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()` or `kB` to a `double` before performing the division:

   ```java
   memoryInfo.setFreeMemoryKb((double)Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() / kB);
   ```

   This ensures that the division is performed using floating-point arithmetic, avoiding integer truncation. The result can then be cast back to `long` if necessary, but the initial division will be more accurate.

2. **Use `Math.floorDiv()` (Java 8+):** If you're using Java 8 or later, you can use `Math.floorDiv()` to perform integer division that rounds towards negative infinity:

   ```java
   memoryInfo.setFreeMemoryKb(Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() / kB); //Corrected, the division result is still a long, which handles the overflow/truncation safely.
   ```
   Note that integer division in Java truncates towards zero.

Given that we are assigning to a long, the long division already handles the overflow/truncation safely. It will result in a potentially smaller number. This is not an overflow but rather a truncation/underflow. No overflow happens, the result is still a long.
