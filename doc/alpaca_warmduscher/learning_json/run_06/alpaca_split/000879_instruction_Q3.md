For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
private double boilerTemp;
private int compressorHours;
private double heatingIn;
private double heatingOut;
```
Considering these fields represent data read from a heat pump, what type of data does each field likely store, and why were specific primitive data types (double and int) chosen for them?
