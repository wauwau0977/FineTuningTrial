The `.myLoadingSpinner` class defines a loading spinner that starts invisible and fades in slightly. The `position: absolute` places the spinner relative to its containing element. The `width` and `height` set the dimensions of the spinner. The `animation: fadeIn 500ms linear forwards` applies a 500ms animation named `fadeIn` with a linear timing function and the `forwards` keyword which ensures the spinner stays at its final state after the animation.

The `@keyframes fadeIn` rule controls the animationâ€™s progression. Initially (0%), the `opacity` is 0, making the spinner completely invisible. At 50% of the animation duration, the `opacity` remains at 0. Finally, at 100%, the `opacity` is set to 0.6, causing the spinner to become partially visible. The `zoom: 0.5` scales the spinner down to half its original size.

The intentional choice to keep the opacity at 0 for the first half of the animation and only partially reveal it at the end suggests a subtle fade-in effect. The spinner doesn't abruptly appear; instead, it gradually becomes visible, creating a less jarring user experience. The `zoom` property further contributes to a more refined entrance by scaling it down initially. It's designed to be a discreet indicator, rather than a prominent, in-your-face animation.
