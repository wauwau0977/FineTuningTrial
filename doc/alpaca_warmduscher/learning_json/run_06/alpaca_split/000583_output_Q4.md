```sass
.spacer
  margin-bottom: 15px
  border-bottom: 1px dotted #ccc
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`border-bottom: 1px dotted #ccc;`**: This line adds a border to the bottom of elements with the class `.spacer`.
    *   **`1px`**: Sets the border width to 1 pixel, creating a subtle line.
    *   **`dotted`**: Specifies the border style as dotted, providing a visual indication of separation without being overly prominent.
    *   **`#ccc`**: Sets the border color to light gray (`#ccc`). This is a neutral color that blends well with most backgrounds and contributes to the subtlety of the border. Other options could be using a more specific color, or even an rgba value to control opacity.

I chose these values because the requirement specifically asked for a *subtle* border. A solid or double border would be too visually strong. The light gray color is unobtrusive and complements the existing styles. Adding the border directly to the `.spacer` class leverages the existing selector, keeping the SASS concise and maintainable.
