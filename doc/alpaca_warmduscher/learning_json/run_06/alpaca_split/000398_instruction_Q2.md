For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.ts'... 

Examine the following code snippet:

```typescript
chartOptionsBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek: Highcharts.Options = {
   // ... (other configurations) ...
   series: [{
     name: 'Boiler Gebrauch nach Wochentag',
     type: 'column',
     data: this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek,
   }],
   // ... (other configurations) ...
}
```

What type of chart is being created based on this configuration? How does this chart visualize the data in `this.boilerStatsByDayOfWeek`, and what data is expected in this array? Explain how the 'categories' array, defined in the `xAxis` configuration, impacts the visualization and what it represents.
