There are several ways to extend this repository with custom queries and logic:

1. **Query Methods:** Define methods within the interface with names that follow Spring Data JPA's naming conventions (e.g., `findByDeviceId(String deviceId)`). Spring Data JPA will automatically generate the corresponding query based on the method name.
2. **@Query Annotation:** Use the `@Query` annotation to specify a custom JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL query. This allows for more complex queries that aren't easily expressed through naming conventions.
3. **Derived Query Methods with Parameters:** Use parameters within query method names (e.g., `findByDeviceIdAndStatus(String deviceId, String status)`).
4. **@Transactional methods on an Implementation:** Create a concrete implementation of the `SessionDeviceRepository` interface, and add `@Transactional` methods to encapsulate business logic involving multiple database operations. This ensures atomicity and consistency.
5. **Custom Repository Implementation:** For complex scenarios, create a custom repository implementation by extending a base repository interface (e.g., `JpaRepositoryImpl`) and providing custom implementations for specific methods. This gives you the most flexibility and control.
