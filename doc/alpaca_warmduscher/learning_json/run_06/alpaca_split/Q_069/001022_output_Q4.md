```java
/**
 * Sets the unique identifier for this MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.
 *
 * This method assigns a value to the `id` field, which serves as the primary key
 * for this entity in the database. The id is initialized using `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()`
 * to ensure uniqueness and is used for identifying and retrieving specific statistics entries.
 * This method is likely provided to allow external modification of the ID, though it's not typical
 * for immutable entities.
 *
 * @param id The unique identifier to set for this entity.
 */
public void setId(String id) {
    this.id = id;
}
```

The `id` is initialized in the constructor (not shown in the provided snippet but standard for this type of entity) with `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` to guarantee a unique identifier for each `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` instance. Using a UUID ensures that even if multiple instances are created simultaneously or in different parts of the system, they will have distinct IDs. The 'short' part likely refers to a shorter UUID format for storage efficiency.
