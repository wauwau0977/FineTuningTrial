Using a `String` as a primary key has both advantages and disadvantages compared to a `Long`.

**Advantages:**

*   **Natural Keys:** If the `SessionRequest` already has a unique identifier in a natural format (e.g., a UUID, a session ID generated by another system), using that as the primary key can simplify data integration and avoid the need for artificial key management.
*   **Human Readability:** String keys can be more easily inspected and debugged, as they are often more meaningful than numeric IDs.
*   **Flexibility:**  String keys can accommodate more complex key formats and potentially include validation logic.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Storage Space:** Strings typically require more storage space than numeric types.
*   **Performance:** String comparisons are generally slower than numeric comparisons, which can impact query performance, particularly for large tables.  Indexing string columns can mitigate this, but may still be slower.
*   **Database Compatibility:** Some databases have limitations on the length or character set of string primary keys.
*   **Auto-generation:**  It's less common to have databases auto-generate String primary keys. Auto-increment generally works better with numeric types.

In the context of `SessionRequest`, using a String might be reasonable if session IDs are already generated externally. However, if the IDs are generated internally, a `Long` would likely be more efficient.
