For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
   Date getMeasurementDateStart();
   Date getMeasurementDateEnd();
   Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg();
   Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMin();
   Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMax();
   Boolean getCompressorState();
   Integer getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow();
```
These methods represent accessors (getters) for properties of the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface. What does the use of an interface, rather than a concrete class, suggest about the design intent, and what benefits does it offer?
