The `it('should create', () => { expect(component).toBeTruthy(); });` test is a basic smoke test. It verifies that the component can be instantiated without throwing an error.  It's a minimal check to ensure the component's basic setup is functional.

To ensure the `OverviewCurrentComponent` is functioning correctly, I would add the following tests:

*   **Template Rendering Test:** Verify that the componentâ€™s template renders correctly. This involves checking for the presence of expected HTML elements and attributes.
*   **Data Binding Tests:** If the component displays data, tests should verify that the data is correctly bound to the template. This might involve setting different input values and asserting that the corresponding changes are reflected in the view.
*   **Event Handling Tests:** If the component has event handlers (e.g., button clicks), tests should verify that these handlers are called when the corresponding events occur and that they trigger the expected behavior.
*   **Component Input Tests:**  If the component receives inputs (`@Input()`), tests should verify that these inputs are correctly processed and affect the component's behavior or displayed data.
*   **Service Interaction Tests:** If the component interacts with services, I'd mock those services and verify that the component calls the correct methods on those services with the expected parameters.
*   **Lifecycle Hook Tests:** If the component utilizes lifecycle hooks (e.g., `ngOnInit`), tests should verify that these hooks are called at the appropriate times and perform the expected actions.
