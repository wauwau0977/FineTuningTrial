The `dayOfWeekStartingMonday` property being a number (presumably 0-6) representing the day of the week, starting with Monday, is a deliberate design choice. It's efficient in terms of storage and allows for easy numeric comparisons or calculations (e.g., calculating the day difference between two dates). However, it introduces a dependency on this numeric representation within any code that *uses* this entity.  

From a maintainability perspective, it means that any code referencing this property needs to know that 0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, etc.  If the representation ever needs to change (e.g., to an enum or string for better readability), all consuming code will need to be updated. Using an enum would improve readability and reduce the risk of errors from incorrect numeric values but would require more extensive changes initially.  A string representation would be even more readable but potentially less efficient.
