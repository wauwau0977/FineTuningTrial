This interceptor, `MyHttpInterceptor`, is designed to add specific headers to all outgoing HTTP requests made by the Angular application. Specifically, it adds a `clientId` and a `clientVersion` header to each request before it's sent to the server. The `clientId` is retrieved from the `ClientIdService`, and the `clientVersion` is read from the `environment.buildTimestampClient` constant. This provides a way to identify the client making the request and its version.

The potential benefits include:

*   **Client Identification:** The server can identify the client making the request, which is useful for debugging, analytics, and potentially feature flagging.
*   **Version Tracking:**  Knowing the client version allows the server to adapt responses or behavior based on the client's capabilities, ensuring compatibility and handling different client versions gracefully.
*   **Security:** While not a primary security measure, client identification can contribute to fraud detection or abuse prevention.
*   **Centralized Header Management:**  This approach avoids having to manually add these headers to every HTTP request in the application, centralizing the logic in a single interceptor. This improves maintainability and reduces the risk of errors.
