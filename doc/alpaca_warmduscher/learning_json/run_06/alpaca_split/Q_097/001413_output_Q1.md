The `@RequestMapping` annotation is a core component of Spring MVC. In this `InfoService` class, it's used to map incoming HTTP requests to specific handler methods.  The `@RequestMapping("/info")` at the class level defines a base URL for all requests handled by this controller.  Then, `@RequestMapping("/general")` and `@RequestMapping("/memory")` within the methods refine that base URL.  So, a request to `/info/general` will be routed to the `getInfo()` method, and `/info/memory` will route to `getMemoryInfo()`.  Essentially, it's how Spring knows *which* method should handle a given HTTP request, making this service a RESTful endpoint.
