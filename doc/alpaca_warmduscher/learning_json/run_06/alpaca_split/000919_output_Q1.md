This design has significant consequences. Relying solely on `id` for `equals()` and `hashCode()` means that two `SessionRequest` objects with different `id` values will *always* be considered unequal, even if all other fields (sessionId, clientId, requestDate, etc.) are identical. 

This could lead to incorrect behavior in scenarios where the application needs to compare objects based on their business data, such as checking for duplicate requests or using the `SessionRequest` object as a key in a `HashMap` or `HashSet`. The application might treat two logically identical requests as distinct, or it might lose data when using these objects in collections. A more robust implementation should consider all relevant fields when implementing `equals()` and `hashCode()`, or at least the fields that define the business key for the object.
