Currently, the CORS configuration is hardcoded within the `CorsFilter` class. In a real-world application, it would be much better to move this configuration to an externalized location, such as application properties (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) or a dedicated configuration file.

Here's why:

*   **Centralized Management:** Moving the configuration allows for centralized management of CORS settings for the entire application. This makes it easier to update or modify the configuration without having to change and redeploy the code.
*   **Environment-Specific Settings:** Different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) might require different CORS settings. Externalizing the configuration allows you to easily load environment-specific settings without modifying the code.
*   **Configuration Management Tools:**  Externalized configuration integrates well with configuration management tools (e.g., Spring Cloud Config, HashiCorp Vault), enabling dynamic configuration updates and secrets management.
*   **Improved Testability:** Using externalized configuration makes it easier to test the application with different CORS settings.

A potential refactoring approach would involve creating a `@ConfigurationProperties` class that maps the properties to the CORS settings, and injecting those settings into the `CorsFilter`.  This promotes loose coupling and enhances maintainability.
