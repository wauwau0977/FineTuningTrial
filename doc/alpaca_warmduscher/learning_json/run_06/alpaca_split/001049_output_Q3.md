Defining `HeatingDataReadService` as an interface provides several benefits related to flexibility, testability, and maintainability.

1.  **Abstraction:** The interface defines *what* the service should do (init, getData, scanAllRegisters) without specifying *how* it should be done. This allows for different implementations of the service to be swapped in without affecting any code that uses the interface.

2.  **Dependency Injection/Inversion of Control:**  It enables dependency injection.  Classes that rely on heating data reading can depend on the *interface* rather than a specific implementation. This makes the code more loosely coupled and easier to test (using mock implementations).

3.  **Testability:**  By decoupling the interface from a concrete implementation, it becomes straightforward to create mock implementations of `HeatingDataReadService` for unit testing. This allows developers to isolate and test other parts of the system without needing to interact with actual heating data sources or hardware.

4.  **Polymorphism:**  Multiple implementations of the `HeatingDataReadService` interface can be provided, each suited for different data sources or reading strategies. This allows the application to adapt to changing requirements or support different types of heating systems without modifying the consuming code.

5.  **Maintainability:** Changes to the implementation details of the heating data reading process can be made without requiring changes to the code that relies on the interface.  This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes the code easier to maintain over time.
