The `@Profile(Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK)` annotation indicates that this `HeatingDataReadServiceMock` component should only be instantiated and used when the application is run with the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile active. Spring's profile system allows different configurations to be loaded based on the active profile(s). 

If the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile wasn't active, Spring wouldn’t instantiate this specific implementation of `HeatingDataReadService`. Instead, it would look for another `@Component` implementing the `HeatingDataReadService` interface that *doesn’t* have a profile restriction, or it would throw an exception if no suitable implementation is found.  This allows for easy switching between mock data (like in this class) and a real implementation that reads data from a sensor, without changing the code.  This is a key pattern for testing and environment-specific configuration.
