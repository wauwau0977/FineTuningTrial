`fixture.detectChanges()` triggers Angular's change detection mechanism.  This is crucial because it tells Angular to update the component's view after any changes to its input properties or internal state. Essentially, it renders the component’s template based on the current state of the component.

If `fixture.detectChanges()` was removed, the component’s view would *not* be updated after the component instance is created in the `beforeEach` block. Any changes made to the component's properties or data would not be reflected in the rendered template. This would cause the tests to fail or produce incorrect results because the assertions would be comparing against the initial, unchanged view.  For example, if the component was supposed to display a value that’s dynamically updated, the test would likely see the initial value (or no value at all) instead of the updated one. It’s important to call `detectChanges()` after any action that modifies the component’s data or state.
