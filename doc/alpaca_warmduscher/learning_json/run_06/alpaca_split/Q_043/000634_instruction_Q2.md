For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts' with name 'environment.ts'... 
The file contains the following line:

```typescript
serviceBaseURL: "https://www.mindalyze.com/pi11/",
```

Assuming this URL is used to make API calls, discuss potential security implications of hardcoding this URL directly into the `environment.ts` file, especially in a production environment.  What alternative approaches could be used to manage this URL more securely?
