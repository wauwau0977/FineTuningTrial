The `::ng-deep` selector is used to pierce the encapsulation barrier of Angular components and apply styles to elements within a child component's view. In this case, it's attempting to modify the `margin-left` of `.mat-card-header-text` elements *inside* the `.myHeader` component, potentially a Material Design card header.

It's noted as deprecated because Angular's recommended approach to component styling emphasizes encapsulation. `::ng-deep` bypasses this encapsulation, making the application more susceptible to unintended style conflicts and making refactoring more difficult. The comments point to Angular's documentation highlighting the issues and alternative approaches like CSS variables or using a shared theming system. While it "works" in this instance, using it introduces a maintenance risk and suggests a deeper architectural issue with how styles are being managed. It's essentially a workaround for a problem that Angular discourages solving this way.
