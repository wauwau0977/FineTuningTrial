`@EnableWebMvc` is an annotation that enables Spring's default web message converters, validation, and formatters. It essentially bootstraps a more comprehensive Spring MVC configuration.

It's discouraged here because the Spring Boot application is likely already providing a default MVC configuration.  Spring Boot’s auto-configuration intelligently sets up a default `WebMvcConfigurer` if one isn't explicitly defined.  Adding `@EnableWebMvc` would *replace* that auto-configured setup with a default one specified by `@EnableWebMvc`. This can lead to conflicts with Spring Boot’s application properties (defined in `application.properties` or `application.yml`) and potentially break critical functionality that relies on the auto-configured defaults, like view resolution, message handling, or resource mappings. Spring Boot is designed to avoid unnecessary explicit configuration when possible, and this annotation would undo that design.
