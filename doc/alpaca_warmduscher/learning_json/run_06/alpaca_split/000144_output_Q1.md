The current approach of using a single value in the `environment` file is adequate, but to manage different intervals per environment, the `environment` file should be structured as a JavaScript object with environment-specific configurations.  We'd typically have separate files for each environment (e.g., `environment.dev.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`, `environment.staging.ts`).

Hereâ€™s an example structure for `environment.ts` (base configuration):

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 60 // Default value for development
};
```

Then, for production:

```typescript
// environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 300 // 5 minutes
};
```

And for staging:

```typescript
// environment.staging.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 120 // 2 minutes
};
```

During the build process, the Angular CLI will automatically use the correct `environment.*.ts` file based on the `--configuration` flag (e.g., `ng build --configuration production`).  This ensures that the appropriate refresh interval is used in each environment without requiring code changes.
