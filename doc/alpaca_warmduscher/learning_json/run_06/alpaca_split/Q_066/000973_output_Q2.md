Using an `Integer` to represent the number of probes has the potential for integer overflow. `Integer` has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. If the sample window captures data from more than this number of probes, the value will wrap around to a negative number, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially misleading results.

To address this, I would switch to using a `Long` data type instead.  `Long` has a much larger maximum value (9,223,372,036,854,775,807), significantly reducing the risk of overflow.

```java
Integer getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow(); //Existing method
Long getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow(); //New method
```

Like with the compressor state, maintaining backward compatibility is important. The existing method can remain while the new `Long` method is used for all new implementations.

Alternatively, if overflow is a significant concern and there is a reasonable upper bound on the expected number of probes, a `BigInteger` class could be used. However, `BigInteger` comes with a performance cost due to its arbitrary-precision nature. Using `Long` offers a good balance between range and performance for most scenarios.
