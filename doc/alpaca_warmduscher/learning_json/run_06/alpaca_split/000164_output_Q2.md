The last two routes in the `routes` array are crucial for handling edge cases and providing a smooth user experience in the application's routing.

* **`{path: '', redirectTo: 'dashboard', pathMatch: 'full'}`:** This route handles the case where the user navigates to the root of the application (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/`). It redirects the user to the `dashboard` route.  This is a common practice to provide a default landing page for the application. `pathMatch: 'full'` ensures that the redirect only happens when the path is *exactly* the empty string (`''`).

* **`{path: '**', redirectTo: 'dashboard', pathMatch: 'full'}`:**  This is a wildcard route. The `**` matches any path that hasn't been matched by any of the previous routes. It redirects the user to the `dashboard` route. This acts as a "catch-all" to prevent the user from seeing a "page not found" error if they enter an invalid or unknown route.  It ensures that the user is always directed to a valid page. `pathMatch: 'full'` means that any URL including any parameter will also redirect to dashboard.

In essence, these routes guarantee that the user always lands on a known and valid page (the `dashboard`) either when navigating to the root URL or when attempting to access an undefined route. This improves the robustness and user-friendliness of the application.
