For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts'... 
Assume the `AboutComponent` had a simple property called `appVersion` which is a string initialized in the constructor.  How would you modify the test suite to verify that the `appVersion` property is initialized with the expected value (e.g., "1.0.0")? Provide the relevant code snippet.
