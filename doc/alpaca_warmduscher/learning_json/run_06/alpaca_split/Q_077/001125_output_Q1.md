Several issues can arise from extreme input values:

*   **Overflow/Underflow:** The exponential term `Math.exp((17.67 * temperature) / (temperature + 243.5))` could result in values exceeding the maximum representable double value (overflow) for very high temperatures, or become so small as to be rounded to zero (underflow) for very low temperatures.
*   **Division by Zero:** While unlikely given the formula, if `(temperature + 243.5)` happened to be exactly zero (which would require a temperature of -243.5Â°C, approaching absolute zero, which is unrealistic), a division-by-zero error would occur.
*   **Invalid Input:**  Relative humidity should be between 0 and 1 (or 0% to 100%). Providing values outside this range would produce physically meaningless results, although it wouldn't cause a runtime error.

To address these issues:

*   **Input Validation:** Add checks at the beginning of the method to ensure that `temperature` and `relativeHumidity` are within reasonable bounds. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are not.
*   **Range Limiting:** Clamp the `temperature` and `relativeHumidity` values to prevent extreme values from causing issues.
*   **Handle Edge Cases:** Specifically check for temperatures approaching absolute zero and handle them appropriately (e.g., return a default value or throw an exception).
*   **Use Doubles Carefully:** Double-precision floating-point numbers have limitations. Be aware of their potential for rounding errors, especially when performing multiple calculations.
