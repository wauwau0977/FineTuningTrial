The `shareReplay(1)` operator transforms the `Observable` returned by `loader()` into a multicast observable. This means that instead of creating a new observable stream for each call to `get` with the same `cacheKey`, the `loader()` function is only executed *once*. The `shareReplay(1)` operator then replays the *last* emitted value (in this case, the entire observable stream) to all subsequent subscribers. 

This is crucial for the caching mechanism because it ensures that only one network request (or whatever the `loader()` function does) is made for a given `cacheKey`, regardless of how many components or services request the data. The result is then cached in `this.cache[cacheKey]` and replayed to all subsequent requests until the cache is evicted (via the `evict` flag) or the application is refreshed. The '1' argument means it replays the last one emission, effectively the entire observable stream.
