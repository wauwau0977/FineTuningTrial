The `@Cacheable` annotation is present, but seemingly unused because itâ€™s an interface.  Annotations on interfaces do not have direct runtime effects; they serve as metadata that can be picked up by implementations or aspects.  It likely indicates an intention to add caching functionality in the future, or it may have been part of a prior attempt that didn't fully materialize.

If the application required frequently accessing `SessionDevice` entities by their ID, enabling the cache would significantly improve performance.  To utilize it, a concrete implementation (e.g., using a Spring Cache abstraction with a provider like Redis or Ehcache) would be necessary. Then, the cache would store the results of calls to `findById()`, returning cached values for subsequent requests with the same ID, avoiding database hits. Configuring the cache eviction policy is also essential to prevent stale data.
