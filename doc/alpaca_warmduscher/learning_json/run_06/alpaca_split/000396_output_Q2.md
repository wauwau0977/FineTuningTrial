The `type: 'arearange'` configuration is used to create an area range chart. An area range chart displays the range between a minimum and maximum value for each data point.  It's essentially showing a band or range that represents the variability or spread of the data. The area between the minimum and maximum values is shaded, providing a visual representation of this range.

In this context, it's being used to visualize the temperature range for 'Sole Eintritt' (inlet temperature) and 'Sole Austritt' (outlet temperature). It implies that `this.soleInTempMinMax` and `this.soleOutTempMinMax` do *not* simply contain a single temperature value for each point in time, but rather a pair of values: a minimum temperature and a maximum temperature.

Specifically, the expected data structure for both `this.soleInTempMinMax` and `this.soleOutTempMinMax` would likely be an array of arrays (or a similar data structure) where each inner array contains two numeric values.  For example:

```typescript
// Example data
soleInTempMinMax: number[][] = [
  [1672531200000, 40, 45], // Timestamp, Min Temp, Max Temp
  [1672534800000, 42, 48],
  // ... more data points
];
```

Each data point would consist of a timestamp (representing the point in time) followed by the minimum and maximum temperature values for that timestamp. The chart then uses these three values to draw the shaded area representing the temperature range.  This is a good visualization for showing the variability or uncertainty around a temperature measurement, or simply the range within which the temperature fluctuated.
