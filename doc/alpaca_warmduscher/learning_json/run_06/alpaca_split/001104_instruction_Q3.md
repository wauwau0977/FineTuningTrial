For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/BeanUtils.java' with name 'BeanUtils.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
@Component
public class BeanUtils {
```
What does the `@Component` annotation signify in this context, and how does it relate to the overall architecture of the 'Warmduscher' project?
