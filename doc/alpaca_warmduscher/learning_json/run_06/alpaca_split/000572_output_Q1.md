Refactoring the `::ng-deep` selector requires a multi-pronged approach. First, I would investigate *why* it's being used. In this case, it's to override the margin-left of `.mat-card-header-text`. The ideal solution is to find a way to style the Material component itself *without* piercing encapsulation.

Here are the possible approaches, listed from most to least preferred:

1. **Theme Customization:** If the `mat-card` is part of a themed application, I would explore customizing the theme itself to override the default margin-left for *all* instances of the component. This is the cleanest solution but requires a global theme configuration.

2. **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** Define a CSS variable (e.g., `--th-card-header-margin`) within the application's base styles or a common theme file. The Material component could then access this variable to apply the desired margin.

3. **Component Communication (Input/Output):** If the card header is part of a reusable component, I would consider adding an `@Input` property to control the margin-left directly from the parent component. This provides more flexibility but increases coupling.

4. **Avoid the Override:** Determine if the current styling is truly necessary. Perhaps the default Material styling is acceptable, simplifying the component and reducing the need for overrides.

If none of these options are feasible, as a *last resort* and with clear documentation of the trade-offs, a component selector might be used instead of `::ng-deep`, but this still breaks encapsulation. I would document why this approach was chosen, and add a task to revisit this in the future. The goal is to eliminate the `::ng-deep` selector entirely.
