The purpose of these two `if` statements is to enforce mutually exclusive or mandatory parameters for the `getBetweenDates` method. They validate the input parameters `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows` to ensure the method is called with valid configurations.

*   **First `if` statement (`groupEveryNthSecond > 0 && maxRows > 0`)**: This checks if *both* `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows` are provided with positive values. If this condition is true, it means the caller has requested data to be limited by both a fixed time interval *and* a maximum number of rows, which is not supported by the implementation. The code throws a `ThException` to signal that these parameters are mutually exclusive â€“ the caller must choose one or the other, but not both.

*   **Second `if` statement (`groupEveryNthSecond < 0 && maxRows < 0`)**: This checks if *neither* `groupEveryNthSecond` nor `maxRows` are provided with positive values. It effectively checks if both parameters are missing or have invalid negative values. If this is true, it throws a `ThException` to indicate that at least one of the limiting criteria (either grouping by a time interval or limiting by the number of rows) *must* be provided.

**Why this validation is necessary:**

The subsequent code in the `getBetweenDates` method relies on these parameters to determine which database query to execute. The method has two distinct paths: one for grouping data by a fixed time interval (`groupEveryNthSecond > 0`) and another for limiting the results by the number of rows (`maxRows > 0`).  Without this validation, the code would proceed without knowing *how* to limit the data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

**What would happen if these checks were removed:**

If these checks were removed, the code might proceed based on the default values or fall through to an unintended code path. This could lead to several issues:

*   **Incorrect data retrieval:** The code might retrieve an unbounded amount of data (no `maxRows` limit) and then attempt to group it without a valid `groupEveryNthSecond` value, or vice versa.
*   **Database performance issues:** Retrieving an unbounded amount of data could overwhelm the database server, leading to slow response times or even crashes.
*   **Unexpected application behavior:** The application might return a large amount of data to the user, causing performance problems or rendering the user interface unresponsive.
*   **NullPointerExceptions or other runtime errors:** If the code expects a valid value for one of these parameters and it receives a null or invalid value, it could throw a runtime error.
