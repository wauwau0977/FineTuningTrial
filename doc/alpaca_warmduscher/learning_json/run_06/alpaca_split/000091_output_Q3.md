The `routes` constant, defined as an empty array (`[]`), represents the configuration for the application's routes. In this specific case, an empty array signifies that the application currently has no defined routes. This means that navigating to different URLs will not trigger any specific components or views.  

The implications are significant: the application will likely only display the default component defined in `app.component.ts` regardless of the URL entered in the browser. Any attempt to navigate to a specific route (e.g., `/some-path`) will likely result in a 404 error or simply render the default component, as no route is defined to handle it. To add navigation, routes need to be defined within this array, mapping URLs to specific components.  This indicates a very basic or incomplete application setup; likely, routes will be added later to implement more complex navigation.
