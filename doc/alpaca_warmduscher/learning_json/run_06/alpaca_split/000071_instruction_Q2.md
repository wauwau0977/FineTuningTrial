For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/test.ts' with name 'test.ts'... 
Explain the purpose of the `require.context('./', true, /\.spec\.ts$/)` line and how it interacts with the subsequent `context.keys().map(context)` line to discover and load test files. What potential issues might arise with this approach, particularly in larger projects?
