The 1-second interval, while aiming for responsiveness, introduces several potential drawbacks. Firstly, it creates a tight loop that constantly runs, even when unnecessary. This consumes CPU resources unnecessarily, impacting battery life on mobile devices and potentially slowing down the application. Secondly, it could lead to performance issues if the `myReload()` function itself is resource-intensive or if the network connection is slow. Finally, relying on a fixed interval doesn't account for varying network conditions or server response times.

Mitigation strategies include:

1.  **Debouncing/Throttling:** Implement debouncing or throttling on the interval's callback. This would limit the rate at which `myReload()` is called, even if the interval fires frequently.
2.  **Observables and Reactive Programming:**  Instead of a fixed interval, use an observable that emits a value only when certain conditions are met (e.g., a timeout since the last successful data fetch, or a state change indicating a need for refresh).  This is more efficient and flexible.
3.  **Conditional Refresh:**  Only initiate the refresh if the `lastServiceRefresh` is actually older than the desired interval. The current implementation always checks the condition within the interval.
4.  **Error Handling and Fallback:**  Include robust error handling within `myReload()` to prevent failures from disrupting the interval. Implement a fallback mechanism or exponential backoff if the service is temporarily unavailable.
5.  **Consider Web Workers:** For intensive processing within `myReload()`, move that logic to a web worker to avoid blocking the main thread.
