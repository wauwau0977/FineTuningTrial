The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation specifies the order in which the properties of the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface should be serialized when converting this object to JSON.  When a JSON serializer (like Jackson, which this annotation is associated with) encounters an object with this annotation, it will arrange the properties in the specified order within the resulting JSON string.  This ensures a consistent and predictable JSON output format, which can be beneficial for clients consuming the API, as they can rely on a specific property order.  Without this annotation, the order of properties in the JSON may vary depending on the serializer's implementation details, potentially causing compatibility issues or making it harder to parse.  It doesn’t affect the interface’s functionality itself, only the presentation of the data when serialized.
