SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor. This means the code written in `styles.sass` isn't directly interpreted by the browser. A SASS compiler will process this file and generate standard CSS files that the browser *can* understand. The generated CSS is typically linked to the HTML in the application.

The benefits of using SASS include:

*   **Nesting:** SASS allows you to nest CSS rules, mirroring the HTML structure. This makes styles more organized and easier to maintain.
*   **Variables:** Variables allow you to store values (like colors or font sizes) and reuse them throughout the stylesheet, promoting consistency and simplifying updates.
*   **Mixins:** Mixins allow you to define reusable blocks of CSS code.  This reduces redundancy and makes code more modular.
*   **Partials and Imports:**  SASS allows you to break down styles into smaller, manageable files (partials) and then import them into a main stylesheet, improving organization.
*   **Functions:** SASS supports functions which allow you to perform calculations and manipulations within your stylesheets.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** All these features combine to make SASS stylesheets generally easier to read, understand, and maintain compared to equivalent CSS code.
