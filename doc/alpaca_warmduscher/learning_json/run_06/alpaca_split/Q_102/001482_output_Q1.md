To extend this test class to verify an endpoint, you would need to use Spring Boot's testing support for web applications. Here's a breakdown of the steps and crucial annotations:

1. **Add `TestRestTemplate`:** Inject a `TestRestTemplate` into your test method. This is a convenient way to make HTTP requests to your application's endpoints during testing. You'll need to add the Spring Boot starter test dependency to your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

2. **Use `@LocalServerPort`:** This annotation allows you to dynamically determine the port on which your application is running during the test.  You'll need to use this to construct the correct URL for your endpoint.

3. **Make the HTTP Request:**  Use `TestRestTemplate` to send an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to the endpoint.

4. **Assert the Response:** Assert that the response status code, headers, and body are as expected.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.LocalServerPort;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ThserverApplicationTests {

    @LocalServerPort
    private int port;

    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate = new TestRestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void testEndpoint() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:" + port + "/your-endpoint", String.class);

        assertNotNull(response);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        // Add more assertions for the response body if needed.
    }
}
```

**Crucial Annotations:**

*   `@SpringBootTest`:  Starts the Spring Boot application context. `webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT` ensures that the application runs on a random port during the test, avoiding conflicts.
*   `@LocalServerPort`:  Injects the random port on which the application is running into the test class.
*   `@Autowired`: Can be used to inject other beans needed for the test.
