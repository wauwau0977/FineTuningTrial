For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java' with name 'InfoBean.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
public String getBuildVersionServer() {
    return buildVersionServer;
}
public void setBuildVersionServer(String buildVersionServer) {
    this.buildVersionServer = buildVersionServer;
}
```
These two methods demonstrate a common pattern in Java. Explain what this pattern is, and what is the purpose of having both a getter and setter method for the `buildVersionServer` field?
