For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpEntity.java'... 
Several fields (e.g., `ireg50CircTemp`, `ireg70TempCirc1`) have names suggesting they represent register values from a heat pump controller.  What potential challenges might arise from using these register names directly as field names, and how could a more descriptive naming scheme improve the code's readability and maintainability?
