The `encodeUnicodeStringToBase58String` and `decodeBase58ToUnicodeString` methods provide a convenient way to encode and decode Unicode strings using base58. Instead of directly handling byte arrays, they take Unicode strings as input and output, handling the necessary conversion to and from UTF-8 encoding internally.

The primary reason for these methods is to provide a more user-friendly API.  Developers often work with strings rather than raw byte arrays.  These methods encapsulate the details of converting between Unicode strings and byte arrays using `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`, which ensures consistent encoding and decoding of Unicode characters.

They also abstract away the encoding details from the core base58 encoding/decoding logic, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. This separation of concerns improves the overall design. Directly working with byte arrays would require the caller to explicitly handle Unicode encoding/decoding, which could lead to errors or inconsistencies.
