The primary issue is that `this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo()` returns an Observable, meaning `getServerInfo()` initiates an asynchronous operation. The `subscribe` method registers a callback to be executed when the Observable emits a value. However, the `return this.buildTimestampServer;` statement immediately *after* the `subscribe` call will execute *before* the asynchronous operation completes and updates `this.buildTimestampServer`. This will almost always result in the method returning an empty string, as `this.buildTimestampServer` will not yet have been populated by the response from the server.

To address this, the method should be refactored to handle the asynchronous nature of the Observable properly.  There are a few ways to do this:

1. **Return an Observable:** The simplest solution is to change the return type of the method to `Observable<string>` and return the Observable created by `this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo()`.  The calling component would then be responsible for subscribing to the Observable and handling the value.

   ```typescript
   getBuildTimestampServer(): Observable<string> {
     return this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo().pipe(
       map(info => info.buildTimestampServer)
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Use `async/await`:** Another approach is to make the method `async` and `await` the completion of the Observable:

   ```typescript
   async getBuildTimestampServer(): Promise<string> {
     const info = await this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo().toPromise();
     this.buildTimestampServer = info.buildTimestampServer;
     return this.buildTimestampServer;
   }
   ```
   This ensures that the method waits for the Observable to emit a value before returning the build timestamp.  Note the use of `.toPromise()` to convert the Observable to a Promise for use with `await`.

3. **Use a Subject/BehaviorSubject:** If multiple components need to react to the build timestamp, a `BehaviorSubject` could be used.  This would allow the `AboutComponent` to set the value, and other components to subscribe to it.  This approach introduces more complexity but can be useful for shared state.

The `@ts-ignore` comment is also a red flag. It indicates a potential type mismatch that should be investigated and addressed properly rather than suppressed.  The type of `info` should be defined to ensure proper type safety.
