The `emptyInstance()` method provides a way to create a default `MeteoSwissEntity` object with pre-defined values.  This is useful in scenarios where you need a valid instance of the entity, but the actual data is not yet available or relevant.

Here are two specific use cases:

1.  **Initialization of UI Elements:** When displaying a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects in a user interface, you might need to create a placeholder object before the actual data is loaded from the web service. This allows the UI to render correctly even if the data is still loading. For example, a grid component might require at least one row to be present to display the column headers. The `emptyInstance()` could serve as that initial row.

2.  **Default Value for Form Inputs:** In a form where users can edit `MeteoSwissEntity` data, you might use the `emptyInstance()` as the initial value for the form fields. This provides a clean slate for the user to start with and prevents the form from displaying potentially invalid or unexpected data.  If the form is used to *create* a new entity, the empty instance is a natural starting point.

In both cases, providing an `emptyInstance()` prevents null or undefined errors and makes the code more robust and predictable. It provides a defined state for the entity when real data is not immediately available.
