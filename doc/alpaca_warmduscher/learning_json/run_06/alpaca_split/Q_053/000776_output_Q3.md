The `sole_in_out_delta_in_operation_avg` calculates the average difference between `sole_in` (supply temperature) and `sole_out` (return temperature).  This value represents the temperature difference that the heat pump is achieving during operation.  

The overall goal of the query is to provide statistics about the heat pump's performance *while it's actively running*, excluding the initial startup phase.  The temperature difference is a key indicator of how efficiently the heat pump is transferring heat.  By focusing on periods where the compressor is running and has stabilized (indicated by the `di10compressor1` flag and filtering for minimum runtimes), the query aims to provide meaningful data for long-term analysis of heat pump performance and to avoid readings that are skewed by the system settling after being turned on.  The query aims to consolidate stats if a long-term analysis is conducted.
