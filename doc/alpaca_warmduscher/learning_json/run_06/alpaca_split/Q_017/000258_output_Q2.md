The potential issue with using the literal value `86400` directly in the comparison is a lack of clarity and maintainability. While it works for calculating seconds in a day, it's not self-documenting. Anyone reading the code needs to know that `86400` represents seconds in a day. If the definition of a day (e.g., accounting for leap seconds) ever changes, or if this value is needed elsewhere, it requires finding and updating every instance of the literal.

Here's how you could improve the code:

1.  **Use a Named Constant:** Define a named constant at the top of the file (or in a shared utility file) to represent the number of seconds in a day. This improves readability and maintainability.

    ```typescript
    const SECONDS_IN_DAY = 86400;

    // ... later in the function ...

    if (calculatedIntervalSeconds <= SECONDS_IN_DAY) {
        return "1d";
    }
    ```

2.  **Use a Date Object/Method (More Robust):** For even greater robustness, especially when dealing with date calculations, use JavaScript's `Date` object and its methods to calculate the number of seconds in a day.  This is more resilient to changes in the definition of a day and better handles edge cases (e.g., daylight savings time, leap years).

    ```typescript
    const secondsInDay = 24 * 60 * 60; // or, better:
    const secondsInDay = (new Date()).setHours(24, 0, 0, 0) / 1000;

    if (calculatedIntervalSeconds <= secondsInDay) {
        return "1d";
    }
    ```

By using a named constant or a date-based calculation, you make the code more readable, maintainable, and robust.  It also provides better documentation of the intent and reduces the risk of errors caused by hardcoded values.
