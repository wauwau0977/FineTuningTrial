For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
 constructor(
   public dayOfWeekStartingMonday: number,
   public dayOfWeekText: string,
   public sumBoilerDiffIncrease: number,
   public sumBoilerDiffDecrease: number,
   public numOfStatisticRecords1: number,
 ) {
 }
```
...What is the purpose of the `public` keyword used before each parameter in the constructor? Explain how this impacts the class and its instances.
