For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java'... The interface defines three static `execute` methods accepting different functional interfaces (Function, Callable, UnsafeRunnable).  What is the purpose of providing multiple overloads instead of a single, more generic method? What are the trade-offs of this approach?
