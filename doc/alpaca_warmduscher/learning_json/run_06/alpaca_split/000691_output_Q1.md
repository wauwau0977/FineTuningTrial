Logging the duration of `pollData()` provides a baseline for performance monitoring. In a production environment, this metric could be used to:

*   **Establish Performance Thresholds:** Define acceptable execution times. If the duration exceeds a threshold, it can trigger an alert indicating a potential performance issue (e.g., slow network connection, overloaded database).
*   **Identify Performance Degradation:** Track the average and maximum execution times over time. An increase in these metrics could indicate a performance trend that needs investigation.
*   **Capacity Planning:**  Analyze historical data to understand how execution time scales with data volume and identify potential bottlenecks that might require infrastructure upgrades.

Additional useful metrics to track include:

*   **Number of Records Polled:** Indicates the volume of data being processed.
*   **Number of Records Saved:**  Confirms successful data persistence.  A discrepancy between polled and saved records could indicate data errors or persistence issues.
*   **Error Count:** Tracks the number of exceptions encountered during the polling and persistence process.
*   **Data Source Availability:** Monitor the availability and response time of the MeteoSwiss data source.
*   **Queue Length (If Applicable):** If the data processing involves a queue, track the queue length to identify potential bottlenecks.
*   **CPU and Memory Usage:** Monitor the resource consumption of the `MeteoDataPoller` to identify potential resource leaks or optimization opportunities.

These metrics could be aggregated and visualized using monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to provide a comprehensive view of the component's health and performance. Automated alerts can then be configured to notify operators of any anomalies or potential issues.
