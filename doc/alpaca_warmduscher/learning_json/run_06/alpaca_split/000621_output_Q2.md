I would introduce a new property for the feature flag and conditionally assign the `serviceBaseURL` based on its value.

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  useStagingServer: false, // Feature flag
  serviceBaseURL: process.env.USE_STAGING_SERVER === 'true' ? process.env.STAGING_BASE_URL : ".",
  fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24,
  "buildTimestampClient": "v01-20220220-093352"
};
```

**Considerations regarding the build process:**

1.  **Environment Variables:** The `USE_STAGING_SERVER` flag should be controlled through an environment variable in the CI/CD pipeline.  This allows you to easily switch between production and staging environments without modifying the code. Also another environment variable `STAGING_BASE_URL` should be defined for staging url.
2.  **Build Time Replacement:** The CI/CD pipeline should ensure that the `USE_STAGING_SERVER` and `STAGING_BASE_URL` environment variables are set *before* the build process starts.
3.  **Conditional Configuration:** The build process should read the `USE_STAGING_SERVER` environment variable and use it to determine which `serviceBaseURL` to include in the built application.
4. **Testing:** Implement tests that verify the correct `serviceBaseURL` is being used in different environments (e.g., tests that check the API endpoints being called).
5.  **Security:** If the `STAGING_BASE_URL` is sensitive, make sure it's stored securely (e.g., in a secrets manager) and is not exposed in the codebase.

This approach provides a flexible and controlled way to switch between different API endpoints without requiring code changes. It is also easy to integrate into a CI/CD pipeline, allowing for automated deployment of different configurations to different environments.
