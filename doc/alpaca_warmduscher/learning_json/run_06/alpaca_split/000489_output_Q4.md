The `ofWebService` static method is responsible for creating a `HeatingEntity` instance from data received from a web service. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the mapping of data received via an external source (the web service) into an object of the `HeatingEntity` class.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Null Handling:** The method first checks if the input `data` is null. If it is, it calls the `this.emptyInstance()` method to return a default `HeatingEntity` instance with initial values. This provides a safe default in scenarios where no data is available from the web service.

2. **Data Mapping:** If the `data` is not null, the method proceeds to create a new `HeatingEntity` instance.  It extracts values from the `data` object and maps them to the corresponding properties of the new `HeatingEntity` instance. This includes:
   - `data.id` to `id`
   - `data.measurementDate` to `measurementDate` (after being transformed by `HeatingDataService.convertDate`)
   - `data.boilerTemp` to `boilerTemp`
   - `data.boilerTempMin` to `boilerTempMin`
   - And so on for all the properties of the `HeatingEntity` class.

3. **Date Transformation:** Notably, the `measurementDate` is passed through the `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` method before being assigned to the `measurementDate` property of the `HeatingEntity`. This suggests that the date format received from the web service may differ from the format expected by the `HeatingEntity`, and the `convertDate` function handles this transformation.

In essence, `ofWebService` acts as an adapter, taking web service data and converting it into a properly formatted and initialized `HeatingEntity` object. It ensures that even in the absence of data, a valid, albeit empty, instance is returned, preventing potential errors.
