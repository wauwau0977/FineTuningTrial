This design choice prioritizes simplicity and avoids the burden of forcing callers to handle checked exceptions. The benefit is cleaner code at the call site – callers aren't required to implement `try-catch` blocks or declare `throws` clauses, simplifying their logic. This is especially useful if the operations within `execute` are considered relatively low-level utilities where failures are likely programming errors that should halt execution.

However, the drawback is loss of granularity in error handling. By always re-throwing as `RuntimeException`, you lose the ability to handle different failure scenarios specifically. A caller can only catch all `RuntimeExceptions` from this utility, making it harder to recover gracefully or provide meaningful feedback to the user.  It also obscures the original exception type, hindering debugging. In a production system, more sophisticated error handling – perhaps wrapping the original exception in a custom exception type that provides more context – would be preferable, or using a logging framework to record the exception and then potentially re-throw a more appropriate exception.  The choice made is likely for rapid prototyping or internal tooling where simplicity is valued over robust error management.
