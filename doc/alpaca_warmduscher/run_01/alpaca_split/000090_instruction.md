You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This class, `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`, represents statistical data related to the difference between sole inflow and outflow during a heating operation. It stores data points such as average, minimum, and maximum delta values over a specific time window, along with compressor state and the number of probes used in the sample. The class provides methods for creating instances, including an empty instance and one populated from web service data.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**:
    - Data representation of sole inflow/outflow difference statistics.
    - Creation of empty instances for initialization.
    - Creation of instances from web service data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** Dates (`measurementDateStart`, `measurementDateEnd`), numerical values (`soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`, `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`), boolean (`compressorState`), and web service data (any).
    - **Outputs:** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` object.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - The constructor initializes the entity with provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()` returns a default entity with pre-defined values.
    - `ofWebService()` converts data received from a web service into an entity, handling null data by returning an empty instance.  It utilizes `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` to process date strings.
- **External Interactions**:
    -  Depends on `HeatingDataService` for date conversion.
    -  Assumes data comes from a web service, though it only processes the received data and doesn't directly interact with any API.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Handles null web service data by returning an empty instance, preventing potential errors.  If `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` fails, the application will likely crash. No explicit error handling is done for that conversion within this class.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The class instantiation and data access should be fast, as it represents simple data structures.
- **Maintainability**: The class is straightforward and well-defined, promoting easy maintainability and modification.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The class itself is reliable.  The reliability of the whole system depends on the `HeatingDataService` and the data source.
- **Usability**: The class is intended for internal use within the application and does not directly expose any external usability concerns.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `constructor()`: Initializes the entity with provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()`: Returns a default `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` instance.
    - `ofWebService()`: Creates an instance from web service data, handling null values.
- **Important Logic Flows**:
    - The `ofWebService` method handles the conversion of data from external source.
- **Error Handling**:
    - Handles null web service data.  Does not explicitly handle errors in the `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` call.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:  The class is a single module without dependencies on other classes (apart from `HeatingDataService`).

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: Objects, Dates, Numbers, Booleans.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None explicitly used within the class itself. The framework used is TypeScript

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`**:  Used for converting date strings received from the web service into Date objects.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**: The class is already lightweight. No significant performance improvements are expected.
- **Code Readability**:  The class is already easy to read.
- **Security Improvements**: No inherent security risks.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  The class is not a scalability bottleneck. Scalability is determined by the web service and the database.
- **Error Handling**: Add a try/catch block around the call to `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` in the `ofWebService()` method to handle potential parsing errors and provide a more robust solution. Consider logging these errors.
- **Type Safety**: While Typescript is used, ensure `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` is strongly typed to prevent invalid date formats from being passed.
