For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java'... 
In the `checkUnicodeToUTF` and `checkUnicodeToUTF2` methods, the test verifies that the encoded string does not contain certain characters (',', 'ï¿½', '\\', '"'). While this is a good start, what potential issues might arise from *only* checking for the absence of these specific characters? What additional validation would be necessary to ensure the correctness of the encoding and decoding process?
