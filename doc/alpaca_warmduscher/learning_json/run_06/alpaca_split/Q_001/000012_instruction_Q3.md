For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/index.html' with name 'index.html' where below a part of it is displayed...
```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="assets/icons/icon-192x192_non_transparent_dark.png">
<!-- for Apple iOS, must be non-transparent -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="assets/icons/icon-192x192_non_transparent_dark.png">
```
What is the purpose of these two lines of code, and why is it specifically mentioned that the `apple-touch-icon` must be non-transparent?
