I would treat caught `ThException` instances with a higher level of severity – likely an `ERROR` or even `CRITICAL` log level – and potentially trigger alerts. Because `ThException` represents programming errors or unrecoverable conditions, simply logging it as an `INFO` or `WARN` is insufficient. We need to be immediately notified of these occurrences.  Checked exceptions, on the other hand, are expected possibilities, so logging them at `WARN` or `INFO` is often sufficient.  Furthermore, logging for `ThException` might include more detailed diagnostic information, like stack traces and contextual data, to aid in debugging. For checked exceptions, we might focus on logging the recovery action taken. The goal is to treat unchecked exceptions as indicators of *problems needing immediate attention*, while checked exceptions represent *expected scenarios being handled*.
