The `timezoneOffset: new Date().getTimezoneOffset()` setting is crucial for ensuring that the charts display time-based data correctly, relative to the user's local time zone.

Highcharts, by default, uses UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for its time axis. If this setting wasn't applied, all timestamps on the charts would be displayed in UTC, which would be incorrect and confusing for users in different time zones.

`new Date().getTimezoneOffset()` returns the difference, in minutes, between UTC and the user's local time zone. By applying this offset to the chart's time axis, Highcharts automatically converts the timestamps to the user's local time, ensuring accurate and meaningful data visualization.  This is particularly important for an application displaying time-series data like temperatures and heating operation, where accurate time representation is critical for interpretation.
