The `ntile` function divides the rows of the query result into a specified number of groups (in this case, `:maxRows`).  Essentially, it assigns a group number to each row. In the context of this query, it's being used as a pre-grouping mechanism *before* the final aggregation.  The intention is likely to limit the number of rows considered in the subsequent `group by station_id`.

By applying `ntile`, the query aims to ensure that the final result set doesn't contain an unbounded number of entries per station.  Without `ntile`, the query might return a large number of statistics entries for each station if there are many measurements within the specified date range. `ntile` effectively samples the data before aggregation, which helps to control the size of the final result set.

The effect is that, for each station, the data is divided into `:maxRows` groups based on `temperature_measure_date`. The aggregation functions (avg, min, max) are then applied to each of these groups *for each station*, effectively summarizing the temperature and wind data within those groups. It's a form of bucketing or windowing the data.
