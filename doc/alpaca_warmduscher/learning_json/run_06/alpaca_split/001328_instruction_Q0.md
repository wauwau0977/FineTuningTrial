You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class, `MyRequestInterceptor`, functions as a Spring Web HandlerInterceptor to intercept incoming HTTP requests. It measures request processing time, extracts relevant request details (path, session ID, client ID, client version, IP address, HTTP status, exception details), and persists this information to a database (using the `SessionRequestRepository`). This data is used for monitoring, analytics, and debugging purposes. The interceptor also distinguishes between requests that should be logged and those that should not, based on a criteria defined in `MySessionFilter`.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MyRequestInterceptor`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Intercept incoming HTTP requests.
    - Measure the processing time of each request.
    - Extract request metadata.
    - Persist request metadata to a database.
    - Log request information and processing time.
    - Filter and differentiate between requests to be persisted or just logged.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, `Object handler` (from Spring Web MVC framework).  Request headers (`TH-KEY-CLIENT-ID`, `TH-KEY-CLIENT-VERSION`), Cookies, and `Exception` object are used internally.
    - **Outputs:**  Logs informational messages to the logger. Persists `SessionRequest` entities to the database.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  `preHandle()`: Records the start time of the request and stores it in the request attributes.
    2.  `afterCompletion()`:
        a. Retrieves the start time from the request attributes.
        b. Calculates the execution time.
        c. Extracts relevant request information (path, session ID, client ID, client version, IP address, HTTP status, exception details).
        d. Checks if the request should be persisted using `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)`.
        e. If the request is relevant:
            i. Creates a `SessionRequest` entity.
            ii. Populates the entity with the extracted information.
            iii. Saves the entity to the database using `SessionRequestRepository`.
            iv. Logs the request and processing time.
        f. If the request is not relevant:
            i. Logs a message indicating that the request was not persisted.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **Database:** Interacts with the database through `SessionRequestRepository` to save `SessionRequest` entities.
    - **Logging:** Utilizes SLF4J logger for logging informational messages and debugging information.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Exception Handling**: The `afterCompletion` method catches any `Exception` that occurred during request processing and saves the exception message in the `SessionRequest` entity.
    - **Missing Headers**: If `TH-KEY-CLIENT-ID` or `TH-KEY-CLIENT-VERSION` header are missing, the value will be null and saved to the database.
    - **Missing Cookie**: If `TH_SERVER_SESSON_ID` cookie is missing, sessionId defaults to “unknown”.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The interceptor should have minimal overhead to avoid significantly impacting request processing time. The database save operation should be efficient.
- **Scalability**: The database should be scalable to handle a large volume of `SessionRequest` entities.
- **Security**: The interceptor does not directly handle authentication or authorization.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively well-structured and documented.  Potential improvements could include more descriptive variable names.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The interceptor should be robust and handle unexpected errors gracefully. Database connectivity issues should be handled appropriately (e.g., with retries or fallback mechanisms).
- **Usability**: The interceptor integrates seamlessly with the Spring Web MVC framework.
- **Compliance**: The interceptor should comply with any relevant data privacy regulations.

## 5. Key Components

- **`preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)`:** Records the start time of the request.
- **`afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex)`:** Calculates processing time, extracts request details, saves request data to the database, and logs information.
- **`SessionRequest`**: A JPA entity representing a single request. Contains information such as path, session ID, client ID, client version, IP address, processing time, and HTTP status.
- **`SessionRequestRepository`**: A Spring Data JPA repository interface for interacting with the `SessionRequest` entity in the database.
- **Error Handling:** The `afterCompletion` method catches exceptions and saves the error message.
- **`MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)`**: Static method used to decide if a request should be saved in the database.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Java 8 or higher
- Data structures (Strings, Longs)
- Logging API (SLF4J)
- Servlet API (HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework:** Used for dependency injection, web request handling, and data access.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Used for simplifying database access.
- **SLF4J:**  Provides a simple facade for logging.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.SessionRequest`**: JPA entity representing the request data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.SessionRequestRepository`**:  Repository interface for interacting with `SessionRequest` entities.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Utils`**: Contains utility methods, including `getRequestIP()`.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.MySessionFilter`**: Contains the `isSessionRelevantRequest` method.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**:
    - Investigate the performance of the database save operation and optimize it if necessary. Consider using asynchronous saving to avoid blocking the request thread.
- **Code Readability**:
    - Add more descriptive variable names.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Consider sanitizing input data to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - Implement a caching mechanism to reduce database load.
    - Use a distributed database or message queue to handle a large volume of requests.
- **Configuration**:
    - Externalize configuration parameters (e.g. database credentials) for better maintainability and flexibility.
- **Error Handling**:
    - More detailed error logging and exception handling could be implemented. For example, logging stack traces for critical errors.
