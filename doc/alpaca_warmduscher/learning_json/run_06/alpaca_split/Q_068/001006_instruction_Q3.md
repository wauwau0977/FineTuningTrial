For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissEntity.java' with name 'MeteoSwissEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
private double sunshine;
private Date sunshineMeasureDate;
private double temperature;
private Date temperatureMeasureDate;
```
