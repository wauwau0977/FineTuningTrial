I would implement the validation logic within the constructor of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class. This ensures that any new instance created with an invalid `hourOfTheDay` value will be immediately flagged.

Here's how I would handle invalid values:

1.  **Throw an Error:**  The most robust approach is to throw an error. This will halt the creation of the instance and signal to the calling code that there's a problem.

    ```typescript
    constructor(
      hourOfTheDay: number,
      sumBoilerDiffIncrease: number,
      sumBoilerDiffDecrease: number,
      numOfStatisticRecords1: number
    ) {
      if (hourOfTheDay < 0 || hourOfTheDay > 23) {
        throw new Error("Invalid hourOfTheDay value. Must be between 0 and 23.");
      }
      this.hourOfTheDay = hourOfTheDay;
      this.sumBoilerDiffIncrease = sumBoilerDiffIncrease;
      this.sumBoilerDiffDecrease = sumBoilerDiffDecrease;
      this.numOfStatisticRecords1 = numOfStatisticRecords1;
    }
    ```

2.  **Log a Warning and Correct:**  Alternatively, you could log a warning message to the console and then "clamp" the value to the valid range (e.g., set it to 0 if it's negative, or to 23 if it's greater than 23).  This is less disruptive but could hide potential issues.

The choice depends on the specific requirements of the application. If it's critical that the `hourOfTheDay` value is always valid, throwing an error is the best approach. If it's acceptable to "fix" invalid values, logging a warning and correcting the value might be sufficient.
