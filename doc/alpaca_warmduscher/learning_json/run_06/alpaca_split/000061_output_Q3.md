This code snippet styles the container of Angular Material snack bar notifications.  It sets the `background-color` of the snack bar container to a light gray color defined by the `rgba(200,200,200)` value. This will make the snack bar notifications appear with a light gray background.

Using `rgba()` (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) instead of a hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#c8c8c8`) offers the benefit of transparency.  The 'a' value in `rgba()` controls the opacity of the color. In this case, since the alpha value is not explicitly set (implied to be 1), the color is fully opaque. However, using `rgba()` allows for easy creation of semi-transparent effects (e.g., `rgba(200,200,200,0.5)` for 50% opacity) without requiring complex CSS techniques. This can be useful for creating visually subtle notifications that don't obstruct the underlying content too much.
