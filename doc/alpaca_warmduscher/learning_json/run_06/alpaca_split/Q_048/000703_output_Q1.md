The `init()` method is crucial for setting up the data source used by this service. I would design it with the following considerations:

1. **Data Source Configuration:** The `init()` method would be responsible for establishing a connection to the MeteoSwiss data source. This could involve reading configuration properties (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs, database connection strings) from a configuration file or environment variables. Dependency Injection (DI) would be ideal for passing in pre-configured data source objects, improving testability and reducing hardcoding.

2. **Data Fetching/Loading:** Depending on the data source (API or database), `init()` would either fetch the initial dataset from the MeteoSwiss API or load data from the database.  For an API, Iâ€™d use a library like `HttpClient` or `RestTemplate` (Spring context) to make the initial request. If using a database, a JDBC connection and prepared statements would be necessary.

3. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is paramount. I'd wrap the data source connection and data loading logic in `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions like:
    *   `IOException`: Network errors, API unavailability.
    *   `SQLException`: Database connection errors, query errors.
    *   `IllegalArgumentException`/`IllegalStateException`: Invalid configuration.

    These exceptions should be logged with appropriate severity levels (WARN, ERROR) using a logging framework like SLF4J or Logback.  Depending on the severity, the `init()` method might throw a `RuntimeException` (e.g., `IllegalStateException`) to signal a critical failure that prevents the service from functioning, or it might attempt to recover (e.g., retry the API request a limited number of times).

4. **Data Validation:** After loading the data, I would perform basic validation to ensure data integrity. This could include checking for null values, data type correctness, and reasonable ranges.

5. **Caching (Optional):** If the MeteoSwiss data is relatively static or changes infrequently, consider implementing a caching mechanism (e.g., using a `HashMap` or a dedicated caching library like Caffeine or Redis) to store the loaded data and reduce the load on the external data source. The cache could be refreshed periodically or on demand.

6. **Resource Cleanup:** Ensure any resources acquired during initialization (e.g., database connections, HTTP clients) are properly closed in a `finally` block or using try-with-resources to prevent resource leaks.
