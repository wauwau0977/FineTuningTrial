Storing both individual measurements and min/max dates introduces potential complexity and redundancy. 

**Beneficial Use Case:** Imagine a reporting system that needs to display not only the current temperature but also the historical temperature range for a given day. Having the `temperatureMeasureDateMin` and `temperatureMeasureDateMax` allows for a quick retrieval of the earliest and latest temperature readings, without having to query and process a large dataset.  This optimizes performance for specific reporting requirements.

**Redundancy/Problematic Situation:** If the application only requires the latest temperature and wind speed, storing the min/max dates is unnecessary overhead. It increases database storage requirements and potentially complicates queries. Additionally, maintaining the accuracy of the min/max dates introduces complexity. If a new measurement is received that falls outside the current min/max range, all these fields need to be updated atomically to ensure data consistency. Without proper synchronization, there's a risk of inaccurate historical range data. Furthermore, if the application logic incorrectly updates the min/max values, it could lead to data corruption and misleading reports. This design suggests that the application might be intending to perform some sort of range-based analysis or tracking, but without further context, it's difficult to say if it's the most efficient approach.
