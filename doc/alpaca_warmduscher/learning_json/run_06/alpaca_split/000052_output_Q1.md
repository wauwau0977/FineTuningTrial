Styling components directly from a UI library like Material Design (likely Angular Material in this case) can be quick for simple customizations, but it's generally discouraged for larger projects. Here's a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

*   **Speed and Simplicity:** It's a fast way to make a visual change without having to delve into the library's configuration or theming system.
*   **Immediate Results:** Changes are immediately visible.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Specificity Issues:** Your styles might be overridden by the library's default styles or by other styles with higher specificity.  You might end up needing `!important` which is a code smell.
*   **Upgrade Difficulties:** When the library is upgraded, its internal structure or default styles might change, breaking your direct styling.  You'll need to re-apply your styles.
*   **Maintenance Overhead:**  As the application grows, managing direct styles across multiple components becomes cumbersome and error-prone.
*   **Theme Inconsistency:** It bypasses the intended theming system, making it difficult to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
*   **Loss of Theming Benefits:**  You lose the benefits of the library's theming features, such as dark mode support or easy color palette changes.

**Best Practice:**

The recommended approach is to use the UI library's theming or configuration options to customize the appearance of components. This ensures that your customizations are applied consistently, are less likely to be broken by upgrades, and leverage the full power of the library's theming capabilities.  For Angular Material, this means overriding variables in a theme file.
