Overriding both `equals()` and `hashCode()` is crucial when a class is intended to be used as a key in a `HashMap` or stored in a `HashSet`. These collections rely on the `hashCode()` method to determine the bucket in which to store the object, and on the `equals()` method to verify that a retrieved object matches the key used for insertion.

The contract they enforce is as follows:

1.  **If two objects are equal according to `equals(Object o)`, then their `hashCode()` values must be the same.**
2.  **If two objects have the same `hashCode()`, it does *not* necessarily mean they are equal according to `equals(Object o)`.** (Hash collisions are possible and acceptable, but they should be handled correctly).

If you violate the first rule (equal objects have different hash codes), the `HashMap` or `HashSet` will not be able to find the correct object, leading to unexpected behavior (e.g., data loss or incorrect retrieval). 

In this case, the `equals()` method only compares the `id` field.  Therefore, the `hashCode()` method should also only be based on the `id` to maintain consistency and ensure the contract is upheld.  If you only override `equals()` and not `hashCode()`, or if you override both incorrectly, the collections won't function as expected.
