Several approaches could improve resilience. One option is to use an options object in the constructor: `constructor(private options: { measurementDateStart?: Date, measurementDateEnd?: Date, ... })`. This allows you to add new data points without modifying the constructor signature. You'd access the data via `this.options.newAttribute`. Another approach, particularly useful if there are many optional fields, is to use a builder pattern, which allows for a more fluent and flexible way to create instances of the class. Finally, consider destructuring the options object to assign default values if a particular attribute is not provided. This minimizes the impact of changes to the data structure and makes the class more adaptable to future requirements.
