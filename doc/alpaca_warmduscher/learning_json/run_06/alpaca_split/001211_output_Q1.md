This class, `GlobalSynced`, provides a mechanism for safely operating on a shared resource (`syncedObject`) in a concurrent environment. Its primary purpose is to synchronize access to this shared resource, preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency.

The `ReentrantLock` is the core of the synchronization strategy. It ensures that only one thread can execute the `m.operateGlobalSynced(syncedObject)` block at any given time.  A thread attempting to execute the operation first attempts to acquire the lock using `reentrantLock.lock()`. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread will block until the lock is released.  The `finally` block *always* releases the lock with `reentrantLock.unlock()`, which is crucial to prevent deadlocks, even if an exception occurs within the `try` block.

The `MutexOperation` interface represents the actual operation to be performed on the `syncedObject`. The class delegates the operation to this interface through the `m.operateGlobalSynced(syncedObject)` call, but *always* does so while holding the lock.  This ensures that the operation is atomic with respect to other threads accessing the same `syncedObject`. The `Hooks` interface allows for before and after actions to be performed around the operation, potentially for logging, monitoring, or other cross-cutting concerns.
