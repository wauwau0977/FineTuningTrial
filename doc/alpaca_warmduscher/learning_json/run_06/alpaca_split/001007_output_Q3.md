The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are overridden to ensure proper object comparison and to enable the correct behavior of collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap`. These methods are essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency, particularly when working with database entities.

*   **`equals()`:**  This method determines if two objects are logically equivalent. In this case, two `MeteoSwissEntity` objects are considered equal if their `id` fields are equal. This is important for tasks like comparing entities retrieved from the database to ensure they represent the same record.
*   **`hashCode()`:** This method returns an integer value that uniquely identifies the object. It's crucial for hash-based collections (like `HashSet` or `HashMap`) to efficiently store and retrieve objects. The contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()` states that if two objects are equal according to `equals()`, they *must* return the same hash code.

The implementation is based on the `id` field because the `id` is assumed to be a unique identifier for each `MeteoSwissEntity`. Using a unique identifier ensures that objects representing the same entity are considered equal, even if other attributes differ.

**Implications of incorrect implementation:**

*   **Incorrect Comparisons:** If `equals()` were not overridden, the default implementation would compare object references (memory addresses). This would mean two `MeteoSwissEntity` objects with the same data but different references would be considered unequal.
*   **Hash Collision:** If `hashCode()` were not implemented correctly (or not consistent with `equals()`), objects that are equal according to `equals()` might have different hash codes. This would lead to incorrect behavior in hash-based collections, potentially causing data loss or retrieval errors.  Inconsistent hashcodes can degrade performance significantly in collections.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:**  If a different field were used for comparison (e.g., `temperature`), it could lead to treating distinct entities as the same, resulting in incorrect data updates or deletions.
