For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' we have the following question: 
The `getSignedNumber` method within the `HeatingModbusReadService` class (though the test is in `HeatingModbusReadServiceTest`) is designed to interpret an unsigned 16-bit integer as a signed 16-bit integer. Explain the logic behind this conversion, specifically detailing how values greater than 32767 are handled to represent negative numbers. Then, provide the complete implementation of the `getSignedNumber` method.
