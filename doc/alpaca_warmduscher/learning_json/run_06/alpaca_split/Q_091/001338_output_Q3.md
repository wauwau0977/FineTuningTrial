The `preHandle` method is part of the `HandlerInterceptor` interface and is executed *before* the actual controller method is invoked. Its purpose is to perform actions *before* request processing begins. In this specific implementation, it records the current time (in milliseconds) using `System.currentTimeMillis()` and stores it as an attribute on the `HttpServletRequest` object. The attribute name is `START_TIME_ATTR_NAME` (which is defined as "TH-START-TIME"). This start time will later be used in the `afterCompletion` method to calculate the total request processing time. Storing it as a request attribute allows it to persist through the request lifecycle.
