For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/HeatingDataReadService.java' with name 'HeatingDataReadService.java'...
The `getData()` method returns a `HeatPumpEntity`.  Assuming this entity contains potentially sensitive data (e.g., energy consumption, device status), what considerations should be made regarding data serialization and deserialization when passing this object between different application layers or services? Discuss potential vulnerabilities and how to address them.
