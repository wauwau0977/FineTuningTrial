If the `key` property (e.g., "1s", "5m", "1d") were used for comparison instead of `intervalInSeconds`, the sorting would be lexicographical (string-based) rather than numerical. This would lead to incorrect results. For example, "1d" would be considered "less than" "5m" because '1' comes before '5' in string order, even though a day is significantly longer than 5 minutes.

To address this, several options exist:

1.  **Parse the Key:** Within the `compare` method, parse the key string to extract the numerical value and unit (e.g., seconds, minutes, days). Then, convert everything to a common unit (e.g., seconds) before performing the comparison.
2.  **Introduce a Numerical Property:** Add a property to the `Interval` class that stores the interval length in a consistent unit (e.g., seconds). This property would be used for comparison. This is the most robust approach.
3.  **Custom Comparison Logic:** Implement a custom comparison function that handles different units correctly. This would be more complex than parsing the key or adding a numerical property.

The best approach would be to add a numerical property like `intervalInSeconds` to the `Interval` class to ensure a consistent and reliable comparison.
