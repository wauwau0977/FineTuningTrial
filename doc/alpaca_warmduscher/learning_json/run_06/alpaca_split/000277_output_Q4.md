The `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method determines the most appropriate interval to use for data collection, given a maximum number of data points, a start date, and an end date. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - `maxDataPoints`:  An integer representing the maximum number of data points to collect within the specified time range.
   - `start`: A `Date` object representing the beginning of the time range.
   - `end`: A `Date` object representing the end of the time range.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It retrieves a sorted array of predefined `Interval` objects using `UtilsServiceService.getStandardIntervals()`. This array represents the possible intervals that can be used.
   - It initializes `defaultInterval` to the first interval in the `intervals` array. This is the smallest interval and will be returned if certain conditions are met.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - It checks if `start` or `end` are null or undefined. If either is missing, it immediately returns the `defaultInterval`, indicating that no meaningful time range is provided.

4. **Time Range Calculation:**
   - It calculates the total time difference in seconds between the `end` and `start` dates using `Math.abs((end.getTime() - start.getTime()) / 1000)`.

5. **Desired Interval Calculation:**
   - It calculates the `desiredInterval` in seconds by dividing the `deltaInSeconds` by `maxDataPoints`. This represents the ideal interval length that would result in the specified number of data points.

6. **Interval Iteration and Matching:**
   - It iterates through the `intervals` array using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it compares the `interval.intervalInSeconcs` of the current interval with the `desiredInterval`.
   - If `interval.intervalInSeconcs` is *greater* than `desiredInterval`, it means this interval is the smallest one that can accommodate the desired data density (or is close enough). The method immediately returns this `interval`.

7. **Default Interval Return:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a matching interval (i.e., no interval is greater than the `desiredInterval`), it means the `desiredInterval` is smaller than all predefined intervals. In this case, the method returns the `defaultInterval` (the smallest predefined interval).  This ensures that an interval is always returned, even if the desired interval is very small.
