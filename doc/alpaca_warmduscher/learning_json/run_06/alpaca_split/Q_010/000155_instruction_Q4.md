For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.ts' with name 'app.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Explain the purpose of the constructor in the `AppComponent` class. What actions, if any, are performed within it, and how does this relate to the overall functionality of the component and the application?
