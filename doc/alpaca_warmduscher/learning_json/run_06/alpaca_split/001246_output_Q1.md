Several additions could enhance the interface. First, an `isLocked()` method would allow clients to check the mutex's state without attempting an operation. Second, a `lock()` and `unlock()` method pair would give clients more explicit control over the mutex, potentially allowing them to perform operations outside of the `operateGlobalSynced` method but still within the mutex's protection. A `tryLock(long timeout)` method would add non-blocking behavior.  

Furthermore, adding a `priority` field or an `OperationPriority` enum to the interface would allow different `MutexOperation` implementations to be prioritized if multiple operations are waiting for the mutex.  Finally, consider a `cancel()` or `interrupt()` method to allow ongoing operations to be cancelled if necessary. Depending on the application's needs, an asynchronous version of `operateGlobalSynced` using a `CompletableFuture` might also be beneficial.  These additions would transform the interface from a simple operation executor to a more comprehensive mutex management tool.
