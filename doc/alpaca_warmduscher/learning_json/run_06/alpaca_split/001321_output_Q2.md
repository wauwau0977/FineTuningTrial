The `SessionRequestRepository` is a dependency injected into the `MvcConfig` class via its constructor. This repository is presumably responsible for accessing and managing data related to session requests. In the context of this configuration, it's likely used by the `MyRequestInterceptor` (which is registered with the interceptor registry) to interact with the database, potentially to log requests, authorize access, or perform other request-related operations.  The interceptor uses the repository to access session request data.

Dependency injection significantly improves the testability of `MvcConfig`. By receiving the `SessionRequestRepository` through its constructor, we can easily mock or stub this dependency during unit testing.  Instead of relying on a real database connection and potentially impacting test performance and external system state, we can provide a mock implementation of the repository that returns predefined test data. This allows us to isolate the `MvcConfig` class and verify its behavior independently of the database. It makes tests faster, more predictable, and less prone to external dependencies.
