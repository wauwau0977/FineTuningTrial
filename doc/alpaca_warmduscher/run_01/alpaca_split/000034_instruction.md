You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface `Hooks<T>` defines a contract for objects that provide pre- and post-processing functionality for a generic type `T`. It allows for the execution of custom logic before and after an operation on an object of type `T`, enabling features like logging, validation, or state management. The interface throws `Throwable` to allow for handling of any exception that might occur within the hook methods.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java
- **Class Name(s):** `Hooks<T>`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Define the contract for objects that need to execute logic before and after an operation on an object of type `T`.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  The interface itself doesn't handle direct user input or output. However, implementations of the interface will receive an object of type `T` as input to the `before` and `after` methods.  The output is determined by the implementation of the `Hooks` interface, which might modify the input object or perform side effects.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. A client calls the `before(T t)` method on a `Hooks<T>` implementation.
    2. The `before` method executes custom logic.  Any `Throwable` thrown by this method is propagated.
    3.  The main operation on `T` is performed.
    4. The client calls the `after(T t)` method on the same `Hooks<T>` implementation.
    5. The `after` method executes custom logic. Any `Throwable` thrown by this method is propagated.
- **External Interactions**:  This interface has no direct external interactions (database, API calls, etc.). The specific implementations of the `Hooks` interface might have external interactions.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Exceptions in `before` or `after`**: The interface declares that the methods can throw `Throwable`, allowing calling code to handle any exception that occurs within the hooks.  This includes exceptions thrown by custom logic within the hook implementation.
    - **Null Input**:  Implementations should consider the possibility of receiving a `null` object as input, though this is not enforced by the interface itself.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The performance impact of implementing this interface will depend heavily on the complexity of the `before` and `after` methods. Implementations should be designed to minimize execution time.
- **Scalability**: The interface itself doesn't directly affect scalability.  However, if the `before` and `after` methods perform resource-intensive operations, this could impact scalability.
- **Security**: The interface itself doesn't introduce security concerns. However, implementations should ensure that any sensitive data handled within the `before` and `after` methods is properly protected.
- **Maintainability**: The interface is simple and well-defined, which contributes to maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The use of exceptions allows for robust error handling, contributing to reliability.
- **Usability**:  The interface is easy to understand and implement.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are applicable to this interface.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `before(T t)`:  Executes custom logic before an operation on an object of type `T`. Throws `Throwable` to allow error propagation.
    - `after(T t)`: Executes custom logic after an operation on an object of type `T`. Throws `Throwable` to allow error propagation.
- **Important logic flows**: The flow is simply calling either `before` or `after` depending on the event.
- **Error handling**:  `Throwable` is thrown to allow the calling code to handle any exception that occurs.
- **Classes**:  This is an interface, not a class. No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:  Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.mutex` module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Generic types (`<T>`)
- Interfaces
- Exception handling (`throws Throwable`)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None. This interface relies on core Java features only.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Specific Exception Types**:  Instead of throwing `Throwable`, consider defining more specific exception types to provide more granular error handling.  This would require modifications to the interface definition.
- **Context Object**:  Consider adding a context object to the `before` and `after` methods to provide additional information or access to shared resources. This could make the hooks more flexible and powerful.
- **Asynchronous Execution**:  If the `before` or `after` methods are potentially time-consuming, consider providing a mechanism for asynchronous execution to avoid blocking the main thread. This would require more complex implementation and error handling.
