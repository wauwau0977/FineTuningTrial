The `ofWebService` method serves as a factory method for creating a `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` instance from data received from a web service. It takes a generic `data` parameter, presumably a JSON object or similar structure representing the data from the web service. If the `data` is `null` or undefined (indicating no data was received), it returns a pre-defined "empty" instance using `this.emptyInstance()`. Otherwise, it extracts the relevant properties from the `data` object (`dayOfWeekStartingMonday`, `dayOfWeekText`, etc.) and uses them to construct and return a new `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` instance. This method provides a centralized and controlled way to map data from an external source to the class's properties, handling cases where the data might be missing or invalid. It encapsulates the data conversion logic and improves the robustness of the application.
