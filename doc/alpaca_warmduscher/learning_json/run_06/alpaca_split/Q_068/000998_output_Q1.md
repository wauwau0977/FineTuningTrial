`java.util.Date` is an older class with several known issues. It's mutable, which can lead to unexpected side effects if not carefully handled.  It also lacks clear support for timezones and doesn’t have a thread-safe design.  Furthermore, it's notoriously difficult to work with and can lead to confusing code.

A more modern and recommended alternative is `java.time` (introduced in Java 8). Specifically, `java.time.Instant` or `java.time.LocalDateTime` would be more suitable.

*   `java.time.Instant`: Represents a specific point in time with nanosecond precision. It’s immutable and well-suited for storing timestamps in a consistent and reliable manner.
*   `java.time.LocalDateTime`: Represents a date and time without a timezone. If timezone information is crucial, use `java.time.ZonedDateTime`.

Using `java.time` offers several advantages:

*   **Immutability:** Ensures data integrity and avoids unexpected side effects.
*   **Clear Timezone Support:**  Makes handling timezones much easier and more reliable.
*   **Thread Safety:**  Designed to be thread-safe, simplifying concurrent access.
*   **Improved API:**  Provides a cleaner and more intuitive API for date and time manipulation.
