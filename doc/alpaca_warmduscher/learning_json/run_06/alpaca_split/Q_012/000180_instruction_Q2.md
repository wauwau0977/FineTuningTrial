For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.spec.ts' with name 'client-id.service.spec.ts'... 
Assume the `ClientIdService` is intended to generate a unique client ID for each *application session* (e.g., when the user first opens the app). Given this context, how would you modify or extend the provided test suite to better verify this behavior?
