The current implementation of `getCurrent()` is not thread-safe. Multiple threads calling `getCurrent()` simultaneously will each create their own `MemoryInfo` object with potentially different values obtained from `Runtime.getRuntime()`. This could lead to inconsistent data being reported to different parts of the application.

Performance-wise, creating a new object each time, even if small, incurs overhead. While likely not a major bottleneck in most scenarios, repeated calls could add up.

To improve this, you could make `getCurrent()` a static method that returns a *singleton* instance of `MemoryInfo`. The singleton could be lazily initialized (initialized only on first access) to minimize startup overhead. Synchronization (e.g., using `synchronized` or a double-checked locking pattern, though the latter is tricky) would be needed to ensure thread-safe initialization of the singleton. Alternatively, you could cache the `MemoryInfo` object for a short period, regularly refreshing it in a background thread.
