For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java' with name 'Hooks.java' we have the following question: 
Explain how this `Hooks` interface facilitates loose coupling and testability within a system employing a mutex. Describe a scenario where you would use a mock implementation of this interface during unit testing of a mutex class that *uses* this interface. Provide a code snippet demonstrating how you would create and use such a mock.
