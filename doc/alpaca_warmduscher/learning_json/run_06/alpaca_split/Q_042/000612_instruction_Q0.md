You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines the production environment configuration for the 'Warmduscher' project's client-side application. It provides essential settings such as the base URL for the service, the interval for full page refreshes, and a build timestamp for versioning. This file is used to configure the client application when deployed in a production environment.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** None. This is a TypeScript file containing a constant object, not a class definition.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Defines environment-specific configuration settings for the 'Warmduscher' client application.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This file has no direct user inputs. It's read by the application during startup. The output is a JavaScript object containing the configuration settings.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The file directly exports a constant object.  The application reads the properties of this object.
- **External Interactions**: None. The file itself doesn't perform external interactions. It provides data *to* the application.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: No specific edge case handling. Incorrect values will likely lead to application errors, but the file itself does not contain any error handling logic.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Negligible. The file is small and loaded during application startup. Impact on performance is minimal.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable. This file doesn't directly impact scalability.
- **Security**:  The `serviceBaseURL` should be carefully managed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Maintainability**: The configuration is straightforward and easy to modify.
- **Reliability & Availability**: High. The file is static and should be reliably available.
- **Usability**: Easy to understand and modify for configuration purposes.
- **Compliance**:  Potentially relevant if the `serviceBaseURL` needs to comply with data privacy regulations.

## 5. Key Components

- **`environment` object**: A JavaScript object containing the configuration settings.
    - `production`: Boolean indicating whether the environment is production. Set to `true`.
    - `serviceBaseURL`: String representing the base URL for the backend service.
    - `fullPageRefreshInSeconds`: Number representing the interval (in seconds) for full page refreshes.
    - `buildTimestampClient`: String containing the build timestamp.
- **No functions or classes**: This is a simple configuration file.
- **Error handling**: None.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Object literals
- String and number data types
- Boolean data type

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- TypeScript: This file is written in TypeScript, and is dependent on the TypeScript compiler for compilation.
- None otherwise.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None. This file is self-contained.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Configuration Management:** Consider using a more robust configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, a configuration server) to separate configuration from code and enable dynamic configuration updates.
- **Centralized Configuration:** If other environments exist (development, staging), consider centralizing all environment configurations in a single location for better maintainability.
- **Validation:** Add validation to the configuration values to ensure they are valid (e.g., `serviceBaseURL` is a valid URL).
- **Security Hardening:** Evaluate the possibility of dynamically setting the `serviceBaseURL` at runtime to prevent hardcoding sensitive information.
