Using a range check with `assertTrue` has some advantages and disadvantages compared to using `assertEquals` with a delta (tolerance).

**Advantages of Range Check:**

*   **Readability:** It's quite easy to understand the intent â€“ the value must fall within a certain range.
*   **Simplicity:**  It's a straightforward implementation.

**Disadvantages of Range Check:**

*   **Less Precise:** It provides only a rough verification. The accepted range might be unnecessarily wide, potentially masking minor inaccuracies in the calculation.
*   **Difficult to Maintain:** If the expected value changes slightly due to updates in the underlying physics formula, the entire range might need to be adjusted.
*   **Lack of Specific Error Information:**  If the assertion fails, it only indicates that the value is outside the range, not how far off it is.

**Advantages of `assertEquals` with Delta:**

*   **Precision:** It allows for a more precise comparison, accommodating small floating-point errors or inherent imprecision in the calculation.
*   **Maintainability:** Adjusting the delta allows for controlled tolerance without needing to recalculate entirely new ranges.
*   **Detailed Error Reporting:**  If the assertion fails, it reports the difference between the expected and actual values, providing more helpful debugging information.

In general, using `assertEquals` with a delta is a more robust and maintainable approach for testing floating-point calculations, especially in scientific or engineering contexts.
