You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the functionality and technical aspects of a Sass stylesheet (`overview-current.component.sass`) used within the 'Warmduscher' project. This stylesheet primarily focuses on visual adjustments to Angular Material components used in the `overview-current` component, specifically addressing margin and spacing issues to achieve a desired layout. It attempts to override default Angular Material styles, using the deprecated `::ng-deep` selector, suggesting a potential CSS encapsulation issue.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass`
- **Class Name(s):**  `.myHeader`, `.textBig`, `.boilerTemp`, `.spacer` (These are CSS classes, not programming class names).

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: This file defines visual styles for specific elements within the `overview-current` component, altering their appearance.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: No direct user input or output. Styles are applied based on the component’s state.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The stylesheet applies CSS rules to modify margins and spacing of selected elements.
- **External Interactions**: No external interactions beyond rendering in the browser.  Relies on Angular Material components being present in the DOM.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: No explicit error handling within the stylesheet itself. Incorrect styling might lead to layout issues, but this is a visual concern, not a functional error.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal impact on performance, as it’s a small stylesheet.
- **Scalability**: Scalability isn’t a primary concern for this file.
- **Security**: No security implications.
- **Maintainability**: The use of `::ng-deep` makes maintenance harder, as it bypasses style encapsulation. Future Angular updates might break this styling.
- **Reliability & Availability**: No direct impact on system reliability.
- **Usability**: Affects visual usability by controlling layout and spacing.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`.myHeader`**:  Targets a header element, attempting to remove margin-left from the text within the card header.
- **`.textBig`**: Adds a small bottom margin to elements with this class.
- **`.boilerTemp`**: Adds a left margin to elements with this class, likely used for displaying temperature readings.
- **`.spacer`**:  Adds a bottom margin, presumably to create visual spacing.
- **`::ng-deep`**: A CSS selector used to penetrate component style encapsulation.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- CSS syntax
- Sass syntax (variables, nesting, etc.)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular Material**:  Relies on Angular Material components being present and styled by their default rules.
- **Sass**: The stylesheet is written in Sass, requiring a Sass compiler.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None explicitly listed. This file likely depends on the `overview-current` component’s template and any associated data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Not applicable. The file is small.
- **Code Readability:** The code is fairly readable due to its simplicity.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Not directly applicable.
- **Replace `::ng-deep`:** The most significant improvement is to remove the use of `::ng-deep`. This can be achieved by:
    - **Component Styling:** Moving the styling directly into the component’s stylesheet, utilizing Angular’s view encapsulation.
    - **CSS Variables:** Using CSS variables to customize Angular Material themes.
    - **Shadow DOM:** Investigating the use of Shadow DOM for true style encapsulation (though this might introduce compatibility issues).
- **Modularization:** If more complex styling is required, consider breaking the styling into smaller, more manageable Sass files.
