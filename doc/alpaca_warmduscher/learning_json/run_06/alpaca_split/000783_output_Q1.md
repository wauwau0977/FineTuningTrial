Exception handling in the repository layer is crucial for application stability and maintainability. My exception handling strategy would be based on these principles:

1.  **Don't Catch Generic `Exception`:** Avoid catching the broad `Exception` class. It hides potential problems and makes debugging difficult.  Catch specific exceptions like `DataAccessException` (from Spring) or relevant database exceptions (e.g., `SQLException`).

2.  **Translate Database Exceptions:**  Database-specific exceptions (like `SQLException`) should be translated into more application-specific exceptions (e.g., `DataNotFoundException`, `InvalidDataException`, `DatabaseConnectionException`).  This prevents exposing database internals to the upper layers and allows for consistent error handling.

3.  **Repository Layer Should Not Handle Business Logic:** The repository layer should *not* attempt to handle business logic within its exception handling.  If an exception requires business-specific decision-making (e.g., retrying an operation, logging a specific error message), that logic should be handled by the service layer.  The repository should simply propagate the exception or translate it to a generic application exception.

4.  **Retry Mechanisms (where appropriate):** For transient errors (e.g., temporary network issues, database connection problems), implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.  Spring Retry provides a convenient way to do this.

5.  **Logging:**  Log all exceptions with sufficient detail to diagnose the problem (e.g., stack trace, query parameters, user ID).  Use a logging framework like SLF4J.

6.  **Centralized Exception Handling (Optional):** Consider using a centralized exception handling mechanism (e.g., a global exception handler in Spring) to handle common exceptions and provide consistent error responses to the client.

Specifically, in this repository, I'd likely:

*   Catch `DataAccessException` (or equivalent).
*   Translate specific `SQLException`s to custom application exceptions.
*   Log the exception details.
*   Re-throw the translated exception (or a generic application exception) for the service layer to handle.
*   Implement retry logic for transient database errors.
