For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/audit/AuditLogRepository.java' with name 'AuditLogRepository.java' we have the following question: 
Assume we want to add a method to this repository to find all audit logs created after a specific date.  Describe the signature of the method, including its return type, name, parameters, and any relevant annotations. Then briefly explain how Spring Data JPA would use this method definition to implement the actual database query.
