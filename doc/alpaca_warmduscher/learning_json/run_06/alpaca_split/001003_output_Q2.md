Timezone handling is critical when working with dates in reporting and analytics, especially when the application or data source spans multiple geographic regions. Here's what needs to be considered:

1.  **Storage in UTC:** The best practice is to *always* store date/time values in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in the database. This avoids ambiguity and simplifies calculations.  Before persisting a `Date` object, it should be converted to UTC.

2.  **Consistency:** Ensure *all* `Date` fields are handled consistently â€“ that is, all are converted to UTC before persistence.

3.  **Retrieval and Presentation:**  When retrieving dates for reporting or presentation, convert them from UTC to the appropriate timezone based on the user's locale or the reporting requirements.

4.  **Avoid `java.util.Date`'s Timezone Issues:** `java.util.Date` is somewhat problematic for timezone handling. Consider using `java.time` (introduced in Java 8) which provides a much more robust and user-friendly API for handling dates and times, including explicit timezone support.

5. **Data Source Timezone:** Verify the timezone of the data source providing the input for these entities. If the source is not in UTC, appropriate conversion is needed before persisting to the database.

In this specific class, you'd need to ensure that *before* persisting an instance, all `Date` fields are converted to UTC, and when reading them for reporting, they are converted to the correct timezone.
