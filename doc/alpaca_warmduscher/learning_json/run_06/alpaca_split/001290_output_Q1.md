Adding CORS headers to *every* request, even those from the same origin, introduces a small performance overhead. While the overhead of adding a few headers is minimal, it's still unnecessary work for requests that donâ€™t require CORS handling. Over many requests, this cumulative overhead could become noticeable.

A more efficient approach would be to conditionally apply the CORS headers only to requests that appear to be cross-origin. This could be done by checking the `Origin` request header. If the `Origin` header is present and does *not* match the server's origin, then the CORS headers should be added. If the `Origin` header is absent or matches, the headers can be skipped.

Alternatively, the filter could be configured to be mapped to specific URL patterns. This way, CORS filtering would only be applied to certain parts of the application that require it, reducing the overhead for other requests. Frameworks like Spring offer flexible filter mapping capabilities. Also, if the application is solely serving a static frontend from the same origin, the CORS filter could be disabled or removed entirely.
