The `scanAllRegisters` method is designed to retrieve data from a heat pump by scanning a specified number of registers. 

**Purpose:** The method's primary function is to read data from the heat pump's registers, likely to populate or update the `HeatPumpEntity`. It acts as a low-level data acquisition step.

**Input Parameters:**
*   `int maxRegister`: This integer parameter defines the upper limit of registers to scan. It indicates the number of registers the method should attempt to read data from, starting from a default or configured starting register (which isnâ€™t explicitly defined in the interface, implying an internal implementation detail).

**Return Value:**
*   `List<String>`: The method returns a `List` of `String` objects. Each string presumably represents the raw data read from a single register. The exact format of the strings (e.g., hexadecimal, decimal, text) isn't defined in the interface, but it would depend on the specific heat pump's communication protocol.

**Potential Exceptions:** 

While the interface doesn't explicitly declare checked exceptions, the method could throw various exceptions during the process, including:

*   `Exception` (generic): A broad exception indicating issues with communication or data parsing.
*   `IOException`: If there are problems with the communication channel to the heat pump.
*   `IllegalArgumentException`: If `maxRegister` is invalid (e.g., negative).
*   `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: If an attempt is made to read beyond the valid range of registers.
*   Any exceptions specific to the underlying communication protocol or device.

The method is likely responsible for handling the low-level communication and potentially parsing the data received from each register. It assumes the existence of an underlying mechanism for communicating with the heat pump and reading register values.
