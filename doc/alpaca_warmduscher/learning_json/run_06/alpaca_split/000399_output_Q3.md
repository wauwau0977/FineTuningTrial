The `zIndex` property within the series configuration for the 'SoleTemp' chart controls the layering order of the series.  A higher `zIndex` value means the series will be drawn on top of series with lower `zIndex` values.

In this specific case, 'Sole Eintritt' is assigned a `zIndex` of 0, while 'Sole Austritt' is assigned a `zIndex` of 1. This ensures that the 'Sole Austritt' series (the outgoing sole temperature) is visually rendered *on top of* the 'Sole Eintritt' series (the incoming sole temperature).  This layering can be important when areas overlap to visually prioritize one series over the other, making it more easily visible. Without explicitly setting the zIndex, the rendering order might be unpredictable, or the series might visually overlap in an undesirable way.
