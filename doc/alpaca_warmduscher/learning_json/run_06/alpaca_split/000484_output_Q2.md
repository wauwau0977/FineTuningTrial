Let's analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach for creating an "empty" `HeatingEntity` instance:

**1. Static Method (`emptyInstance()` - current implementation)**

* **Advantages:**
    * **Convenience:** Easy to call without needing an instance of the class (e.g., `HeatingEntity.emptyInstance()`).
    * **Clear Intent:** Explicitly indicates that this method creates a special, pre-defined instance.
    * **Global Access:** Provides a single, central point for creating empty instances.

* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Tight Coupling:** The class is now responsible for knowing how to create an "empty" instance, which might be considered a responsibility outside its core domain. This can make it harder to change the logic for creating an empty instance without modifying the class itself.
    * **Less Flexibility:**  If the definition of an "empty" instance changes significantly in the future, it requires modifying the static method.

**2. Non-Static Method (Instance Method)**

* **Advantages:**
    * **Flexibility:**  Allows for more complex initialization logic based on the instance itself (though unlikely in this specific case).
    * **Encapsulation:**  The logic for creating an "empty" instance is encapsulated within the class, potentially promoting better organization.

* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Requires an Existing Instance:** You need an instance of `HeatingEntity` to call the method, which is counterintuitive for creating an "empty" instance.
    * **Less Clear Intent:** It's less obvious that this method is specifically for creating an empty instance.

**3. Constructor Overload**

* **Advantages:**
    * **Cleanest Approach:**  Provides a natural way to create an "empty" instance directly through the constructor.
    * **Reduced Complexity:** Avoids the need for a separate method or static function.
    * **Type Safety:** Enforces type checking during instantiation.

* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Can Clutter Constructor:** If you have many constructor overloads, it can make the constructor signature harder to read.
    * **Might Not Be Clear:** It's not immediately obvious that a particular constructor overload is meant for creating an empty instance.  Good documentation or a specific naming convention (e.g., `HeatingEntity.createEmpty()`) would be needed.

**Recommendation:**

For this specific scenario, **a constructor overload is the most suitable approach**. It's the cleanest and most natural way to create an empty instance.

**Example:**

```typescript
export class HeatingEntity {
  constructor(
    id: string | null,
    measurementDate: Date,
    boilerTemp: number,
    // ... other properties
  ) {
    // ... initialization logic
  }

  constructor() {
    this(null, new Date(), 0, /* default values for other properties */);
  }
  // ... other methods
}
```

While the static method is currently functional, the constructor overload offers better encapsulation, flexibility, and clarity.  It aligns better with the principles of object-oriented design and simplifies the creation of empty instances.
