The primary issue is that `data.measurementDateStart` and `data.measurementDateEnd` could be in an unexpected format or be invalid dates altogether. If the web service returns a date string that `HeatingDataService.convertDate` can't parse, the `convertDate` function might return `null` or throw an error, potentially crashing the application or resulting in incorrect data.  A more subtle issue is that even if the parsing *succeeds*, the web service might be using a different timezone than the application expects, leading to misinterpretations of the date and time.

Scenario: The web service returns `measurementDateStart` as a string formatted as 'MM/DD/YYYY' (e.g., '12/31/2023'). `HeatingDataService.convertDate` expects 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Without proper handling, the conversion might fail or, worse, produce a date thatâ€™s completely wrong.

Mitigation: Before passing the data to `HeatingDataService.convertDate`, add a validation step to check if `data.measurementDateStart` and `data.measurementDateEnd` are valid strings or dates. If they are strings, attempt to parse them using a standardized date parsing method *before* calling `convertDate`. If parsing fails, you could log an error, use a default date, or return the `emptyInstance()`.  Within the `convertDate` function itself, explicit error handling (try-catch blocks) is crucial to gracefully handle invalid date strings. The best approach would be to explicitly define the expected date format within the `convertDate` function and use that format when parsing the input.
