For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java'... The name 'Unsafe' is quite provocative. What potential concerns might arise from using such a name for an interface, and what justifications might there be for choosing it despite those concerns?
