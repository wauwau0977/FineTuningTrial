`TestBed.inject(ClientIdService)` is crucial for obtaining an instance of the `ClientIdService` within the Angular testing environment. It leverages the dependency injection system configured by `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})`.  Instead of directly creating an instance with `new ClientIdService()`, `TestBed.inject()` ensures that the service is created within the context of the test module, allowing Angular's dependency injection mechanism to provide any required dependencies or overrides.

Here's how it differs from `new ClientIdService()`:

*   **Dependency Injection:**  If `ClientIdService` depends on other services, `TestBed.inject()` ensures those dependencies are properly injected (potentially as mocks or stubs) as configured in the test module.  Using `new ClientIdService()` would require manual creation and injection of these dependencies, which is cumbersome and error-prone.
*   **Overriding Dependencies:**  The test module allows you to override dependencies for testing purposes. `TestBed.inject()` respects these overrides, allowing you to control the behavior of dependencies during the test.
*   **Angular Context:** `TestBed.inject()` creates the service within the Angular context, ensuring that any Angular-specific features or lifecycle hooks are correctly initialized and managed.
*   **Test Isolation:**  By using `TestBed.inject()`, you're ensuring that the service being tested is isolated from the main application's environment, which promotes test stability and reliability.

In essence, `TestBed.inject()` facilitates a more robust and controlled testing environment for Angular components and services by leveraging the power of dependency injection. Using `new ClientIdService()` bypasses this mechanism, making the test less reliable and potentially harder to maintain.
