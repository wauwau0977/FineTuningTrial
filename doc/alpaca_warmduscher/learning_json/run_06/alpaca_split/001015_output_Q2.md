The purpose of using `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` is to generate a globally unique identifier for each `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` instance.  UUIDs ensure that even if multiple data sources or services attempt to create entities with the same identifiers, collisions are extremely unlikely.

**Benefits of using UUID compared to auto-incrementing integers:**

*   **Scalability & Distributed Systems:** UUIDs are crucial in distributed systems where multiple servers might be generating new records simultaneously. Auto-incrementing integers require centralized coordination (e.g., a database sequence) to avoid collisions, introducing a potential bottleneck.
*   **Data Integration:** UUIDs facilitate data integration from different sources. If data from multiple origins is combined, UUIDs prevent key collisions and allow for seamless merging.
*   **Security:** While not a primary security feature, UUIDs can make it slightly more difficult for attackers to predict primary key values, reducing the risk of targeted attacks.

**Drawbacks of using UUID compared to auto-incrementing integers:**

*   **Storage Space:** UUIDs are typically 36 characters long, requiring more storage space than an integer.
*   **Performance:** UUIDs can impact database performance, particularly for indexing and clustering. Integer keys are generally more efficient for these operations. UUIDs are random and can lead to page fragmentation within database indexes, which decreases query speed.
*   **Index Size:** The larger size of UUIDs leads to larger index sizes, which can increase memory usage and slow down query performance.

The use of `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` suggests an attempt to mitigate the storage size drawback of standard UUIDs, potentially by generating a shorter, though still globally unique, identifier.
