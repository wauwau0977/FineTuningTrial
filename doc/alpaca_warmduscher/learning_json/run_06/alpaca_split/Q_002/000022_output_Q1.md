If the `.catch()` block was removed, any errors that occur during the bootstrapping process of the Angular application would be unhandled. This means the application might fail to start silently, leaving the user with a blank page or a non-functional application without any clear indication of what went wrong. 

The bootstrapping process involves several steps, such as loading modules, creating components, and resolving dependencies. Any of these steps can potentially fail due to network issues, configuration errors, or other problems. The `.catch()` block provides a safety net by catching these errors and logging them to the console, which is essential for debugging and identifying the root cause of the problem. Without it, debugging becomes significantly more difficult, and troubleshooting requires more complex techniques like browser developer tools and network analysis.  It's a best practice to *always* include error handling in bootstrapping to ensure a more robust and maintainable application.
