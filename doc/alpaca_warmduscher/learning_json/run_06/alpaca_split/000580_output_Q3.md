The `.boilerTemp` class is intended to add a left margin of 10 pixels to elements it's applied to. Given the class name, it likely styles a temperature display related to a boiler within the application.

The use of *only* `margin-left` suggests the intention is to horizontally offset the temperature display from its preceding element, potentially aligning it to the right or creating a specific visual relationship. By only modifying the left margin, the class doesn't affect the vertical positioning or other margins, offering precise horizontal control over the elementâ€™s placement within its container. It implies the vertical spacing is handled by other styles or the container itself.
