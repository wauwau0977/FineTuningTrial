You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
The `GlobalSynced` class provides a mechanism for synchronized access to a shared object (`T`). It uses a `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can operate on the object at a time. It also allows for optional "before" and "after" hooks to be executed around the operation on the synchronized object, enabling pre and post-processing logic. It's designed to encapsulate critical sections that require mutual exclusion, particularly useful for managing concurrent access to shared resources within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java
- **Class Name(s):** `GlobalSynced`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Synchronized access to a generic object (`T`).  Executes a provided operation (`MutexOperation`) on the object while holding a lock.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** An instance of `MutexOperation<T>` which encapsulates the logic to be performed on the synchronized object.
    - **Output:**  None directly. The operation modifies the synchronized object (`T`) in place.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. A `MutexOperation` is passed to the `requestOperation` method.
    2. The `ReentrantLock` is acquired.
    3. If a `Hooks` instance is provided, the `before()` method is called on it with the synchronized object.
    4. The `operateGlobalSynced()` method of the provided `MutexOperation` is called, with the synchronized object as an argument.
    5. A `try-catch-finally` block ensures that the `after()` hook is *always* called, even if an exception occurs during the operation.  Exceptions during the `after()` hook are logged.
    6. The `ReentrantLock` is released in the `finally` block.
- **External Interactions**:  None.  The class operates entirely in memory.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Exceptions during operation:**  Exceptions thrown within the `operateGlobalSynced()` method are caught. The `after()` hook is still executed, and the exception is re-thrown after the hook (allowing for error handling elsewhere).
    - **Exceptions during after hook:**  Exceptions thrown during the `after()` hook are caught and logged. The exception does *not* halt the release of the lock.
    - **Null Hooks:** The code handles the case where the `hooks` object is null gracefully by skipping the `before()` and `after()` hook calls.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:  The locking mechanism introduces overhead. Performance depends on the contention level for the lock and the execution time of the `MutexOperation`.  Should be reasonably fast for typical use cases.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability is limited by the single lock.  High contention can become a bottleneck.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within the class itself, but the synchronized object `T` may have security implications.
- **Maintainability**:  The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.  The use of interfaces (`Hooks`, `MutexOperation`) promotes modularity and testability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The `try-catch-finally` block ensures that the lock is always released, preventing deadlocks.
- **Usability**: The class provides a generic synchronization mechanism that can be used with any object type.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions:**
    - **`GlobalSynced(T syncedObject, Hooks<T> hooks)`:** Constructor. Initializes the synchronized object and hooks.
    - **`requestOperation(MutexOperation<T> m)`:**  The main method. Acquires the lock, executes the provided operation, and releases the lock.
- **Important logic flows**: The `requestOperation` method is the core logic, implementing the synchronized access pattern.  The `try-catch-finally` block within it is critical for ensuring lock release.
- **Error handling**:  Uses `try-catch-finally` to ensure the lock is always released, even in the presence of exceptions.  Logs exceptions occurring within the `after()` hook.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:  Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.mutex` package, indicating its role as a utility for mutex operations.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **Generics:**  Used to make the class type-safe and reusable with different object types (`T`).
- **Concurrency/threading:**  Uses `ReentrantLock` for thread synchronization.
- **Exception Handling**: Utilizes `try-catch-finally` blocks for robust error handling.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **SLF4J:** Used for logging via the `Logger` and `LoggerFactory` classes.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None explicitly listed in the code.  The `Hooks` and `MutexOperation` interfaces are internal to the project.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhanecements:** If contention on the lock is high, consider using a more sophisticated synchronization mechanism, such as a `StampedLock` or a concurrent data structure.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements:** No immediate security risks identified.  Ensure the synchronized object `T` itself is properly secured.
- **Scalability Considerations:** For very high-throughput applications, consider sharding the synchronized object or using a distributed lock.  The current implementation is limited by the single lock.
- **Metrics:** Add metrics to track lock contention, lock acquisition time, and execution time of the `MutexOperation`. This could help identify performance bottlenecks.
