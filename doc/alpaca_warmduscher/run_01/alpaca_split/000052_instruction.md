You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification belowOkay, this is a substantial and complex set of native SQL queries. Let's break down what's happening and discuss potential areas for improvement, considerations, and how to understand it.  I'll focus on the general approach, complexity, and potential areas for optimization.

**Overall Summary**

These queries all revolve around analyzing `heat_pump` data, extracting trends, and calculating statistics.  The queries progressively become more complex, focusing on increasingly granular analysis of boiler temperature over time (hourly, daily, etc.).  The use of window functions (`OVER()`) is *very* heavy, which is the key to a lot of the calculations.

**Key Concepts and Techniques**

*   **Window Functions:** The core of these queries.  Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows *related* to the current row, without grouping.  This is crucial for calculating things like `first_value`, `last_value`, `min`, `max`, and counts *within* a defined window (partition) of data.
*   **Partitioning:**  Window functions use `PARTITION BY` to define how the data is divided into groups.  For example, `PARTITION BY year1, doy, hour_of_day` means the calculations will be done separately for each year, day of the year, and hour.
*   **Ordering:** The `ORDER BY` clause within the `OVER()` clause specifies the order of rows *within* each partition.  This is essential for functions like `first_value`, `last_value`, and cumulative calculations.
*   **Date and Time Extraction:** Queries extract various components of the `measurement_date` (year, day of the year, hour, minute, day of the week) using functions like `extract` and `To_Char`.
*   **Nested Subqueries:** The queries are heavily nested. This can make them hard to read and understand, but it's often necessary for building up complex calculations step by step.
*   **`CASE` Statements:** Used to conditionally assign values (e.g., setting a value to 0 if a condition is met).

**Breakdown of the Queries (General)**

1.  **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`:** This query groups the data by a fixed interval (determined by `group_every_nth_second`) and calculates the average temperature within each interval. It's a basic form of time series aggregation.  This is the most straightforward of the queries.

2.  **`findBetweenDatesLimitByIntervalStats`:** Similar to the first one, but with slightly different grouping criteria.

3.  **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`:** The queries progressively become more complex, focusing on increasingly granular analysis of boiler temperature over time.

4.  **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`:** The queries progressively become more complex, focusing on increasingly granular analysis of boiler temperature over time.

5.  **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`:** The queries progressively become more complex, focusing on increasingly granular analysis of boiler temperature over time.

**Areas for Consideration & Potential Improvements**

*   **Readability:** These queries are extremely difficult to read.  Using proper indentation, aliases, and comments can significantly improve readability.  Consider breaking down the complex queries into smaller, more manageable steps using temporary tables or CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Indexing:** Make sure you have appropriate indexes on the `heat_pump` table, particularly on `measurement_date` and any columns used in `PARTITION BY` or `ORDER BY`.
    *   **Avoid unnecessary calculations:** Review the queries to see if any calculations are being performed that are not actually needed.
    *   **Materialization:** In some cases, materializing intermediate results (e.g., using temporary tables or CTEs) can improve performance.
    *   **Query Optimizer:** Check your database's query execution plan to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Avoid correlated subqueries:** Try to rewrite any correlated subqueries as joins or window functions.

*   **Complex Window Functions:** Some of the window function expressions are quite complex. Simplify these when possible or break them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

*   **Data Types:** Ensure that the data types of the columns used in calculations are appropriate. Using the wrong data types can lead to performance issues or incorrect results.

*   **Database-Specific Optimizations:** Different databases have different optimization techniques.  Consult your database documentation for specific recommendations.

*   **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):**  These can significantly improve readability and maintainability.  Replace some of the nested subqueries with CTEs.

**Example of Using a CTE (Illustrative)**

Let's say you have a complex subquery calculating some intermediate values. You could rewrite it as a CTE:

```sql
WITH IntermediateResults AS (
    SELECT
        -- Your complex calculation here
        column1,
        column2
    FROM
        heat_pump
    WHERE
        -- Your conditions here
)
SELECT
    -- Use the results from IntermediateResults
    column1,
    column2
FROM
    IntermediateResults
WHERE
    -- Additional conditions
```

**How to Approach Understanding These Queries**

1.  **Start with the outermost query:** Understand what the final result set should look like.
2.  **Work your way inwards:**  Step by step, analyze each subquery to understand what it calculates and how it contributes to the final result.
3.  **Draw diagrams:** Visualize the data flow and the relationships between the different subqueries.
4.  **Test incrementally:**  Run each subquery separately to verify that it produces the expected results.
5.  **Use a query formatter:**  Use a tool to format the SQL code to make it more readable.

**In conclusion:**

These are powerful and complex queries for analyzing time-series data.  However, they are also challenging to understand and maintain.  By focusing on readability, performance, and a systematic approach to understanding, you can make these queries more effective and easier to work with.  Don't be afraid to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. Remember to test each step and consult your database documentation for specific optimization recommendations.
