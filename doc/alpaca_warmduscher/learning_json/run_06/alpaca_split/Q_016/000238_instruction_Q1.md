For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts' with name 'my-http-interceptor.service.ts'...  How could you modify this interceptor to conditionally add the client ID header only for specific request URLs or methods (e.g., only add it to POST requests to '/api/data')? Explain your approach.
