Currently, the component lacks any responsiveness handling. The gauge chart's size is fixed to `width: 100px; height: 50px;` within the HTML. This means the chart will maintain these dimensions regardless of the `mat-card`'s size, potentially leading to overflow or a poorly scaled chart on different screen sizes.

To make the gauge chart responsive, we should utilize percentages for its width and height and allow the `mat-card` to control the overall size.

**HTML Changes:**

```html
<mat-card>
  <mat-card-content>
    <highcharts-chart
      [Highcharts]="highcharts"
      [options]="gaugeChartOptions"
      style="width: 100%; height: 100px;"
    >
    </highcharts-chart>
  </mat-card-content>
  <mat-card-footer>
  </mat-card-footer>
</mat-card>
```

*   **`width: 100%`**: This makes the chart take up the full width of its container (`mat-card-content`).
*   **`height: 100px`**:  This sets a fixed height in pixels but can be adjusted for more fine-grained control. Using `vh` or `%` could be used, but it may lead to scaling issues that aren't intuitive.

**TypeScript Considerations:**

The main TypeScript consideration would be ensuring that the `gaugeChartOptions` object is generated dynamically, if needed. For example, if the data driving the gauge chart changes, the chart options may need to be recalculated to maintain proper scaling or display.

Additionally, if the gauge chartâ€™s data is dependent on the screen size, you would need to listen for window resize events in the TypeScript component and update the `gaugeChartOptions` accordingly.

**Explanation:**

By setting the chart's width to 100%, it will now scale horizontally with the `mat-card-content`. The `mat-card` itself will likely adapt to the screen size, and the chart will scale accordingly.  A fixed height allows for a better visual presentation if the `mat-card-content` has a set height.  This approach simplifies the responsiveness without requiring complex calculations or dynamic chart option updates.  If further customization is needed (e.g., different chart sizes on different screen sizes), then more sophisticated CSS media queries or dynamic chart option generation would be necessary.
