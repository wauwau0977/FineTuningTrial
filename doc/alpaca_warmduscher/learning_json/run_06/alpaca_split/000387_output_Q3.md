The `adjustTimeAndReload()` method is responsible for dynamically adjusting the date range displayed on the chart based on user activity. It checks how long it has been since the last user interaction with the application.

The method is triggered by the `visibilitychange` event listener, which is activated when the document (i.e., the browser tab/window) gains or loses focus.  Essentially, when the user switches away from and then back to the application, or the browser tab becomes visible again, this method is called.

The method updates the date range if `lastActiveSinceSconeds` exceeds 180 seconds (3 minutes). If this condition is met, it uses `this.myForm.patchValue()` to set the `customFromDate` to 24 hours ago and the `customToDate` to now. The `customFromDateTimePart` and `customToDateTimePart` are set to the current hour and the next hour respectively, effectively showing a 24-hour rolling window. The `lastUserActivationTime` is also updated to the current time. If the current route contains "insights", the method includes commented-out code to display a snackbar message indicating that the graph data has been updated. Finally, the method calls `this.calculateAutoInterval()` to recalculate the appropriate interval for the chart data and `this.myReload()` to fetch and display the updated data.
