For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/heatingEntity.ts' with name 'heatingEntity.ts'...
Looking at the properties of the `HeatingEntity` class (e.g., `boilerTemp`, `boilerTempMin`, `boilerTempMax`), what design patterns or principles might be applied to reduce code duplication and improve the organization of these related properties?
