To redirect `/old-path` to `/new-path`, you would use the `pathMatch` property set to 'full' and a `redirectTo` property within a route object. Hereâ€™s how the `routes` array would be modified:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'old-path', redirectTo: '/new-path', pathMatch: 'full' }
];
```

Explanation:

*   `path: 'old-path'` matches the URL path we want to redirect from.
*   `redirectTo: '/new-path'` specifies the URL we want to redirect to.
*   `pathMatch: 'full'` ensures that the entire path matches before the redirection is applied. Without this, a path like `/old-path/something` would *also* be redirected.
