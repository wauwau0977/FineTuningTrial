The `downloadFileFromURL` method is responsible for actually downloading the maven wrapper JAR file from a given URL and saving it to a specified destination file. It opens a connection to the URL, reads the data using a ReadableByteChannel, and writes that data to a FileOutputStream.

Potential improvements:

*   **More Specific Exception Handling:** Currently, the method throws a generic `Exception`. It would be better to catch more specific exceptions like `MalformedURLException`, `IOException` (which can occur during stream operations), and handle them appropriately (e.g., logging the error and potentially re-throwing a more descriptive exception or returning an error code).
*   **Try-with-resources:** The code would benefit significantly from using try-with-resources to ensure that both `rbc` and `fos` are properly closed, even if an exception occurs. This eliminates the need for explicit `close()` calls in a `finally` block and prevents resource leaks.
*   **Buffering:** While not critical for smaller files, for larger JAR files, adding a buffer to the `transferFrom` operation could improve performance.
*   **Input Stream Validation:** It might be beneficial to check if the input stream from the URL is valid before attempting to transfer data.

Here's how the method could be improved using try-with-resources:

```java
private static void downloadFileFromURL(String urlString, File destination) throws Exception {
    try (ReadableByteChannel rbc = Channels.newChannel(new URL(urlString).openStream());
         FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(destination)) {
        fos.getChannel().transferFrom(rbc, 0, Long.MAX_VALUE);
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        // Handle URL errors (e.g., invalid URL format)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid URL: " + urlString, e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle IO errors (e.g., network issues, file access problems)
        throw new IOException("Error downloading file from " + urlString, e);
    }
}
```
