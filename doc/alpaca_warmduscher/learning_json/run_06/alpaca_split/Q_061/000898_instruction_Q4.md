For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' we have the following question: 

The interface defines methods for retrieving minimum and maximum values for several measurements (e.g., `getBoilerTempMin()`, `getBoilerTempMax()`, `getCompressorHoursMin()`). Explain the purpose of having both minimum and maximum values available for these metrics. Provide a scenario where these min/max values would be useful in a real-world application.
