The `getBoilerStatsByHour` method aims to calculate boiler statistics aggregated by the hour. Let's break down each subquery:

*   **h1 (innermost):** This query isn't explicitly defined but is represented within h2. It likely selects basic heat pump data – `measurement_date`, `boiler_temp`, etc. – from the `heat_pump` table, filtering by a date range. It forms the base dataset for further processing.

*   **h2:** This subquery introduces window functions (`first_value`, `last_value`) to determine the first and last measurement within each hour. It calculates `measurement_date_t0`, `measurement_date_t1`, `boiler_temp_window_t0`, `boiler_temp_window_t1`, `boiler_temp_window_tMin`, and `boiler_temp_window_tMax` for each hour. Essentially, it's finding the range of measurements within each hour.

*   **h3:**  This subquery calculates `boiler_temp_max_decrease_in_window` and `boiler_temp_max_increase_in_window`. It’s calculating the largest decrease and increase in boiler temperature *within* each hourly window.  The `GREATEST` and `-` operations determine these differences, and they're intended to identify temperature fluctuations within each hour.

*   **h4:** This subquery adds a `num_of_statistic_records_1` column, which appears to be a simple count of all records. It introduces the overall record count.

*   **h5:** This subquery groups the data by year, day of year (doy), and hour of day. It calculates the min and max values of several fields for each hourly group. This is a crucial aggregation step.

*   **h6:** This query aggregates data by hour of the day.

*   **h7:** This outermost query groups the data again by hour, calculates the average, and orders the results. It finalizes the aggregation and prepares the data for presentation.

In essence, the queries progressively filter, calculate differences, and aggregate data to obtain hourly statistics about boiler temperature fluctuations. The use of nested subqueries and window functions allows for complex calculations within each hour before aggregating the results across all hours.
