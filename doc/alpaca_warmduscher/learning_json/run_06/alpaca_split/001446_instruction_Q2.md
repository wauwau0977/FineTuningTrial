For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/MemoryInfo.java' with name 'MemoryInfo.java'... 
Considering the `getCurrent()` method: `MemoryInfo memoryInfo = new MemoryInfo(); ... return memoryInfo;`. What potential issues could arise from this approach in a multi-threaded environment, and how could you mitigate them?
