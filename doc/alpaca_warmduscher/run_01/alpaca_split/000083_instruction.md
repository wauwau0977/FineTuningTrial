You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines the root routing module for the 'Warmduscher' Angular application. Currently, it is a basic module that initializes the Angular Router but does not define any specific routes. It serves as the foundation for defining navigation pathways within the application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app-routing.module.ts
- **Class Name(s):** AppRoutingModule

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Initializes the Angular Router and provides a base for defining application routes.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  There are no direct user inputs or outputs for this module. It’s a foundational component that *enables* user interactions through defined routes (which are currently absent).
- **Workflow/Logic**: The module imports `RouterModule` and defines an empty `routes` array.  It then uses `RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` to configure the router with this empty array.  Finally, it exports `RouterModule` so other modules can access it.
- **External Interactions**:  The module interacts with the Angular Router.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Currently, the module handles the case of no routes defined gracefully by initializing a router without any specific navigation paths.  If `RouterModule.forRoot()` were called with an invalid route definition, Angular's router would likely throw an error during application startup.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal impact on performance, as it only initializes the router.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability isn’t a direct concern for this module itself; it's determined by the complexity of the routes *added* to the `routes` array.
- **Security**: No direct security implications. Security is handled at the route level through authentication/authorization mechanisms.
- **Maintainability**:  Simple and easily maintainable. Adding routes is straightforward.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  High reliability, as it’s a basic initialization module.
- **Usability**: Provides the foundation for a navigable application.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`AppRoutingModule` Class:** The primary component of the module. Exports a class used to configure the router.
- **`routes` Constant:** An empty array of `Routes` that serves as the base for defining application routes.
- **`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)`:** Configures the Angular Router with the defined routes.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling within the module itself. Angular Router handles errors related to invalid route configurations.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **TypeScript**: Used for defining the class and types.
- **Arrays**: Used to define the routes.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **@angular/core**: Provides the `NgModule` decorator and core Angular functionalities.
- **@angular/router**: Provides the `RouterModule`, `Routes`, and core routing functionalities.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None apparent in this code snippet.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Route Definition:** The most significant improvement is to *define* the application's routes. This would involve adding objects to the `routes` array, specifying components to render for different URLs.
- **Lazy Loading:** For larger applications, consider using lazy loading of modules to improve initial load time.
- **Guard Implementation**: Incorporate route guards to control access to certain routes based on authentication or authorization.
- **Configuration**: Consider externalizing the route configuration (e.g. a JSON file) to allow for easier modification without code changes.
