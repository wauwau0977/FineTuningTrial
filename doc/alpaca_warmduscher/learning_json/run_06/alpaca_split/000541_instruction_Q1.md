For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.ts'... 
The component uses a `subscribe` property initialized with `interval(10000)`. What is the potential downside of using a subscription like this directly within a component without proper unsubscription, and what steps should be taken to mitigate this risk?
