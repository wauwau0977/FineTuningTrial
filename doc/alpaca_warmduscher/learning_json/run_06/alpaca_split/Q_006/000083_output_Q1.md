`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` should *only* be used once in the root application module (typically `AppModule`). It initializes the entire router infrastructure and sets up the base URL for all routes.  It's essential for establishing the router's core functionality.  

`RouterModule.forChild(routes)` is used in *lazy-loaded modules* or feature modules. It assumes that the root router has already been initialized using `forRoot`. It adds routes to an existing router configuration.  It doesn't re-initialize the router; it extends it.

Choosing between the two:

*   **`forRoot`:** Use in the `AppModule` (or the module that's responsible for bootstrapping the application).  This is where you define the primary routes of your application.
*   **`forChild`:** Use in any lazy-loaded module (e.g., a module for user profiles, admin features, or specific sections of the application). This allows you to define routes that are specific to that module without affecting the main application routing.  Using `forChild` ensures that the application remains modular and only loads the necessary routing configurations when the module is loaded.

Using `forRoot` in a child module would cause errors and likely break the routing in the application.
