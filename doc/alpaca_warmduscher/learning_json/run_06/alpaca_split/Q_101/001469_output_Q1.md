A web app manifest is a JSON file that provides metadata about a web application. It's used to enhance the user experience, especially on mobile devices, by allowing the web application to be "installed" on the home screen, similar to a native app.

Functionality enabled by a web app manifest includes:

*   **Installability:** Allows users to add the web app to their home screen, creating an icon that launches the app.
*   **App Icons and Splash Screen:** Defines the icons and splash screen displayed during installation and launch.
*   **Name and Short Name:** Specifies the app's name and a shorter name for use on the home screen.
*   **Background Color:** Sets the background color of the splash screen.
*   **Display Mode:** Controls how the app is displayed (e.g., standalone, fullscreen, minimal-ui).
*   **Theme Color:** Specifies the theme color of the app.
*   **Offline Capabilities (with Service Workers):**  When combined with a Service Worker, the manifest enables offline functionality, allowing the app to work even without an internet connection.
*   **Launch URL:** Defines the URL that is loaded when the app is launched.
