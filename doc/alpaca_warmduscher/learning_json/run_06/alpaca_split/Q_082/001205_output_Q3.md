The assertions `assert entries != null : "Entries must not be null";` and `assert valueSupplier != null : "Supplier must not be null";` at the beginning of the `getMedian` method serve as runtime checks to ensure the method receives valid input.

These checks are crucial for code robustness and preventing unexpected behavior for the following reasons:

*   **Preventing NullPointerExceptions:** If `entries` or `valueSupplier` were null, subsequent operations within the method (like iterating through `entries` or calling `valueSupplier.applyAsDouble()`) would likely result in a `NullPointerException`, crashing the program or leading to incorrect results.
*   **Early Error Detection:** Assertions help detect errors early in the development process. If an assertion fails (meaning a null value was passed when it shouldn't be), it immediately throws an `AssertionError`, indicating a problem with the caller's code. This makes it much easier to debug and fix issues.
*   **Defensive Programming:**  Assertions are a form of defensive programming, where you proactively check assumptions and handle potential errors to make your code more reliable.
*   **Contract Enforcement:** Assertions effectively define a contract for the method's inputs. They clearly specify what the method expects from the caller, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
