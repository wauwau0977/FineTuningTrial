The primary risk with autowiring beans *after* the application context is fully initialized is circular dependency issues, or situations where partially constructed beans are injected into each other before they are fully ready. Spring's initial dependency injection handles these scenarios during context creation. Late autowiring bypasses this early resolution.

Specifically, if `beanA`’s autowire depends on `beanB`, and `beanB`’s autowire depends on `beanA`, calling `autoWire` on either bean could lead to a StackOverflowError or an incomplete object graph.  The `beanFactory.autowireBean()` method doesn't have the same safeguards as the initial context creation, and might not detect or resolve circular dependencies effectively.

Another risk is potential state inconsistencies. If a bean has a lifecycle method (like `@PostConstruct`) that depends on all its dependencies being fully initialized, late autowiring might cause that method to execute before all dependencies are ready, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Potential solutions include:

1.  **Avoid late autowiring whenever possible:** Design the application to rely on Spring's standard dependency injection during context initialization. This is the best approach.
2.  **Careful dependency management:**  If late autowiring is necessary, meticulously analyze dependencies to prevent circular dependencies or incomplete object graphs.
3.  **Consider using a dependency injection framework feature:** Some frameworks offer more advanced techniques for managing dependencies and resolving circular dependencies, such as setter injection or constructor injection with optional dependencies.
4.  **Defensive Programming:** Within the autowired bean, add checks to ensure dependencies are not null before accessing them. This can help mitigate issues arising from incomplete autowiring.
5.  **Limited Scope:** Restrict the use of `autoWire` to specific, well-understood cases where you're confident it won't introduce problems.
