The `arearange` chart type is used to display a range of values for each data point, in this case, likely the minimum and maximum temperature readings for the heating return and supply temperatures. Instead of a single line or point, it creates an area shaded between the minimum and maximum values, visually representing the temperature fluctuation over time. This is ideal for showing the spread or variability of data, providing more insight than a simple average or single value.

The `zIndex` property controls the layering order of the series. A higher `zIndex` value means the series will be drawn on top of series with lower `zIndex` values. In this example, `Heizung Vorlauf` has a `zIndex` of 1 and `Heizung Rücklauf` has a `zIndex` of 0. This ensures that the `Heizung Vorlauf` area is visually on top of the `Heizung Rücklauf` area, potentially allowing better visual distinction when the areas overlap. This is useful for highlighting a specific series when both are plotted on the same chart.
