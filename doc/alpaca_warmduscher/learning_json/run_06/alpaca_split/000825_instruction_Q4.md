For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/SessionRequestRepository.java' with name 'SessionRequestRepository.java' we have the following question: 
Explain the purpose of the `SessionRequestRepository` interface. Detail what functionality it provides and how it interacts with the data layer. Specifically, describe the role of `CrudRepository` and its implications for this interface. What data type does it manage and what is the key identifier type used for accessing that data?
