Applying the class `.textBig` to an element adds a bottom margin of 1 pixel.  The intention behind such a small bottom margin is likely subtle visual spacing. It's not about creating large separation, but rather adding a tiny amount of breathing room between the element with this class and the one that follows it. This could be for aesthetic reasons—to prevent elements from appearing too tightly packed—or to address a specific layout issue where a slightly larger margin would be undesirable. It's a fine-grained adjustment to visual presentation.
