`JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance()` returns a singleton instance of the `JacksonFactory`.  The benefit is that it's very simple and requires no configuration. It's also generally efficient since only one instance is created.

However, there are drawbacks. Primarily, it introduces a static dependency which can make testing more difficult. Mocking or replacing the factory becomes challenging as it's a global, static resource. In a multi-threaded environment, itâ€™s generally considered thread-safe as `JacksonFactory` is designed to be immutable after initialization. However, if any custom configurations were to be applied to the global instance (which isn't done here, but is possible with `JacksonFactory`), those configurations could be shared and potentially lead to unexpected behavior if different threads modify them. The code as-is doesn't present an immediate threading issue, but it's something to be mindful of with complex configurations.
