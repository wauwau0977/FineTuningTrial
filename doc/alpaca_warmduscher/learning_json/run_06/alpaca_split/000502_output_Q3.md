The `emptyInstance()` method creates and returns a new `MeteoSwissEntity` object initialized with default or empty values for all its properties. This is a common pattern used to provide a safe, default object when data is missing or not yet available.

In the `Warmduscher` application, it would be useful in scenarios like:

*   **Initialization:** Providing an initial value for a variable before actual data from the MeteoSwiss service is loaded.
*   **Error Handling:** Returning a default object if the service call fails or returns invalid data, preventing errors from accessing undefined properties.
*   **UI Display:** Providing a placeholder object for displaying data in the user interface before the real data arrives.
*   **Preventing Null/Undefined Errors:** Ensuring that the application always has a valid object to work with, avoiding potential runtime errors caused by null or undefined values.
