Throwing `Throwable` is generally discouraged because it's too broad. It catches *everything*, including exceptions you didn't anticipate or want to handle at this level. This can mask bugs and make debugging difficult. It forces calling code to either catch `Throwable` (which is overly broad) or declare `throws Throwable` (which is a bad signal to the caller), or wrap it in a `RuntimeException`.

A better approach is to define a specific exception hierarchy relevant to heating data retrieval. For example:

```java
public class HeatingDataReadException extends Exception {
    public HeatingDataReadException(String message) { super(message); }
    public HeatingDataReadException(String message, Throwable cause) { super(message, cause); }
}

public class HeatingDataNotFoundException extends HeatingDataReadException {
    public HeatingDataNotFoundException(String message) { super(message); }
}

public class HeatingDataCommunicationException extends HeatingDataReadException {
    public HeatingDataCommunicationException(String message, Throwable cause) { super(message, cause); }
}
```

Then, the interface would be refactored as:

```java
public interface HeatingDataReadService {
   void init() throws Exception;
   HeatPumpEntity getData() throws HeatingDataReadException;
   List<String> scanAllRegisters(int maxRegister);
}
```

This change provides several benefits:

*   **Clarity:**  Callers immediately understand the types of errors they might encounter.
*   **Targeted Handling:** Callers can catch specific exceptions (e.g., `HeatingDataNotFoundException`) and handle them accordingly.
*   **Robustness:** Avoids catching unexpected exceptions that might indicate deeper problems.
*   **Maintainability:** Makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
