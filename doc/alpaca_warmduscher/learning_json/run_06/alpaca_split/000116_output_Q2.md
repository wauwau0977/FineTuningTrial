The `flex-direction: column` and `align-items: center` properties are used to vertically center the content *within* each toolbar button. Let's break it down:

*   **`flex-direction: column`**: This establishes a flex container and arranges the flex items (in this case, likely an icon and the `span` containing text) vertically, one on top of the other. The default `flex-direction` is `row`, so this changes the flow of the content.

*   **`align-items: center`**:  This property aligns the flex items along the *cross axis*. Since `flex-direction` is set to `column`, the cross axis is horizontal. Therefore, `align-items: center` horizontally centers the `span` element within the buttonâ€™s width.

Combined, these properties ensure that the text within the button is neatly vertically stacked and horizontally centered, providing a consistent and visually appealing layout.  Without these, the text would likely align to the top or left of the button. The `span` having `display: block` ensures it takes the full width available after centering, as inline elements are only as wide as their content.
