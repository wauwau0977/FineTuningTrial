The `getMeteoSwissHistorical` method retrieves historical weather data from the MeteoSwiss service. It fetches data between a specified `from` and `to` date (both Moment objects), with an optional limit on the number of data points (`maxRows`), and the grouping interval (`groupEveryNthSecond`).

**Handling of `stationIds`:**

The `stationIds` parameter is a `Set<string>` representing the IDs of the weather stations for which to retrieve data. The code checks if `stationIds` is not null. If itâ€™s provided, it iterates through the set and concatenates the station IDs into a comma-separated string (`stationIdList`). This string is then added as a parameter to the HTTP request using `p.set('stationId', stationIdList)`.  This allows the client to request historical weather data for specific locations, rather than all available stations.

**Function of `doNotCache`:**

The `doNotCache` parameter is an optional boolean. If set to `true`, it bypasses the caching mechanism for this particular request. This is useful when you need to ensure that the data is always fetched from the server, regardless of whether it exists in the cache.  The `this.cacheService.get()` method uses this flag, thus preventing data retrieval from the cache.

**Construction of the HTTP Request:**

The method builds an HTTP request using `HttpParams`:

1.  It creates an instance of `HttpParams`.
2.  It adds the `start`, `end`, `maxRows`, and `groupEveryNthSecond` parameters to the `HttpParams` object. These parameters are converted to strings using the `toJSON()` method of the Moment objects.
3.  If `stationIds` are provided, it adds a `stationId` parameter with the comma-separated list of station IDs.
4.  Finally, it uses the `HttpClient` service (`this.http.get()`) to make a GET request to the `/meteo-swiss/getBetweenDates` endpoint, passing the constructed `HttpParams` object as the `params` option.  The `cacheService.get()` method then handles caching the result based on the `evictCache` and `doNotCache` flags.
