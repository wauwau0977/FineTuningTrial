For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java'... 
The interface includes `String getDayOfWeekText()`. Assuming this is populated with a localized day-of-week name (e.g., "Monday", "Dienstag"), what considerations should be made when designing the concrete implementation of this interface to handle different locales (languages)?
