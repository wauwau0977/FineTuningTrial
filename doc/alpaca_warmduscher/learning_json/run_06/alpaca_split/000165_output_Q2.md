These providers are used to configure the application's locale, specifically setting it to Swiss German (`'de-CH'`). This ensures that date formats, number formats, currency symbols, and other locale-specific elements are displayed correctly for users in Switzerland.

* **`LOCALE_ID`:** This provider sets the global locale for the entire Angular application. It affects how Angular's built-in internationalization (i18n) features work. It's used for things like formatting dates and numbers when using Angular's date pipes or number pipes.

* **`MAT_DATE_LOCALE`:** This provider specifically configures the locale for Angular Material's date-related components (e.g., `MatDatepicker`).  While `LOCALE_ID` might influence some date formatting, `MAT_DATE_LOCALE` is essential to ensure that Angular Material's date picker displays the correct first day of the week, date formats, and month names for the Swiss German locale.

Both are necessary because Angular Material's components don't automatically inherit the global `LOCALE_ID`.  If only `LOCALE_ID` were set, the `MatDatepicker` might still display dates in a different format (e.g., the default English format) or use incorrect month names. Setting both ensures consistent and correct localization throughout the application, particularly for date-related UI elements.
