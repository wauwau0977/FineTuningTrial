Using `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` means the cache is stored entirely in the application's JVM heap. This is a very simple, in-memory cache. 

**Advantages:**
*   **Simplicity:** Extremely easy to set up and requires no external dependencies.
*   **Performance:** Very fast for reads and writes due to its in-memory nature.
*   **No External Dependency:** Doesnâ€™t require setting up or maintaining a separate caching server.

**Disadvantages:**
*   **Limited Capacity:** Cache size is limited by available JVM heap space.
*   **No Persistence:** Data is lost when the application restarts.
*   **Not Scalable:** Not suitable for distributed caching environments.
*   **Single Instance:** Only available within the single application instance.

**Compared to Redis/Ehcache:**
*   **Redis/Ehcache (with remote configuration):** These provide much greater scalability and persistence. Redis is a dedicated in-memory data store that can be used across multiple application instances and persists data to disk. Ehcache offers various caching tiers, including in-memory, disk, and distributed caching. They both support more complex caching strategies and features like eviction policies and expiration times.  They are better suited for applications requiring a larger cache size, data persistence, or distributed caching.
*   **Complexity:** Redis and Ehcache introduce external dependencies and require configuration and maintenance, adding complexity to the application.

In the context of 'Warmduscher', this simple configuration suggests the caching requirement is likely small-scale or for transient data that doesn't need to survive application restarts.
