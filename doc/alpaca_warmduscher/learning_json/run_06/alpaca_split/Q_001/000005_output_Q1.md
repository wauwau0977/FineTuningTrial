The classes `mat-typography` and `mat-app-background` are specific to Angular Material, Google’s implementation of Material Design for Angular applications.

*   **`mat-typography`:** This class applies Angular Material's typography styles to the document. It defines a set of pre-defined font families, font sizes, and line heights that adhere to Material Design principles. This ensures consistent and accessible typography throughout the application. It likely applies specific CSS rules based on the defined Angular Material theme.
*   **`mat-app-background`:** This class applies a background color (defined by the current Angular Material theme) to the application’s main container (`<app-root>`). It’s part of the Material Design theming system and ensures that the application's background color matches the selected theme.

Together, these classes are essential for enabling and applying Angular Material's theming system. They allow developers to easily customize the appearance of the application by changing the theme colors and font settings. Without these classes, the application would likely not render with the intended Material Design styles. The `style=""` attribute on the body likely contains inline styles to override some initial Material theme styling.
