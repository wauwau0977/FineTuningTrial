The `final int kB = 1024;` line defines a constant integer variable named `kB` and assigns it the value 1024.  This constant represents the number of bytes in a kilobyte. It's used to convert the memory values returned by `Runtime.getRuntime()` (which are in bytes) into kilobytes.  This conversion is necessary for readability and a more manageable unit of measurement. Using a named constant instead of hardcoding the value 1024 directly makes the code more maintainable. If the definition of a kilobyte were to change, you'd only need to update this single constant, rather than searching and replacing the value throughout the code.
