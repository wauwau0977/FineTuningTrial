The `.toolbarNav` class defines the styling for a fixed-position toolbar at the bottom of the screen.  It has a background color of `#424242` and is positioned `fixed` at the `bottom: 0` of the viewport with a `z-index` of `1000` to ensure it stays on top of other elements. It uses `display: flex` to create a flexible layout, with `justify-content: space-around` distributing its children evenly across the width. It also includes a `1px` solid border at the top with the color `#303030`.  A negative `margin-left: -7px` is applied â€“ this is a "hack" likely to address some visual alignment issue or unwanted spacing. Padding-top of 10px is applied.

Direct children of `.toolbarNav` that are `button` elements are styled with `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, and `align-items: center`.  This arranges the content within each button vertically and centers it horizontally. The `width` of each button is set to `100%`.

Finally, any `span` elements nested within these buttons are styled with `display: block`. This causes them to take up the full width available within their parent button, enabling them to be displayed as a full-width block-level element.
