The primary drawback is loss of exception type information. Re-throwing everything as a `RuntimeException` obscures the *original* cause of the error. Debugging becomes significantly harder because the caller only sees a generic `RuntimeException` and loses crucial details about what specifically went wrong (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`, etc.). This makes root cause analysis more difficult and time-consuming.

Secondly, it bypasses the caller's intended exception handling. The caller might have been prepared to handle specific checked exceptions thrown by the `Callable`, but now itâ€™s forced to catch a broad `RuntimeException`. This violates the principle of least astonishment and can lead to unexpected application behavior if the caller isn't expecting unchecked exceptions. It's generally better practice to preserve the original exception type if possible, or at least wrap it with a more specific exception that provides context while retaining the original cause. A better approach would be to wrap the original exception in a custom `UnsafeExecutionException` and include the original exception as the cause using `throw new UnsafeExecutionException("Error executing Callable", e);`. This preserves the original error's type and allows for more targeted handling.
