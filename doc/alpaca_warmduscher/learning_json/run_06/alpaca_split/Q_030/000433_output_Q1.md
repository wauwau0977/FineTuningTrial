The `doNotCache` parameter acts as a bypass switch for the caching mechanism. If `doNotCache` is set to `true`, the `get` method will directly execute the `loader()` function and return the resulting `Observable` without attempting to retrieve from or store to the `this.cache`.

Use cases for `doNotCache` could include:

*   **Real-time data:** When the data is expected to change frequently and caching would lead to stale information. For example, a live stock ticker or a constantly updating news feed.
*   **Sensitive data:** When caching sensitive data is undesirable for security or privacy reasons.
*   **Debugging/Testing:**  To ensure that the `loader()` function is being called and functioning correctly during development or testing.  It allows for verification of the data source without the interference of a potentially stale cache.
*   **One-time data loading:** When a piece of data is only needed once and caching it would be a waste of resources.
