For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.sass' with name 'about.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed...
```sass
.video-holder
  display: flex
  flex-direction: column
  align-items: center
.video
  height: 50vh
  object-fit: scale-down
  margin-bottom: 25px
```
How do the combined styles for `.video-holder` and `.video` contribute to the layout and responsiveness of the video element within the 'about' component?
