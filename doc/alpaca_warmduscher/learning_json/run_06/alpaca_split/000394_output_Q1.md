The `zones` settings in both `chartOptionsSoleTemp` and `chartOptionsSoleDeltaTemp` define colored regions within the chart series, effectively highlighting specific value ranges. In `chartOptionsSoleTemp`, the zones color the 'arearange' series, visually indicating the ranges between the sole inlet and outlet temperatures. In `chartOptionsSoleDeltaTemp`, the zones color the 'arearange' series based on positive or negative values, visualizing the temperature difference. The zones improve the chart's readability and help users quickly identify important trends.

The `linkedTo: ':previous'` property in `chartOptionsSoleTemp` links the `arearange` series to the preceding series (the first series defined, which is the `arearange` series itself). This means the area range will visually follow the line (or area) series. This property is used to show the range *around* the existing data, not *in addition to* it. Essentially, the second series will be visually stacked upon or integrated with the previous series, creating a combined visualization.
