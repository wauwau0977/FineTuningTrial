The current implementation of `getLastElement` has a potential performance issue because it iterates through the entire collection even after finding the last element.  This results in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the collection. For large collections, this can be inefficient.

Specific collection types also impact performance:

*   **`LinkedList`:**  Iterating a `LinkedList` is slower than iterating an `ArrayList` because of the way elements are stored in memory (nodes scattered across memory instead of contiguous array). This method will be particularly inefficient with `LinkedList`s.
*   **Immutable Collections:**  Iterating over an immutable collection may involve creating copies, further degrading performance.

Improvements:

1.  **Use `size()` and direct access (if possible):** If the collection is a `List` (which guarantees indexed access), you can directly access the last element using `c.get(c.size() - 1)` in O(1) time. This is the most efficient solution.
2.  **`Iterator` with `remove()` (Less Efficient but possible):** While not ideal in this scenario, an iterator's `remove()` could be used to effectively step through and find the last element, although this adds complexity without improving performance in this case.
3.  **Check for empty collection:** Add a check at the beginning of the method to return null immediately if the collection is empty to avoid unnecessary iteration.

Example improved version (assuming itâ€™s a List):

```java
public static <T> T getLastElement(final List<T> c) {
    if (c == null || c.isEmpty()) {
        return null;
    }
    return c.get(c.size() - 1);
}
```
