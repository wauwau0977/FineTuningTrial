The `@Query` annotation allows you to define custom database queries directly within your repository interface. It overrides the default query methods provided by `CrudRepository` and enables you to execute specific SQL statements. In this case, it's used to retrieve the latest temperature entries for a given station.

The `nativeQuery = true` flag indicates that the query string is written in native SQL, rather than JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language). This means the query will be executed directly against the database, as-is.

**Benefits of using native SQL:**

*   **Performance:**  Native SQL can sometimes be more efficient than JPQL, especially for complex queries or when leveraging database-specific features.
*   **Flexibility:**  It allows you to access database-specific functions or features not supported by JPQL.
*   **Existing SQL:** It lets you reuse existing SQL queries without having to rewrite them in JPQL.

**Drawbacks:**

*   **Portability:** Native SQL queries are database-specific. Switching to a different database might require significant query modifications.
*   **Type Safety:**  Native SQL doesnâ€™t provide the same level of type safety as JPQL.  Errors might only be detected at runtime.
*   **Maintainability:**  Native SQL can be harder to maintain and debug than JPQL.
