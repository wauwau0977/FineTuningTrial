The `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` constant defines the interval, in seconds, at which a full page refresh is expected or, more likely, triggered. In this case, it's set to 86400 seconds (60 * 60 * 24), which equates to one day. This likely represents a mechanism to ensure the application refreshes its static assets or data from the server at least daily, potentially to pick up configuration changes or updates without requiring the user to manually refresh.

A beneficial scenario for increasing this value would be for applications with infrequently changing content or for users with limited bandwidth, as less frequent refreshes reduce server load and data usage. However, a detrimental scenario would be an application where data needs to be current (e.g., a stock trading platform). Decreasing this value to a shorter interval would ensure timely updates, but at the cost of increased server load and potential disruption to the user experience if refreshes happen during critical actions. A value too low could lead to unnecessary resource usage and a poor user experience.
