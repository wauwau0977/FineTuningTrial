You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This HTML component displays information about the "Warmduscher" project, detailing the hardware and software setup for monitoring a heat pump. It presents a series of visual cards, each explaining a different aspect of the system, including the Raspberry Pi hardware, communication protocols (Modbus), database (Postgres), server-side technology (Spring Boot), and the application's installability as a PWA.  The component includes images, text descriptions, and a video tutorial on PWA installation. It also displays client and server build timestamps.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.html
- **Class Name(s):**  This is an HTML template, not a class. It's associated with an Angular component (likely `AboutComponent`, although not visible in the provided code).

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Display informational content about the Warmduscher project.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:** This component is purely for display; there are no direct user inputs. Output is visual presentation of information within the browser.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The component simply renders a static set of cards in a defined order. Each card displays an image, a title, and descriptive text. The last card displays a video and associated text. The build timestamps are also displayed.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Displays images loaded from the `assets/images/` directory.
    - Embeds a video file from the `assets/videos/` directory.
    - Displays values for `buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer` which are likely passed from the Angular component.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - Video tag includes a fallback message if the browser does not support video tags.
    - Image loading failures are handled by the browser (default broken image icon). There is no explicit error handling within the HTML.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The component should load quickly, as it primarily displays static content. Image sizes should be optimized for web delivery.
- **Scalability:** Not applicable. This is a static display component.
- **Security:** Not directly applicable. The component displays static content; however, the source of the images and video should be trustworthy.
- **Maintainability:** The HTML is relatively well-structured with clear use of `mat-card` components. However, large changes would require modifications to the HTML.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The component's availability depends on the web server serving the files.
- **Usability:** The visual layout and content are intended to be easy to understand. The use of `mat-card` components provides a consistent look and feel.
- **Compliance:**  The component should adhere to web accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA attributes for images and videos).

## 5. Key Components

- **`mat-card`:** Angular Material component used to structure and display the information in individual cards.
- **`mat-card-header`:**  Header section of each card, containing the title.
- **`mat-card-image`:** Displays the image within the card.
- **`mat-card-content`:**  Contains the text description within the card.
- **`<video>` tag:**  Embeds and plays the video tutorial.
- **Image and Video Files:** Static assets used for visual presentation.
- **Build Timestamp Display:** Dynamically displays client and server build timestamps.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Utilizes `fxLayout` for responsive layout.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **HTML:**  Used for structuring the content.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the content.
- **JavaScript (via Angular):**  Used for dynamically loading the component and populating the build timestamps.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular Material:** Provides pre-built UI components (e.g., `mat-card`).
- **Angular Flex Layout:** Used for creating responsive layouts.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer`:** These variables are likely passed from the associated Angular component.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Optimize image sizes and consider lazy loading images to improve initial load time.
- **Code Readability:** While the HTML is reasonably readable, consider breaking down the larger sections into smaller, reusable components (e.g., a separate component for each card).
- **Accessibility:** Add ARIA attributes to images and videos to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.  Ensure sufficient color contrast for text.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Not applicable to this static display component.
- **Content Management:** Consider externalizing the text content into a separate configuration file or database to allow for easier updates without modifying the HTML.
