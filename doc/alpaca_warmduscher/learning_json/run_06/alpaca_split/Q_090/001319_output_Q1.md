Implementing the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface allows the `MvcConfig` class to customize the configuration of Spring MVC, such as adding interceptors, configuring view resolvers, or providing custom message converters. It provides a hook to fine-tune the applicationâ€™s web request handling.

The `addInterceptors` method is used to register request interceptors with the Spring MVC dispatcher servlet. In this case, it's registering an instance of `MyRequestInterceptor`, passing the `sessionRequestRepository` as a dependency.  This means that for every incoming HTTP request, the `MyRequestInterceptor` will be invoked *before* the controller is called, allowing it to pre-process the request or perform actions such as authentication, logging, or request validation.

The benefit of using interceptors is that they provide a centralized and reusable mechanism for handling cross-cutting concerns that apply to multiple controllers or requests. This keeps controller logic cleaner and more focused on business logic, and promotes code reuse and maintainability. Interceptors can be used for various purposes, including security, auditing, performance monitoring, and request transformation.
