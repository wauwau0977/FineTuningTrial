The `isSessionRelevantRequest` method determines whether a given HTTP request should be tracked and a session record created. It achieves this by filtering out requests for static resources and specific paths.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **`String path = request.getRequestURI();`**:  It retrieves the URI of the request.
2.  **`Stream.of("html", "htm", "css", "png", "svg", "woff", "woff2", "json", "js").noneMatch(s -> StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase(path, s))`**: This checks if the request path ends with any of the specified file extensions (HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript, etc.). If it *does* match (meaning itâ€™s a static resource), the `noneMatch` condition returns `false`, and the method will eventually return `false` (meaning the request is *not* relevant).
3.  **`!StringUtils.equals("/", path)`**: It checks if the request path is just the root path ("/"). If it is, the request is not relevant.
4.  **`!StringUtils.equals("/pi11", path)` && `!StringUtils.equals("/pi11/", path)`**: These conditions check if the request path is either "/pi11" or "/pi11/". If either is true, the request is not relevant.
5.  **`!StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase(request.getMethod(), HttpMethod.OPTIONS.name())`**: This checks if the request method is OPTIONS (commonly used for CORS preflight requests). If it is, the request is ignored.

If *all* of these conditions are met (meaning the request is *not* for a static resource, not the root path, not one of the specific "/pi11" paths, and not an OPTIONS request), the method returns `true`, indicating that the request *is* relevant and should be tracked. Essentially, it filters out noise and focuses on tracking meaningful requests that likely represent user interactions.
