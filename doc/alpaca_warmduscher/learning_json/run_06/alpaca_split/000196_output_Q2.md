Returning 'unknown' has several implications:

*   **Loss of Identification:** The application effectively treats clients without a valid ID as anonymous, preventing personalized experiences, tracking, or any functionality that relies on unique client identification.
*   **Potential for Incorrect Analytics:** Analytics data might be skewed by treating multiple clients as a single 'unknown' client.
*   **Security Concerns:** In some scenarios, revealing that a client has no ID might be a security risk, potentially allowing attackers to target anonymous clients.
*   **Debugging Difficulty:**  'unknown' is a generic value and makes it harder to trace the origin of issues related to client identification.

Alternative strategies:

1.  **Retry ID Generation:**  Instead of immediately returning 'unknown', the method could attempt to regenerate a client ID if `this.clientId` is null or empty. This could involve a simple retry mechanism or calling a dedicated ID generation function.
2.  **Throw an Error:** If a client ID is *required* for certain operations, throwing an error would force the calling code to handle the missing ID appropriately.
3.  **Return a Default ID:**  In some cases, it might be acceptable to return a pre-defined default ID for anonymous clients, allowing basic functionality to continue. (But this can skew analytics as mentioned above.)
4.  **Asynchronous ID Retrieval:** Instead of directly returning 'unknown', the method could return a Promise that resolves with the client ID once it becomes available, potentially triggering an asynchronous ID generation process.
5.  **Log and Continue:** Log the event of a missing client ID for debugging purposes, and then return a reasonable default or continue with limited functionality.
