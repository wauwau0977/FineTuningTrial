The `@Value` annotation is used to inject configuration properties from an external source (typically an application properties file or environment variables) into the corresponding class fields. In this case, it's being used to retrieve the mail sender's email address (`thserver.mail.sender`), the sender's password (`thserver.mail.password`), and the default list of recipient email addresses (`thserver.mail.receivers`).

These values are likely being provided through a Spring configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`). Spring's dependency injection mechanism will automatically read these properties from the configuration file and assign them to the `mailSender`, `mailPassword`, and `receiverMailsDefault` fields when the `MailSend` bean is created. This allows for easy configuration and modification of email settings without needing to modify the Java code directly. For example, the application.properties file may include a line like: `thserver.mail.sender=patrick.heusser.raspberry@gmail.com`.
