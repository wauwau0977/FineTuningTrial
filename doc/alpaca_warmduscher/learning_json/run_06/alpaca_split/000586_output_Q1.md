If the `declarations: [ OverviewCurrentComponent ]` line was omitted, the Angular testing framework wouldn't know about the `OverviewCurrentComponent`. This would lead to an error during test execution, likely stating that the component isn't recognized or found. Angular needs to know about the component to create an instance of it for testing and to resolve any dependencies it might have.

If other components were declared in the `declarations` array *besides* `OverviewCurrentComponent`, it would mean that those components are also being made available within the testing context. This isn't necessarily wrong, *if* the `OverviewCurrentComponent` depends on those other components. However, it introduces a few implications:

1.  **Increased Test Complexity:** The tests might implicitly test those additional components as well, making it harder to isolate issues specifically within `OverviewCurrentComponent`.
2.  **Slower Test Execution:**  More components to instantiate and configure will naturally increase the time it takes to run the tests.
3.  **Potential for Unintentional Side Effects:** If the added components have complex logic or side effects, they could unexpectedly impact the tests for `OverviewCurrentComponent`.

It's best practice to only declare the components that are directly relevant to the tests for a specific component, ensuring focused and reliable tests.
