You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component, `BoilerChartComponent`, displays historical heating data visualized as charts. It retrieves data from a `HeatingDataService` and presents it in various chart formats, including temperature trends, delta temperatures, and operational statistics. The component allows users to adjust the time range and data points displayed, and it adapts to different data sources and chart types.  It supports multiple MeteoSwiss stations for outdoor temperature data and offers customizable chart intervals.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerChartComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Retrieve historical heating and weather data.
    - Display data as various chart types (line, area).
    - Allow user control over the time range and number of data points displayed.
    - Support multiple MeteoSwiss stations for outdoor temperature data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**
        - `overviewMode`: Boolean flag to control the chart's display mode.
        - User selections for time range (start/end date/time) via a form.
        - User selection for chart data points or automatic interval.
    - **Outputs:**
        - Visual display of charts representing heating data.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. Component initializes by retrieving data from `HeatingDataService`.
    2. User can adjust the time range and data point settings via a form.
    3. Based on user input, the component fetches relevant data.
    4. The data is then formatted and displayed in various charts.
    5. The component dynamically updates the charts based on user input.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **`HeatingDataService`**: Retrieves heating and weather data.
    - **`FormBuilder`**: Creates and manages the user input form.
    - **`MatSnackBar`**: Displays snackbar notifications to the user (e.g., when the data is updated).
    - **`Router`**:  Used to potentially access different routes/views.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - **No Data Available:** Display appropriate message if no data is available for the specified time range.
    - **Invalid Date Range:** Handle invalid date ranges gracefully.
    - **Service Errors:** Handle potential errors from the `HeatingDataService`.
    - **Form Validation Errors:**  Validate user input in the form and display error messages.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - The component should load and display charts within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 5 seconds).
    - Chart updates should be responsive and avoid blocking the UI.
- **Scalability:**
    - The component should be able to handle a large number of data points without significant performance degradation.
- **Security:**  (Not a primary concern for this component, but good practice)
    - Ensure data retrieved from `HeatingDataService` is properly sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:**
    - The code should be well-structured, documented, and modular to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  (Relies on the `HeatingDataService`'s availability)
    - Handle potential service errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.
- **Usability:**
    - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
    - Chart types and settings should be clearly labeled and explained.
- **Compliance:**  (No specific compliance requirements mentioned)

## 5. Key Components

- **`BoilerChartComponent` Class:** The main component responsible for displaying and interacting with the charts.
- **`ngOnInit()`:** Initializes the component, subscribes to form changes, and fetches initial data.
- **`myReload()`:** Fetches data from the `HeatingDataService` based on user settings and updates the charts.
- **`visibilitychange()`:** Listens for document visibility changes to automatically refresh data when the tab is brought back into focus.
- **`getFromDate()` and `getToDate()`:** Helper functions to parse and format date and time values from the form.
- **Data Arrays:**  `boilerTempAverage`, `boilerTempMinMax`, `soleInTempAverage`, etc. â€“ store the data used to generate the charts.
- **Chart Configuration:** Highcharts options and configurations are used to define the chart appearance and behavior.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript
- Angular (Component, Input, Output, OnInit, HostListener, FormBuilder, Validators)
- RxJS (Observable, forkJoin, interval)
- Moment.js (date and time manipulation)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular Material:** (MatSnackBar) - For displaying snackbar notifications.
- **Highcharts:** (Typescript definitions also imported) - Charting library.
- **Moment.js**:  For working with dates and times.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`**: Provides access to historical heating and weather data.
- **`UtilsServiceService`**: Provides utility functions, including interval calculations.
- **`HeatingEntity`, `MeteoSwissEntity`, `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`, `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity`, `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`**: Data models representing heating and weather data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Implement data caching to reduce the number of calls to the `HeatingDataService`.
    - Optimize chart rendering by reducing the number of data points displayed.
    - Consider using virtual scrolling for large datasets.
- **Code Readability:**
    - Refactor large functions into smaller, more manageable units.
    - Add more comments and documentation to explain complex logic.
    - Use more descriptive variable names.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Implement input validation to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Ensure data retrieved from the `HeatingDataService` is properly sanitized.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Explore using a more scalable data storage solution for historical data.
    - Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large datasets.
- **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling, including logging and user-friendly error messages.
- **Test Coverage**: Add unit tests to cover critical component functionality.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the chart is responsive and displays correctly on different screen sizes.
