Ordering by `temperature_measure_date desc` without an index on that column will likely result in a full table scan. The database will need to read every row in the `meteo_swiss` table, sort them by `temperature_measure_date` in descending order, and *then* limit the results to `maxRows`. This becomes increasingly inefficient as the table grows.

To address this, I would recommend adding an index on the `temperature_measure_date` column in the `meteo_swiss` table. Specifically, a combined index on `(station_id, temperature_measure_date)` would be ideal, as the query filters by `station_id` *and* orders by `temperature_measure_date`. This allows the database to use the index for both filtering and sorting, significantly reducing query execution time.  The index creation statement would look something like this (depending on the specific database system):

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_meteo_swiss_station_date ON meteo_swiss (station_id, temperature_measure_date DESC);
```

The `DESC` keyword in the index definition mirrors the descending order in the query, which can further optimize the query plan.  Without the index, the query's time complexity would be approximately O(n log n) due to the sorting. With the appropriate index, the time complexity can be reduced to O(log n + k), where k is the number of rows returned (maxRows).
