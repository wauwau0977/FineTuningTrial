The `xDateFormat: '%A, %d.%m.%Y %H:%M'` setting controls the format of the date and time labels displayed on the x-axis of the charts. It's a string that uses a specific syntax (based on `strftime`) to define how the date and time values should be presented.  In this case:

*   `%A`: Full weekday name (e.g., Monday)
*   `%d`: Day of the month (01-31)
*   `%m`: Month as a number (01-12)
*   `%Y`: Year with century (e.g., 2024)
*   `%H`: Hour (00-23)
*   `%M`: Minute (00-59)

Therefore, the labels will appear like: "Monday, 27.10.2024 14:30".

To change the x-axis labels to only show the date (e.g., "2024-10-27"), you would modify the `xDateFormat` string to:

`xDateFormat: '%Y-%m-%d'`

This would remove the weekday and time components, leaving only the year, month, and day in the desired format. You could also use '%d.%m.%Y' for '27.10.2024' if that format is preferred.  The key is to remove the format codes corresponding to the parts of the date/time you donâ€™t want to display.
