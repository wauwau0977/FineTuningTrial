The `number: '1.1-1'` pipe is a formatting pipe that controls the number of decimal places and minimum integer digits displayed. In this case, `'1.1-1'` means:

*   **1**: Display at least one decimal place.
*   **.1**:  Display up to one decimal place.
*   **-1**: Ensure at least one digit before the decimal point. If the number is less than 1, it will show a leading zero.

Therefore, this pipe ensures that both the outdoor temperature from `heatingEntity` and the temperature from MeteoSwiss are displayed with at most one decimal place and at least one digit before the decimal. For example, 22.5, 0.5, or 100.0. This provides a consistent and readable format for the temperature values.
