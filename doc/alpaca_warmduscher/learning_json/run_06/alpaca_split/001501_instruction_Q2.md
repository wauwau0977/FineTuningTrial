For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java'... 
If the `HeatingModbusReadService` was extended to handle 32-bit unsigned integers from Modbus, how would the logic within `getSignedNumber()` (assuming itâ€™s still used to convert to a signed representation) need to be modified to correctly handle values exceeding 32767? What potential issues might arise with simply casting a 32-bit unsigned integer to a 32-bit signed integer?
