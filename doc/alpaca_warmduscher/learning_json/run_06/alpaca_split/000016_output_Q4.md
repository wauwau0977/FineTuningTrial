The CSS classes applied to the `<body>` tag, `mat-typography` and `mat-app-background`, are core to the styling and theming mechanisms of the application, and strongly indicate that the application is built using **Angular Material**.

*   **`mat-typography`**: This class applies a set of pre-defined typographic styles based on Angular Material’s typography system.  Angular Material provides a consistent and accessible typographic scale (headings, body text, labels, etc.) defined using CSS variables and classes. Applying `mat-typography` ensures that all text elements within the application inherit these styles, providing a consistent visual appearance.  It also handles default font sizes, line heights, and weights, adhering to Material Design principles.

*   **`mat-app-background`**: This class sets the background color for the entire application based on the current theme. Angular Material supports theming, allowing developers to customize the appearance of components.  `mat-app-background` likely maps to a CSS variable defined within the current theme that specifies the primary background color.  This ensures a consistent background across the entire app, adhering to the selected Material Design theme.

In essence, these classes are the entry point for applying Angular Material’s styling and theming to the application. They provide a consistent visual foundation and ensure that all components adhere to the Material Design guidelines. Without these classes, the application would likely lack the consistent appearance and accessibility features provided by Angular Material.
