To configure the test class to use an in-memory H2 database, I would add the following configuration to the `src/test/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file:

**application.properties:**

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create # or 'create-drop' for automatic schema creation/deletion
spring.flyway.enabled=false #Optional, if using Flyway and not wanting to run migrations during tests
```

**application.yml:**

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create # or 'create-drop'
  flyway:
    enabled: false #Optional, if using Flyway
```

**Explanation:**

*   `spring.datasource.url`:  Sets the JDBC URL to connect to an in-memory H2 database named "testdb".
*   `spring.datasource.driverClassName`:  Specifies the H2 JDBC driver class.
*   `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`:  Provide credentials for the H2 database (defaults are usually sufficient).
*   `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`:  This is important for automatically creating (or dropping) the database schema during testing.  `create` will create the schema if it doesn't exist.  `create-drop` will create the schema and then drop it when the application context is closed (good for clean tests, but can be slow).
*   `spring.flyway.enabled`: Disables Flyway migrations as they are likely intended for the production/development database, not the test database.

When Spring detects this configuration during testing, it will override the default database connection settings and connect to the in-memory H2 database instead.  This ensures that the tests are isolated from the production or development database and are faster and more reliable.
