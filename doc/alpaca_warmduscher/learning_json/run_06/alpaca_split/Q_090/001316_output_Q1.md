The `@Configuration` annotation marks this class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring application context. It essentially tells Spring that this class contains methods that will define and create beans managed by the Spring container.  

The `@Component` annotation is a general-purpose marker indicating that this class should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. Spring's component scanning mechanism will automatically detect this class and create an instance of it.

Using both together isn't inherently wrong, but it's often redundant.  `@Configuration` classes are *also* components, so Spring will find them with component scanning even without `@Component`.  The main difference is that `@Configuration` signals that the class primarily defines beans (often via `@Bean` methods), while `@Component` indicates a class that *is* a bean itself. In this case, it's likely used as an extra layer of clarity or for potential compatibility with different scanning configurations, but it could be simplified by removing `@Component` since `@Configuration` is sufficient.  However, removing `@Component` won't break functionality.
