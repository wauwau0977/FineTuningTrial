Accepting `data: any` introduces several potential issues:

* **Runtime Errors:**  If the `data` object is missing expected properties, accessing them (e.g., `data.id`, `data.measurementDate`) will result in runtime errors (e.g., "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined").  This is particularly problematic in JavaScript/TypeScript where these errors are often only discovered during testing or in production.
* **Type-Related Bugs:** Even if properties exist, they might have unexpected types.  For instance, `data.boilerTemp` might be a string instead of a number, leading to incorrect calculations or comparisons.
* **Reduced Code Maintainability:**  The lack of type information makes it harder to understand the expected structure of the input data and refactor the code safely.
* **Loss of TypeScript Benefits:**  TypeScript's primary benefit is static type checking.  Using `any` effectively disables this benefit for this method's input.

**Improvements for Type Safety:**

1. **Define an Interface/Type:**  The best approach is to define an interface or type that represents the structure of the expected data from the web service.  For example:

   ```typescript
   interface WebServiceHeatingData {
     id: string | null;
     measurementDate: string; // Or Date, if already formatted correctly
     boilerTemp: number;
     // ... other properties
   }
   ```

2. **Strongly Type the Input:**  Change the method signature to use the defined interface/type:

   ```typescript
   static ofWebService(data: WebServiceHeatingData) {
     if (data == null) {
       return this.emptyInstance();
     } else {
       return new HeatingEntity(
         data.id,
         HeatingDataService.convertDate(data.measurementDate),
         data.boilerTemp,
         // ... other properties
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Consider Optional Properties:** If some properties might be missing from the web service response, mark them as optional in the interface:

   ```typescript
   interface WebServiceHeatingData {
     id?: string | null;
     measurementDate?: string;
     boilerTemp?: number;
     // ... other properties
   }
   ```
   and handle the optional values safely (e.g. with the nullish coalescing operator `??`).

By defining a specific type for the input data, you enforce type safety, prevent runtime errors, and improve the maintainability of your code.
