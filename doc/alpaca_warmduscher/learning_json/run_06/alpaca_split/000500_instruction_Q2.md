For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts' with name 'meteoSwissEntity.ts'... 
Considering the constructor of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class:

```typescript
constructor(public id: string,
             public stationId: string,
             public stationName: string,
             public temperature: number,
             public temperatureMin: number,
             public temperatureMax: number,
             public temperatureMeasureDate: Date,
             public temperatureMeasureDateMin: Date,
             public temperatureMeasureDateMax: Date,
             public windGustSpeed: number,
             public windGustSpeedMin: number,
             public windGustSpeedMax: number,
             public windMeasureDate: Date,
             public windMeasureDateMin: Date,
             public windMeasureDateMax: Date) {
 }
```

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the `public` access modifier directly in the constructor parameters? Consider both code readability and potential maintainability issues.
