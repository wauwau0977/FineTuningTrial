The constructor of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class is responsible for creating and initializing instances of the class with specific data. It defines the initial state of a `MeteoSwissEntity` object.

The constructor accepts 15 parameters:

*   `id`: A string representing the ID of the MeteoSwiss entity.  This is used to initialize the `id` property.
*   `stationId`: A string representing the ID of the weather station. This is used to initialize the `stationId` property.
*   `stationName`: A string representing the name of the weather station. This is used to initialize the `stationName` property.
*   `temperature`: A number representing the current temperature. This is used to initialize the `temperature` property.
*   `temperatureMin`: A number representing the minimum temperature. This is used to initialize the `temperatureMin` property.
*   `temperatureMax`: A number representing the maximum temperature. This is used to initialize the `temperatureMax` property.
*   `temperatureMeasureDate`: A `Date` object representing the date and time when the temperature was measured. This is used to initialize the `temperatureMeasureDate` property.
*   `temperatureMeasureDateMin`: A `Date` object representing the date and time of the minimum temperature measurement. This is used to initialize the `temperatureMeasureDateMin` property.
*   `temperatureMeasureDateMax`: A `Date` object representing the date and time of the maximum temperature measurement. This is used to initialize the `temperatureMeasureDateMax` property.
*   `windGustSpeed`: A number representing the wind gust speed. This is used to initialize the `windGustSpeed` property.
*   `windGustSpeedMin`: A number representing the minimum wind gust speed. This is used to initialize the `windGustSpeedMin` property.
*   `windGustSpeedMax`: A number representing the maximum wind gust speed. This is used to initialize the `windGustSpeedMax` property.
*   `windMeasureDate`: A `Date` object representing the date and time when the wind speed was measured. This is used to initialize the `windMeasureDate` property.
*   `windMeasureDateMin`: A `Date` object representing the date and time of the minimum wind speed measurement. This is used to initialize the `windMeasureDateMin` property.
*   `windMeasureDateMax`: A `Date` object representing the date and time of the maximum wind speed measurement. This is used to initialize the `windMeasureDateMax` property.

Each parameter is directly assigned to the corresponding public property of the class using the shorthand property initialization syntax.

All properties are declared as `public`. This means they are directly accessible from outside the class. This design choice likely prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, allowing other parts of the application to readily access and manipulate the data within a `MeteoSwissEntity` object without requiring getter or setter methods. While it might compromise encapsulation to some degree, it can be acceptable in scenarios where the focus is on rapid development and straightforward data access.
