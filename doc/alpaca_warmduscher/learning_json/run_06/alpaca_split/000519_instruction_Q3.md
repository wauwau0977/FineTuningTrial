For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts' with name 'soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
 static emptyInstance() {
   return new SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity(new Date(), new Date(), 0, 0, 0, false, 0);
 }
```
What is the purpose of the `emptyInstance()` static method?  In what scenarios might this method be useful during the application's runtime?
