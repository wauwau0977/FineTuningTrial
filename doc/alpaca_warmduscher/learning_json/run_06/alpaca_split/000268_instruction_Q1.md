For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.ts' with name 'utils-service.service.ts'... The `Interval` class includes a static `compare` method for sorting. This method performs a simple numerical comparison.  What potential issues could arise if the `key` property of the `Interval` object were used for comparison instead of `intervalInSeconds`, and how would you address them?
