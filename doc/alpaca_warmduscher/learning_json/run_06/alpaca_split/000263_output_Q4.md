The overall goal of the test suite for `UtilsServiceService` is to ensure the correct functionality of the `UtilsServiceService`, with a particular focus on the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method. This method calculates the appropriate time interval (e.g., "1d", "1h", "4h") based on the number of data points and the time range provided. The tests aim to validate that the method accurately determines the optimal interval to maintain data clarity and prevent overcrowding when visualizing or processing time-series data.

The tests cover scenarios designed to verify the methodâ€™s behavior with varying numbers of data points and time ranges. The provided tests specifically cover a range of common scenarios and potentially some edge cases:

*   **Varying Data Point Density:** The tests cover scenarios with low (10 data points per week), medium (165 data points per week), and high (200, 360, 366 data points per year) data point densities to ensure the method adapts the interval accordingly.
*   **Different Time Ranges:** The tests use both weekly (1 week) and yearly (1 year) time ranges to verify that the method calculates the interval correctly regardless of the timeframe.
*   **Expected Interval Keys:** The tests explicitly check for expected interval keys ("1d", "1h", "4h", "3d") to ensure the method returns the correct granularity based on the input parameters.
*   **Boundary/Edge Cases:** The tests seem to include a few boundary or edge cases.  For instance, 360 and 366 data points per year is close to the maximum number of days in a year, potentially representing an edge case for interval calculation.

The tests aim to confirm that `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` provides reasonable interval values, preventing overcrowding with very short intervals (e.g., every minute) or excessive granularity with very long intervals (e.g., every month) based on the number of data points and the given time window.
