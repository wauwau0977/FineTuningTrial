For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.html' with name 'about.component.html'...
The `<div>` with class `buildTimestamp` displays client and server build timestamps. What potential benefits and drawbacks are there to including this kind of information directly within the UI, and what security considerations, if any, should be taken into account?
