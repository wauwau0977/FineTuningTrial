For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java' with name 'InfoBean.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
@Value("${thserver.buildTimestampServer}")
private String buildTimestampServer = "";
```
What is the purpose of the `@Value` annotation in this code snippet, and how does it populate the `buildTimestampServer` variable?
