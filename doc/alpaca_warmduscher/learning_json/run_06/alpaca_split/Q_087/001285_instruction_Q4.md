For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java' we have the following question: 
Explain how the `StartupData` class would be used in a larger Spring application context. Describe how another component could access and utilize the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` value. Provide a simple example of how dependency injection would be used to achieve this.
