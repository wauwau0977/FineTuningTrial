For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java' with name 'AuditLogEntity.java' we have the following question:
Explain the purpose and implementation of the `equals()` method in the `AuditLogEntity` class. What criteria does it use to determine if two `AuditLogEntity` objects are equal, and why is this specific comparison logic chosen? Provide the complete code for the `equals()` method.
