The purpose of having a method that always returns "Not implemented" is to satisfy the interface contract (`HeatingDataReadService`) while deferring the actual implementation. This is a common practice during development when you want to define the interface first and implement individual methods later.  It allows other parts of the application to interact with the service without requiring a complete implementation. It's a placeholder for future functionality.

Design considerations leading to this choice:

*   **Interface-driven development:** The team might be following an interface-driven design, where interfaces are defined before implementations.
*   **Progressive development:** It allows the team to focus on implementing core functionality first and add features incrementally.
*   **Mocking/Testing:** It is often used to provide a basic mock implementation for testing other components that rely on this service.

Potential downsides:

*   **Misleading API:** It might mislead developers into thinking the functionality is partially implemented when it isn't.
*   **Runtime errors:** Calling this method will result in a harmless but potentially confusing result. If the calling code *expects* actual register data, it will not get it and could lead to errors further down the line.
*   **Technical debt:** If forgotten, it represents technical debt that needs to be addressed in the future.
*   **Lack of clarity:** It doesn't clearly signal that the method is not yet implemented, potentially causing confusion. A more explicit message or exception might be better.
