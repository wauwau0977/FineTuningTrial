The standard Angular approach utilizes `fileReplacements` in `angular.json` along with environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `environment.prod.ts`, `environment.staging.ts`).

1. **Create Environment-Specific Files:**  I would create files like `environment.prod.ts`, `environment.staging.ts`, etc. These files would contain the same structure as `environment.ts` but with values tailored to the specific environment.  For example, `environment.prod.ts` might have `production: true` and a different `serviceBaseURL`.

2. **Configure `angular.json`:**  In the `angular.json` file, within the `build` section (for each configuration, like "production", "development", "staging"), I'd use the `fileReplacements` array to specify how to replace `environment.ts` during the build process.  For example:

```json
"configurations": {
  "production": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
      }
    ],
    // Other production build settings
  },
  "staging": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.staging.ts"
      }
    ],
    // Other staging build settings
  },
  "development":{
        "fileReplacements": []
  }
}
```

3. **Build with Configurations:** I would then build the application using the Angular CLI with the desired configuration: `ng build --configuration production`, `ng build --configuration staging`, or `ng build` (for development which uses `environment.ts` by default).

This approach keeps the environment-specific settings separate from the core code and allows for clean, configurable builds.  It avoids direct modification of `environment.ts`, ensuring consistency and version control.
