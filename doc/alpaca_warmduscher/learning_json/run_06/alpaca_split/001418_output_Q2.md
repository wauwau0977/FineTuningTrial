The `@RequestMapping` annotations are central to Spring MVC’s request mapping mechanism. They map incoming HTTP requests to specific handler methods within the controller.  In this case:

*   `@RequestMapping("/info")` at the class level defines a base URL for all requests handled by the `InfoService` controller.
*   `@RequestMapping("/general")` maps requests with the path `/info/general` to the `getInfo()` method.
*   `@RequestMapping("/memory")` maps requests with the path `/info/memory` to the `getMemoryInfo()` method.

These annotations are a crucial part of the application's overall architecture, enabling a clean separation between the request handling logic and the underlying business logic. They facilitate a front controller pattern where Spring’s DispatcherServlet receives all incoming requests and dispatches them to the appropriate controller based on the mapped URL patterns.

When a request with a specific path (e.g., `/info/general`) is made to the application, the following happens:

1.  The DispatcherServlet intercepts the request.
2.  The DispatcherServlet consults the registered HandlerMappings to find a suitable controller and handler method that matches the request path.
3.  If a match is found (in this case, `InfoService.getInfo()`), the DispatcherServlet invokes the handler method.
4.  The handler method (e.g., `getInfo()`) processes the request and returns a response.
5.  The DispatcherServlet uses ViewResolvers and content negotiation to render the response (e.g. as JSON because of `@ResponseBody`) and sends it back to the client.
