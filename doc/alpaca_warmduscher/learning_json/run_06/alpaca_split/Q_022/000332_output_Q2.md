The primary issue with returning `this.buildTimestampServer` in `getBuildTimestampServer()` is that it returns the *initial* value of the property, which will almost certainly be an empty string because the asynchronous call to `heatingDataService.getServerInfo()` hasn't completed yet. This makes the return value misleading and essentially useless.

Potential (though likely flawed) reasons someone might have included this return statement could be:

1.  **Attempt at Synchronization (Incorrect):** The developer might have incorrectly assumed that the `return` statement would somehow wait for the asynchronous operation to complete. This is not how asynchronous JavaScript works.

2.  **Leftover Code/Refactoring Incomplete:** It could be leftover code from a previous implementation that was not fully refactored when the asynchronous operation was introduced.

3.  **Misunderstanding of Asynchronous Operations:** The developer might have had a misunderstanding of how asynchronous operations and Observables work.

**Refactorings to improve the design and usability:**

1.  **Remove the Return Statement:** The simplest and most appropriate solution is to remove the `return this.buildTimestampServer;` statement entirely. The primary purpose of the method should be to *update* the `buildTimestampServer` property, not to return its initial value.

2.  **Return an Observable (Recommended):** Change the return type of the method to `Observable<string>` and return the Observable created by `this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo()`. This allows the calling component to subscribe to the Observable and react to the updated timestamp.  This promotes a reactive approach and avoids unnecessary synchronization.

   ```typescript
   getBuildTimestampServer(): Observable<string> {
     return this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo().pipe(
       map(info => info.buildTimestampServer)
     );
   }
   ```

3.  **Use a Subject/BehaviorSubject (If needed for wider reactivity):**  If multiple components need to react to the server timestamp, consider using a `BehaviorSubject` to hold the timestamp and emit updates whenever it changes.  The `getBuildTimestampServer()` method could then return the `BehaviorSubject`.

4.  **Convert to Promise (If integration with Promise-based code is required):** If the calling component primarily uses Promises, you could convert the Observable to a Promise using `toPromise()`. However, returning an Observable is generally preferred in Angular applications.

The best approach is to remove the misleading return statement and embrace the asynchronous nature of the operation by either returning an Observable or allowing the calling component to react to the property update directly.
