```java
public static int getSignedNumber(int value) {
    if (value > 32767) {
        return value - 65536;
    } else {
        return value;
    }
}
```
The method `getSignedNumber` effectively translates an unsigned 16-bit integer (represented as an `int` in Java) into a signed 16-bit integer.  The core logic hinges on the two's complement representation of signed integers.

In a 16-bit system, values from 0 to 32767 represent positive numbers and zero. Values from 32768 to 65535 represent negative numbers in two's complement.

The method checks if the input `value` is greater than 32767. If it is, it subtracts 65536 from the value. This subtraction effectively maps the upper half of the unsigned 16-bit range (32768-65535) to the negative range (-1 to -32768).

For example:

*   If `value` is 32768, the method returns 32768 - 65536 = -32768.
*   If `value` is 65535, the method returns 65535 - 65536 = -1.

If the input `value` is less than or equal to 32767, it's already within the positive range, so the method simply returns the original value. This ensures that positive numbers remain unchanged during the conversion.
