The current implementation retrieves the `clientId` from the request header (`TH_SERVER_SESSION_ID`). This approach is prone to manipulation by the client. A malicious or poorly implemented client could easily spoof the header, leading to incorrect session tracking or potentially security vulnerabilities (e.g., session hijacking if the ID is misused). It relies on the client *sending* the correct ID, which isn't trustworthy.

Alternative approaches to uniquely identifying a client include:

1.  **HTTP Cookie (as currently implemented for the session ID):** This is generally a more secure approach, as the cookie is set by the server and automatically included in subsequent requests by the browser. The server controls its value and scope.  However, cookies can be disabled or cleared by the user, leading to loss of tracking.

2.  **Fingerprinting (Browser/Device Characteristics):**  Collecting browser and device characteristics (user agent, screen resolution, installed fonts, etc.) can create a relatively unique "fingerprint." This is more resistant to simple manipulation, but raises privacy concerns and isn't perfectly reliable (users can change settings or use different browsers).  Also, it requires significantly more complex implementation and processing.

3.  **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT):**  If the application uses authentication, the authentication token (e.g., JWT) can serve as a unique client identifier.  This is a secure and reliable approach, but requires an authentication mechanism to be in place.

4.  **IP Address (with caution):** While possible, using IP addresses is unreliable due to dynamic IPs, NAT, and privacy concerns.  It's also susceptible to spoofing.

**Tradeoffs:**

*   **Security:** Cookies and tokens are the most secure. Fingerprinting and IP addresses are the least.
*   **Reliability:** Cookies are less reliable if disabled. IP addresses are unreliable due to network configurations. Tokens are highly reliable if the authentication system is robust.
*   **Privacy:** Fingerprinting raises significant privacy concerns. IP address tracking can also be considered intrusive.
*   **Complexity:** Fingerprinting is the most complex to implement.
