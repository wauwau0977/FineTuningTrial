Moment.js, while historically popular, presents several disadvantages in modern Angular applications. Its biggest drawback is its size. It’s a large library, contributing significantly to the bundle size, which impacts page load times and user experience. It’s also considered a legacy project with its maintainers discouraging new projects from using it. Additionally, it’s mutable, which can lead to unexpected side effects if not handled carefully.

However, it also offers advantages:  it's feature-rich, providing extensive formatting, parsing, and manipulation capabilities, and it’s widely used, meaning there's a lot of existing documentation and community support.

Modern alternatives to Moment.js include:

1.  **Date-fns:** This is a lightweight, modular library focused on functional programming principles. It allows you to import only the functions you need, resulting in a smaller bundle size. It's immutable, promoting predictable behavior.

2.  **Luxon:** Also an immutable date/time library, Luxon is a successor to Moment.js created by one of its original maintainers. It offers a more modern API and improved internationalization support.

3.  **Native JavaScript Date Object:** For simpler date/time operations, you can often rely on the native JavaScript `Date` object along with appropriate formatting tools. Modern JavaScript has improved date/time handling capabilities.

4.  **Temporal API (Proposed):** This is a new, built-in JavaScript API for date and time manipulation. It aims to address the limitations of the existing `Date` object and provide a more robust and user-friendly API. It's still under development but is becoming increasingly mature.

In the context of this service, using `date-fns` or, when stable, the Temporal API, would likely be the best approach. They offer a good balance between functionality, bundle size, and immutability.
