For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java' with name 'AuditLogEntity.java'... 
The `AuditLogEntity` has several `scope` fields (scope1, scope2, scope3). What are the potential design considerations for using these fields, and what are some alternative approaches to achieve the same goal with potentially better maintainability or flexibility?
