```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "MeteoSwissEntity{" +
            "id='" + id + '\'' +
            ", createDate=" + createDate +
            ", stationId='" + stationId + '\'' +
            ", sunshine=" + sunshine +
            ", sunshineMeasureDate=" + sunshineMeasureDate +
            ", temperature=" + temperature +
            ", temperatureMeasureDate=" + temperatureMeasureDate +
            '}';
}
```
The `toString()` method is overridden from the `Object` class to provide a human-readable string representation of a `MeteoSwissEntity` object. This is especially useful for debugging, logging, and general inspection of object state.

The method constructs a string that includes the values of the `id`, `createDate`, `stationId`, `sunshine`, `sunshineMeasureDate`, `temperature`, and `temperatureMeasureDate` fields.  

These fields were chosen because they represent core attributes of the weather data captured by the entity. The `id` is essential for identifying the specific record. `createDate` indicates when the entity was created in the system. `stationId` and `stationName` identifies the source of the weather data. `sunshine`, `sunshineMeasureDate`, `temperature`, and `temperatureMeasureDate`  represent the actual measured weather data that this entity stores. This combination provides a concise yet informative snapshot of the object's state, allowing for easy monitoring and diagnosis during development and runtime.
