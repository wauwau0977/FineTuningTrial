We can use a mocking framework like Mockito to create a mock implementation of the `Hooks` interface. This allows us to verify that the `before` and `after` methods are called with the expected arguments during the test.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

interface Hooks<T> {
    void before(T t) throws Throwable;
    void after(T t) throws Throwable;
}

class MyComponent {
    private Hooks<String> hooks;

    public MyComponent(Hooks<String> hooks) {
        this.hooks = hooks;
    }

    public void doSomething(String data) throws Throwable {
        hooks.before(data);
        // Actual component logic here
        hooks.after(data);
    }
}

public class MyComponentTest {

    @Test
    public void testDoSomething_callsHooksCorrectly() throws Throwable {
        Hooks<String> mockHooks = Mockito.mock(Hooks.class);
        String testData = "Test Data";

        MyComponent component = new MyComponent(mockHooks);
        component.doSomething(testData);

        verify(mockHooks).before(testData);
        verify(mockHooks).after(testData);
    }
}
```

In this example:

1.  We create a mock `Hooks` instance using `Mockito.mock(Hooks.class)`.
2.  We inject this mock instance into the `MyComponent` during construction.
3.  We call the `doSomething` method on the component, which will trigger the calls to the `before` and `after` hooks.
4.  We use `verify` to assert that the `before` and `after` methods were called with the expected `testData` argument.

This approach allows us to isolate the component under test and verify its interaction with the `Hooks` interface without actually executing the real hook logic.  We can also use `Mockito.times()` to verify the exact number of times each method was called.
