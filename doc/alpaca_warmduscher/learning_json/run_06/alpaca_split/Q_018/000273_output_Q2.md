Creating and sorting the `Interval` array every time `getStandardIntervals` is called has both benefits and drawbacks:

**Drawbacks:**

*   **Performance Overhead:**  Creating a new array and sorting it repeatedly can be computationally expensive, especially if `getStandardIntervals` is called frequently. The sorting operation (even with efficient algorithms) takes time, and the repeated creation of arrays also has a cost.
*   **Memory Usage:** Each call to `getStandardIntervals` creates a new array in memory, which adds to the applicationâ€™s memory footprint.

**Benefits:**

*   **Immutability:** Ensures that the `Interval` array is always fresh and not modified by other parts of the application.  This can simplify debugging and reasoning about the code.
*   **Thread Safety:**  If multiple threads were accessing and modifying the `Interval` array, this approach would avoid race conditions. (However, this code isn't explicitly designed for multi-threading).

**Alternative Approach: Caching**

A better approach would be to cache the sorted `Interval` array as a *static* property within the `UtilsServiceService` class. This means the array is created and sorted only once, when the class is initialized. Subsequent calls to `getStandardIntervals` would simply return the cached array.

Here's how it would look:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class UtilsServiceService {
  constructor() { }

  private static readonly standardIntervals = UtilsServiceService.getStandardIntervalsImpl();

  public static getStandardIntervals(): Interval[] {
    return UtilsServiceService.standardIntervals;
  }

  // ... other methods ...
}
```

This approach eliminates the repeated creation and sorting, significantly improving performance and reducing memory usage. It also maintains immutability because the cached array is never modified. The initialization happens only once upon service instantiation. This is a classic trade-off between memory usage (storing the array) and computational cost (repeated creation and sorting).
