Dependency Injection (DI) provides several benefits in this case. Primarily, it decouples `MyRequestInterceptor` from a specific implementation of the data access layer. Instead of creating a `SessionRequestRepository` instance *within* the interceptor, it's *provided* from the outside (likely from a Spring container).

This decoupling leads to several advantages:

* **Testability:**  During unit testing, we can easily inject a mock or stub `SessionRequestRepository` into the interceptor. This allows us to isolate the interceptor's logic and test it without relying on a real database or external system. We can verify that the interceptor correctly calls the repository's methods with the expected data.
* **Maintainability:** If the implementation of the data access layer changes (e.g., we switch from one database to another, or refactor the repository classes), we only need to configure the dependency injection framework to provide the new implementation. The interceptor code itself remains unchanged.
* **Flexibility:**  DI allows for easy swapping of implementations.  We can use different repositories in different environments (e.g., a mock repository in development, a real repository in production).
* **Reduced Coupling:** The interceptor is no longer directly responsible for creating and managing the lifecycle of the `SessionRequestRepository`, reducing its complexity and making it easier to understand and maintain.
