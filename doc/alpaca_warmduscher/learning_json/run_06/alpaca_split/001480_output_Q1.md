`SpringRunner` and `SpringJUnitConfig` are both used to run Spring-based tests, but they serve different purposes and are suited for different scenarios.

* **`SpringRunner` (JUnit 4):**  This runner is designed to automatically load the Spring application context.  It's the simpler option when you want a standard Spring Boot test with default context loading behavior. It automatically detects and configures a `WebApplicationContext` if a `web.xml` or a `@SpringBootApplication` class is present. It's the default for most basic Spring Boot tests.  It's used with JUnit 4.

* **`SpringJUnitConfig` (JUnit 4):**  This runner allows you to explicitly specify the configuration classes that should be used to create the Spring application context.  It provides more control over how the context is loaded. You would use it when you need to:
    * Provide a custom set of configuration classes.
    * Load a different context than the default one.
    *  Use a specific profile for the test.

In modern Spring Boot development, `SpringRunner` is less frequently used as Spring Boot's auto-configuration generally handles context loading well. `SpringJUnitConfig` is used when specific control over configuration is required, but usually auto-configuration is sufficient. For JUnit 5 (the preferred option for new projects), `SpringExtension` is used instead of either of these.
