The purpose of using `TreeMap` for `detailInfo` is to ensure that the key-value pairs in the map are sorted by key in ascending order. This provides a consistent and predictable order for the data being logged.

**Benefits of using `TreeMap`:**

*   **Sorted Keys:** The primary benefit is the sorted order. When the `detailInfo` map is converted to JSON using `Utils.toJSON()`, the JSON object will have its properties (keys) in sorted order. This can be useful for debugging, logging analysis, and potentially for comparing logs across different runs or environments.
*   **Readability:** Sorted output makes the logs more human-readable and easier to parse visually.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent order of properties in the JSON output, regardless of the order in which the properties were added to the map.

**Drawbacks of using `TreeMap` compared to `HashMap`:**

*   **Performance:** `TreeMap` has a higher overhead than `HashMap` for basic operations like `put` and `get`. This is because `TreeMap` maintains a sorted tree structure, which requires more computational effort. `HashMap` provides O(1) average-case performance for these operations, while `TreeMap` provides O(log n).
*   **Memory Usage:** `TreeMap` typically consumes more memory than `HashMap` due to the overhead of maintaining the tree structure.
*   **Unnecessary Sorting:** If the order of the properties in the JSON output is not important, the sorting provided by `TreeMap` is unnecessary overhead.

**In this specific context:**

The choice between `TreeMap` and `HashMap` depends on the requirements of the application. If the sorted order of the properties in the logs is important for readability or analysis, `TreeMap` is a good choice. However, if performance is critical and the order of the properties is not important, `HashMap` would be a better choice.

Given the context of logging startup information, the benefit of having a sorted log likely outweighs the performance cost. It improves the maintainability and debuggability of the application by providing a consistent and predictable log format.
