The `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method estimates the absolute humidity of air based on its temperature and relative humidity.

**Input Parameters:**

*   `temperature`:  A `double` representing the air temperature in Celsius (°C).  The expected range, as indicated by the Javadoc, is approximately -30°C to +35°C.
*   `relativeHumidity`: A `double` representing the relative humidity as a decimal fraction (e.g., 60% is represented as 0.6).  This is a dimensionless quantity, expressed as a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

**Return Value:**

The method returns a `double` representing the absolute humidity, expressed in grams of water per cubic meter of air (g/m³).

**Significance of the URL:**

The URL `https://carnotcycle.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/how-to-convert-relative-humidity-to-absolute-humidity/` provides the source and derivation of the formula used in the method.  It indicates that the formula offers an accuracy within 0.1% across the specified temperature range, lending credibility to the calculation.
