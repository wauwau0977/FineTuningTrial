Defining these as interface methods means that any class *implementing* `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` *must* provide concrete implementations for each of these getter methods.  This enforces a contract – any object claiming to be a `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` object is guaranteed to be able to provide values for `dayOfWeekStartingMonday`, `dayOfWeekText`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, and `numOfStatisticRecords1`. This promotes loose coupling and allows for different implementations of the interface without affecting code that uses it, as long as they adhere to the defined contract (the getter methods). This also enables polymorphism – you can treat different implementations of the interface uniformly through the interface type.
