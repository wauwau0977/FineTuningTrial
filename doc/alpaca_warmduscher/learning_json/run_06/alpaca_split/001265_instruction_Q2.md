For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java' with name 'MyStartUpListener.java'...
Assuming the `StartupData` class has a method called `reset()` that should be called before setting the startup time, modify the line `startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(timeTaken.toMillis());` to incorporate this functionality.
