`toBeTruthy()` is an assertion that verifies that a value is not considered "falsy" in JavaScript.  Falsy values include `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. 

In the context of the first test, it verifies that the `AppComponent` instance (`app`) was successfully created. If the component's constructor threw an error or if the instantiation process failed for any reason, `app` would be `undefined` or another falsy value, causing the test to fail. 

This test, while simple, is crucial because it catches fundamental initialization issues. It quickly confirms that the component can be created without crashing. It acts as a first line of defense against errors that might prevent the component from functioning at all.  Without this check, subsequent tests that rely on a valid component instance would likely fail in unpredictable ways, making debugging much harder.
