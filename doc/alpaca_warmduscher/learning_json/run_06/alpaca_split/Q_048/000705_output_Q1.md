Protecting sensitive location data within `MeteoSwissEntity` is paramount. Here’s how I’d approach security during the implementation of `getData()`:

1. **Data Masking/Redaction:** The most effective approach is to avoid exposing raw location data to unauthorized clients. I would implement data masking or redaction techniques:
    *   **Aggregation:** Instead of returning precise coordinates, aggregate location data to a coarser level of granularity (e.g., city, region).
    *   **Hashing/Encryption:** If precise coordinates are required, hash or encrypt the location data before returning it to the client. The client would need the appropriate key or decryption mechanism to access the original data.

2. **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
    *   **Authentication:** Verify the identity of the client making the request using a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys).
    *   **Authorization:** After authentication, determine whether the client has the necessary permissions to access the requested data.  This could involve role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).

3. **Data Encryption in Transit:** Ensure that all communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS) to protect data from eavesdropping.

4. **Data Encryption at Rest:** Consider encrypting the sensitive location data at rest in the database to protect it from unauthorized access in case of a database breach.

5. **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to `getData()` to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

6. **Audit Logging:** Log all access to sensitive data, including the client identity, timestamp, and data accessed. This will help with security monitoring and incident response.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each client. For example, if a client only needs to access temperature data, don't grant it access to location data.

8. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
