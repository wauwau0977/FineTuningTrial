The `convertUTCToSwitzerlandTime` method is designed to convert a `LocalDateTime` object representing a time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to its equivalent representation in Switzerland time (Europe/Zurich).

Here's a breakdown of the conversion process, step by step:

1.  **Null Check:** The method first checks if the input `dateTime` is null. If it is, the method immediately returns null, preventing a `NullPointerException`.
2.  **`atZone(ZoneId.of("UTC"))`:** This step associates the `LocalDateTime` object with the UTC time zone. This is important because the `LocalDateTime` object itself doesn't inherently store time zone information. The `atZone()` method effectively creates a `ZonedDateTime` object, which represents a specific point in time with a specific time zone.
3.  **`withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId.of("Europe/Zurich"))`:** This is the core of the conversion. It takes the `ZonedDateTime` object (representing the time in UTC) and converts it to a new `ZonedDateTime` object representing the same instant in time, but in the "Europe/Zurich" time zone. This effectively adjusts the time to account for the difference between UTC and Switzerland time.
4.  **`toLocalDateTime()`:** Finally, the method extracts the `LocalDateTime` object from the `ZonedDateTime` object in the "Europe/Zurich" time zone. This removes the time zone information and returns a `LocalDateTime` object representing the equivalent time in Switzerland.

In essence, the method takes a UTC time, associates it with the UTC time zone, then changes the time zone to Switzerland time while maintaining the same moment in time, and finally extracts the local date and time without the time zone information.
