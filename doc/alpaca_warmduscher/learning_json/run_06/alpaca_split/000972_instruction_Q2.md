For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java'... 
The interface defines `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg()`, `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMin()`, and `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMax()`. What are the potential implications of storing and processing these three separate values compared to, for example, storing only the raw data and calculating these values on demand?  Discuss the trade-offs in terms of storage, performance, and data integrity.
