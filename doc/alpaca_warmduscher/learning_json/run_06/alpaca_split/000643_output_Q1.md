If the `wrapperUrl` property contains a malicious URL, several issues could arise:

*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** The downloader could download a compromised version of the maven wrapper, leading to potential security vulnerabilities in the build process.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A malicious actor could redirect the download to a server they control, injecting malicious code.
*   **Denial of Service:** The malicious URL could point to a resource that is intentionally slow or unavailable, causing build failures.

To mitigate these risks, the following modifications could be implemented:

1.  **URL Validation:** Before downloading from the specified URL, the code should validate it to ensure it adheres to a safe and expected format. This can involve checking the protocol (only allow `https`), hostname (whitelist allowed domains), and path. Regular expressions can be used for pattern matching.
2.  **Certificate Pinning:** For enhanced security, implement certificate pinning to verify that the downloaded content is coming from a trusted server with a valid certificate.
3.  **Content Hashing:** After downloading the file, calculate a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the downloaded content and compare it against a known, trusted hash value. This verifies the integrity of the downloaded file.
4.  **Allowlist of URLs:** Ideally, limit the accepted `wrapperUrl` values to a predefined allowlist of trusted URLs. If a custom URL is provided, it should be compared against this list.
5.  **Sandboxing:** Consider running the download process in a sandboxed environment to limit its access to system resources.

Hereâ€™s an example of how URL validation could be added:

```java
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;

// ... inside the main method after reading the url ...

if (url != null) {
    try {
        URL parsedUrl = new URL(url);
        if (!parsedUrl.getProtocol().equals("https")) {
            System.err.println("ERROR: Only HTTPS URLs are allowed.");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        // Add hostname validation here, comparing against a whitelist
        // String allowedHostname = "repo.maven.apache.org"; // Example
        // if (!parsedUrl.getHost().equals(allowedHostname)) { ... }
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        System.err.println("ERROR: Invalid URL format: " + url);
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```
