For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/index.html' with name 'index.html' we have the following question: 

Explain the purpose of the CSS classes applied to the `<body>` tag: `class="mat-typography mat-app-background"`.  What roles do these classes likely play in the applicationâ€™s overall styling and theming? Be specific about what framework/library is likely being used, and how these classes would influence the rendering of the app.
