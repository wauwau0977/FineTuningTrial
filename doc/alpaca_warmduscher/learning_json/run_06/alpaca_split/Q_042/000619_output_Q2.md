I would modify the `serviceBaseURL` to `/api`.

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  serviceBaseURL: "/api",
  fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24,
  "buildTimestampClient": "v01-20220220-093352"
};
```

**Reasoning:**

The current `serviceBaseURL` of "." instructs the client to make requests relative to the current URL.  However, because the reverse proxy adds a prefix (`/api` in this example), the client would attempt to make requests to URLs like `/some-api-endpoint` instead of the expected `/api/some-api-endpoint`.

By setting `serviceBaseURL` to `/api`, we explicitly tell the client to prepend this prefix to all API requests. This ensures that the client correctly communicates with the backend services through the reverse proxy, handling SSL termination and routing correctly.  This avoids broken API calls and ensures the application functions as intended behind the proxy.
