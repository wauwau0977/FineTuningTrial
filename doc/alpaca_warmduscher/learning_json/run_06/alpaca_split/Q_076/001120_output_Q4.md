```java
new Authenticator() {
    @Override
    protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
        return new PasswordAuthentication(mailSender, mailPassword);
    }
}
```

The `Authenticator` class is a crucial component for securing the connection to the SMTP server. It's an abstract class from the `javax.mail` package thatâ€™s extended to provide authentication credentials.  The purpose of extending this class is to customize how authentication is handled when connecting to the mail server.

In the `send` method, an anonymous inner class is created that extends `Authenticator`.  This allows us to override the `getPasswordAuthentication()` method.

The `getPasswordAuthentication()` method is the core of the authentication process. It is called by the `Session` object when the connection to the SMTP server needs to be authenticated. Inside this method, a `PasswordAuthentication` object is created and returned.  This object encapsulates the username (the `mailSender`, which is the email address sending the mail) and the password (`mailPassword`) needed to authenticate with the SMTP server.

The `Session` object then uses the `PasswordAuthentication` object to establish a secure connection and verify the identity of the sender.  Without providing these credentials, the SMTP server would reject the connection or refuse to send the email.  The use of `Authenticator` and `PasswordAuthentication` ensures that the email is sent from a legitimate source and prevents unauthorized access.
