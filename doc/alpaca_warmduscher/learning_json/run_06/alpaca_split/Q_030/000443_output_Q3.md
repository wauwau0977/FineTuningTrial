`shareReplay(1)` is a crucial operator for the proper functioning of this cache.  It transforms the `Observable` returned by `loader()` into a shared `Observable` that replays the last emitted value to any new subscriber.

The problem it solves is related to how Observables work: each subscriber typically triggers the underlying observable to execute. Without `shareReplay`, if multiple components requested the same cached data concurrently (or shortly after each other), `loader()` would be called multiple times, defeating the purpose of caching.

`shareReplay(1)` ensures that the `loader()` function is only called *once* for each unique `cacheKey`. The first subscriber receives the data, and `shareReplay(1)` caches the last emitted value. Subsequent subscribers (i.e., other components requesting the same data) receive that cached value *without* triggering another call to `loader()`. The `1` indicates that only the *last* emitted value is replayed.  This efficiently handles multiple requests for the same data, significantly reducing network load and improving application performance.  Effectively, it turns the cold `Observable` from `loader()` into a warm, cached stream.
