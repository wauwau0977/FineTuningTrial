Several mechanisms can be employed to dynamically replace the value of `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` during the build process:

1.  **Environment Variables:** This is the most common and recommended approach. The CI/CD pipeline can set an environment variable (e.g., `FULL_PAGE_REFRESH_SECONDS`) before running the build process.  The build script (e.g., using a pre-build script in `package.json` or a build tool configuration) would then read this environment variable and replace the `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` value in the `environment.prod.ts` file.

    ```bash
    # Example in package.json (pre-build script)
    "scripts": {
      "prebuild": "node -e \"process.env.FULL_PAGE_REFRESH_SECONDS && console.log('FULL_PAGE_REFRESH_SECONDS', process.env.FULL_PAGE_REFRESH_SECONDS)\""
    }
    ```

2.  **Build Tool Configuration (Webpack, Angular CLI):**  Most build tools allow you to define variables or placeholders that are replaced during the build process. You can configure the build tool to read an environment variable or a configuration file and use its value to replace the `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` value.

3.  **Templating (e.g., `sed`, `replace`):**  A script could use a command-line tool like `sed` or `replace` to find and replace the value of `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` in the `environment.prod.ts` file.

**Why it's desirable:**

*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Different environments (development, staging, production) may require different refresh intervals. Dynamically replacing the value allows you to easily configure the application for each environment without modifying the code.  Production may need a longer refresh interval than development.
*   **Flexibility and Control:**  It provides a way to control the refresh interval without requiring a code change and redeployment.
*   **CI/CD Automation:**  It enables full automation of the configuration process within the CI/CD pipeline.

Using environment variables is generally the preferred approach due to its simplicity, portability, and compatibility with most CI/CD systems.
