For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UUIDUtils.java' with name 'UUIDUtils.java'... 
In the `generateShortTextUUID()` method, what problem is being addressed by the conditional logic that adds characters from another UUID when the generated short text is shorter than `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE`? Explain why simply padding with standard Base58 characters might not be sufficient.
