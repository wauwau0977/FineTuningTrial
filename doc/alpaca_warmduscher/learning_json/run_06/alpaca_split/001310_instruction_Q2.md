For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/DateTimeConfig.java' with name 'DateTimeConfig.java'... 
The code contains a commented-out `@Bean` definition for `jsonCustomizer()`. Explain what this bean is intended to do, and why it might be used in conjunction with the `FormattingConversionService` configuration. What is the difference between configuring date/time formats through the `FormattingConversionService` and configuring them via a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer`?
