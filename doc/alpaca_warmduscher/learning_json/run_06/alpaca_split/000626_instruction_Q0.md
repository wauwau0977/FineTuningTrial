You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This file, `environment.ts`, defines configuration settings for the Warmduscher application, specifically for the development environment. It primarily defines the base URL for the backend service (`serviceBaseURL`), a refresh interval for full page updates (`fullPageRefreshInSeconds`), and a build timestamp (`buildTimestampClient`). It also includes a commented-out import statement for debugging purposes related to zone error handling in Angular.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts`
- **Class Name(s):**  None. This file is a TypeScript module containing constants, not a class definition.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Provides configuration values for the Warmduscher application, allowing developers to easily switch between environments (e.g., development, production) by modifying these values.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: No direct user inputs. The file serves as an input to the application during build and runtime. The outputs are the configuration values used by the application.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The file directly exposes constant values.  There is no dynamic logic or workflow within the file itself.  The values are read by the application during initialization.
- **External Interactions**: None. This file does not interact with external systems or services directly. It provides configuration *to* the application which then interacts with external resources.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  No specific edge case handling is present. However, incorrect configuration values (e.g., an invalid `serviceBaseURL`) could lead to application errors, which would be handled by the application code itself.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The file is small and has minimal impact on application performance. Accessing constants is a very fast operation.
- **Scalability**: The file does not directly affect scalability.
- **Security**: The `serviceBaseURL` should be configured to use HTTPS in production to ensure secure communication with the backend service.  This file itself doesn't implement security, but influences it via the base URL.
- **Maintainability**: The file is simple and easy to maintain.  Configuration values are clearly defined.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The file is a static asset and therefore has high reliability and availability.
- **Usability**: The file provides a clear and centralized location for configuration values, making it easy to manage and modify them.
- **Compliance**: The configuration values should adhere to any relevant security or data privacy regulations (e.g., ensuring HTTPS is used for sensitive data).

## 5. Key Components

- **`environment` object:** This object contains the configuration constants:
    - `production`: Boolean indicating whether the application is running in production mode.
    - `serviceBaseURL`: String specifying the base URL for the backend service.
    - `fullPageRefreshInSeconds`: Number representing the interval (in seconds) for full page refreshes.
    - `buildTimestampClient`: String indicating the timestamp of the client build.
- **Error Handling**:  None directly within the file.
- **Classes:** None.
- **Modules**:  This file defines a TypeScript module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript Constants:**  The file utilizes TypeScript constants for defining configuration values.
- **TypeScript Object Literal**: The file uses an object literal to group configuration values.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular CLI:** The Angular CLI uses this file during the build process for environment-specific configurations.  It replaces this file with `environment.prod.ts` in production builds.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.  This file is self-contained and does not depend on any other internal project modules.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Configuration Management:** Consider using a more robust configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) for managing different environments and configurations. This could improve security and maintainability.
- **Validation:** Add validation to the configuration values to ensure they are valid and meet the application's requirements.  This could prevent runtime errors.
- **Dynamic Configuration**:  In a more complex application, explore the possibility of loading configuration values dynamically from a remote source, allowing for runtime configuration changes without requiring a rebuild.
- **Security Considerations**: For sensitive data, store configuration values securely and avoid hardcoding them directly into the file.  Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration store.
