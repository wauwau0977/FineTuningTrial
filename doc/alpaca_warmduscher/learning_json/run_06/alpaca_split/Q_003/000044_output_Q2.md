The loading order is critical because Zone.js patches existing JavaScript functions and objects when it loads. These patches modify the behavior of those functions to enable Zone.js’s features, like tracking asynchronous operations. 

If you try to set a flag *after* `zone.js` has loaded, it's too late. The functions have already been patched, and the flag won’t have any effect. Zone.js doesn’t have a mechanism to unpatch or re-apply patches dynamically.

Therefore, the flags must be set *before* `zone.js` loads to prevent the specific patching from occurring in the first place. The flags essentially tell Zone.js *not* to apply certain patches when it initializes. The documentation's emphasis on loading order ensures that these configuration options are respected and take effect correctly. This is why the code encourages placing the flag configuration in a separate `zone-flags.ts` file, which is then imported *before* `zone.js`.
