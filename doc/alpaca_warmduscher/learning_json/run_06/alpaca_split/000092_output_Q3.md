`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` is a crucial part of setting up Angular's routing system.  It's used to initialize the router and provide the application-level routing configuration. 

Specifically, `forRoot()`:

1. **Initializes the Router Service:** It creates a singleton instance of the `Router` service, which manages navigation within the application.
2. **Configures Routes:** It takes the `routes` array (which in this case is empty) as input and uses this array to define the application's possible navigation paths.  The router uses this configuration to match URLs to corresponding components.
3. **Creates Router Outlets:**  It sets up the `<router-outlet>` directives in the application's templates, which are placeholders where the router will render the appropriate component based on the current route.
4. **Provides Router Directives:** It provides essential directives like `routerLink` and `router-outlet` that are used in templates to create navigation links and display routed content.

Itâ€™s used *within* `@NgModule` because the routing module needs to be declared as a module so Angular can correctly load and configure the routing functionality as part of the application bootstrapping process. `forRoot()` should only be called once in the *root* routing module (typically `AppRoutingModule`); subsequent modules that extend the routing configuration should use `RouterModule.forChild(routes)`.
