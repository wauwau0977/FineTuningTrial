For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/ThException.java' with name 'ThException.java'... 
Why does this class extend `RuntimeException` rather than `Exception`? What are the implications of this design choice in terms of how calling code would handle instances of `ThException`?
