For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass' with name 'styles.sass'... 
Consider the following code:
```sass
mat-card
  border-color: white
  border-width: 1px
  margin: 12px 3px
```
What is the purpose of these styles? If you were to refactor this code for better maintainability, how might you approach it, considering the possibility of needing to apply different card styles throughout the application?
