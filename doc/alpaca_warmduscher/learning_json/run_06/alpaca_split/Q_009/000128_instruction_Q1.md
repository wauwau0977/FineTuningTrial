For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.spec.ts' with name 'app.component.spec.ts'...  How does the use of `toBeTruthy()` in the first test ('should create the app') contribute to the overall quality of the test suite, and what kind of issue would it likely detect?
