For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadService.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadService.java'... 

The `getData()` method reads a variety of registers from the Modbus device.  Consider the following snippet from that method:

```java
ret.setIreg300TempOutdoor(readInputRegister(modbusMaster, 300, true, 10)); // outdoor temp
```

Explain the purpose of the arguments `300`, `true`, and `10` in the call to `readInputRegister`.  What potential issues might arise from hardcoding these values directly in the `getData()` method and how might these be addressed?
