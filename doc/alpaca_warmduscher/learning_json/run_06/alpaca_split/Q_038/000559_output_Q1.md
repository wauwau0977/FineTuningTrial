The commented-out line `<!--<app-overview-current-gauge></app-overview-current-gauge>-->` indicates that a component named `app-overview-current-gauge` was at one point intended to be included in this view, but has since been removed from the active layout.

Benefits of having the line *even when commented out*:

*   **Documentation/History:** It serves as documentation for future developers, indicating that this component was considered or previously used. It provides context for why the code might have been written that way.
*   **Easy Re-enablement:**  It allows the component to be easily re-enabled in the future by simply removing the comment tags.  This is faster than re-implementing the componentâ€™s inclusion from scratch.

Drawbacks:

*   **Code Clutter:**  Commented-out code adds to the overall code size and can make it more difficult to read and maintain.
*   **Potential Confusion:**  It might mislead developers into thinking the component is still relevant or necessary.

Reasons it might have been commented out:

*   **Redundancy:** The gauge might have been deemed redundant with the chart or other temperature displays.
*   **Usability Issues:**  The gauge might have not provided a good user experience or been difficult to interpret.
*   **Bugs or Errors:** The gauge component itself might have had bugs or errors that needed to be resolved.
*   **Feature Removal:** The gauge might have been part of a feature that was removed or simplified during development.
*   **A/B testing/Experimentation**: It might have been used during an A/B test to determine whether a gauge or chart was preferable for the user experience, and the gauge was ultimately removed.
