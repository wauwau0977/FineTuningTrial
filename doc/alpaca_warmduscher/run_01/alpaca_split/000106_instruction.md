You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component is an HTML file (`about.component.html`) displaying informational content about the 'Warmduscher' project. It presents a series of `mat-card` elements, each detailing a specific aspect of the system - from the hardware used (Raspberry Pi, Heat Pump) to the software architecture (Java/Spring Boot server, Angular UI) and communication protocols (Modbus). The component also includes a video demonstrating how to install the application as a Progressive Web App (PWA). It’s primarily a static presentation layer designed to inform users about the underlying technology and setup of the system.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.html`
- **Class Name(s):**  None – this is an HTML template and does not define classes. However, it utilizes Angular Material components like `mat-card`, `mat-card-header`, `mat-card-title`, and `mat-card-content`.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** The component displays static informational content about the Warmduscher project.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Input:** The component receives data via Angular's data binding mechanism. Specifically, the `buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer` variables are bound to values provided by the associated Angular component.
    - **Output:** The component displays a series of `mat-card` elements containing images, text, and a video, presenting information about the project's hardware and software.
- **Workflow/Logic:**  The component renders the HTML elements in a predefined order. The content within each `mat-card` is static, but the `buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer` variables are dynamically updated, indicating build dates.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Asset Loading:**  Loads images from the `assets/images/` directory and a video from `assets/videos/`.
    - **Video Playback:** Uses the HTML5 `<video>` tag to play the `Install_PWA_Android.mp4` video.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - **Video Support:** The component provides fallback text if the browser doesn’t support the HTML5 `<video>` tag.
    - **Missing Assets:**  If images or the video are missing, the browser will display a broken image icon or an error message, respectively. The application itself does not have explicit handling for this case beyond the default browser behaviour.
    - **Dynamic Data:** If the `buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer` values are not provided, those placeholders will be rendered as empty or undefined.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The component should render quickly as it mainly consists of static content. Image optimization and video encoding are important.
- **Scalability:** Not applicable. This is a static view, not a server-side component.
- **Security:**  Not directly applicable. The component doesn't handle user input or sensitive data. However, ensure the web server serving the assets is secure.
- **Maintainability:** The HTML is relatively well-structured with clear `mat-card` elements.  Adding or modifying content should be straightforward.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The component is reliable as it's static content. Availability depends on the web server serving the assets.
- **Usability:** The presentation is visually appealing and informative, making it easy for users to understand the project’s architecture.
- **Compliance:** Ensure all images and videos are appropriately licensed.

## 5. Key Components

- **`mat-card`:** Container for each section of information.
- **`mat-card-header`:** Header section of each card, containing the title.
- **`mat-card-title`:**  Title of each section.
- **`mat-card-content`:** Main content area within each card.
- **`img`:** Displays images related to the project.
- **`<video>`:**  Embeds and plays the PWA installation video.
- **`buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer`:** Angular data binding placeholders for build timestamps.

Important logic flows: The content is statically arranged; there are no dynamic logic flows.

Error handling: Basic fallback text for video tag.

Classes: None – this is HTML.

Modules: Angular Material, HTML5 Video.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- HTML5: Basic structure and semantics.
- CSS: Styling and layout.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular Material:** Provides the `mat-card`, `mat-card-header`, `mat-card-title`, `mat-card-content` components for creating a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
- **HTML5 Video API:** Used for embedding and playing the video.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- Images & Videos in the `assets` directory.
- Angular component that provides `buildTimestampClient` and `buildTimestampServer` data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Optimize images and video encoding for faster loading times. Implement lazy loading for images below the fold.
- **Code Readability:** While generally well-structured, consider using CSS classes for consistent styling and more concise HTML.
- **Security Improvements:**  Ensure the web server hosting the assets is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Not applicable as it is a static component.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the layout is fully responsive across different screen sizes and devices using Angular's flex-layout or similar techniques.
- **Accessibility:** Add `alt` attributes to all images for screen readers and ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
