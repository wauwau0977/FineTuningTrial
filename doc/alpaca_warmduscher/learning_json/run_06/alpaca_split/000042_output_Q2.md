"Evergreen" browsers are those that receive automatic, frequent updates.  Examples include the latest versions of Safari, Chrome (including Opera), Edge, and Chrome on mobile (Android/iOS). These browsers consistently implement modern web standards and features without requiring major version upgrades from the user. The defining characteristic is automatic updates to the latest version.

This distinction is *crucially* important when deciding what polyfills to include. Polyfills are code that provides modern functionality in older browsers that don't yet support it natively.  If the target audience primarily uses evergreen browsers, the need for many polyfills is significantly reduced.  Adding unnecessary polyfills can increase the application's bundle size, slowing down load times and negatively impacting performance.

The file's focus on evergreen browsers means that the polyfills included should only address gaps in *very* old or unusual browser versions that might still be encountered, or to support specific, advanced features that are not yet universally implemented. The goal is to maintain a lean and efficient codebase, relying on the browser's native capabilities whenever possible.
