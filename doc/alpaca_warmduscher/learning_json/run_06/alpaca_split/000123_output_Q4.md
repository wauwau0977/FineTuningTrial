The `.toolbarText` class defines styling for text within the toolbar. It sets the `line-height` to `24px` and the `margin-bottom` to `8px`.  The `line-height` controls the spacing between lines of text, while the `margin-bottom` adds spacing below the text, visually separating it from any elements that follow.  This class is likely intended to format labels or descriptions associated with toolbar buttons or icons.
