The `path: '**'` route is a wildcard route. It acts as a catch-all for any route that doesn't match any of the other defined routes. In this case, if the user navigates to a URL that doesn't correspond to '/dashboard', '/insights', or '/about', the application will redirect them to '/dashboard'.  This is effectively a "404 Not Found" handling mechanism in Angular routing, preventing the user from seeing a blank page or an error. It differs from the other routes because it doesn't match a specific path; it matches *any* path, making it the last route that should be defined in the `routes` array to ensure it doesn't inadvertently override the other, more specific routes.
