Both `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` and `findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats` retrieve `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity` data within a defined date range, but they differ significantly in how they group the data and limit the results.

**`findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats`:**

*   **Grouping:**  This method doesn't group the data by any time interval. Instead, it retrieves all records within the date range and then applies a simple `LIMIT` clause (`:maxRows`).
*   **Limiting:** It limits the *number of rows* returned based on the `maxRows` parameter.  There is no time-based aggregation. It simply fetches the first `maxRows` records it encounters within the specified date range.
*   **Behavior:** It retrieves raw data up to the specified limit, without summarizing or aggregating data over time intervals.

**`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`:**

*   **Grouping:** This method groups the data by fixed time intervals. It uses `round(extract(epoch from measurement_date) / :group_every_nth_second)` to divide the time range into segments. It then calculates statistics (like average, min, max) *for each of these intervals*.
*   **Limiting:** The limiting isn't explicitly a row limit. The number of results is implicitly limited by the number of time intervals created by `:group_every_nth_second` within the date range.  Essentially, it returns one `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity` record *per time interval* that falls within the date range.
*   **Behavior:** It performs time-series aggregation, summarizing data over fixed intervals. It doesn't return individual raw records but rather aggregated statistics for each interval.

**In summary:** `findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats` retrieves a limited number of raw records, while `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` aggregates data into fixed time intervals and returns one record per interval.
