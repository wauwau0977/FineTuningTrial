For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Physics.java' with name 'Physics.java' we have the following question: 
Modify the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method to include input validation.  Specifically, ensure that the `temperature` parameter is within the range of -50°C to +50°C and that the `relativeHumidity` parameter is between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). If either parameter is outside these valid ranges, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a descriptive message indicating which parameter is invalid. Do not change the return type or the method signature, and retain the existing Javadoc comment.
