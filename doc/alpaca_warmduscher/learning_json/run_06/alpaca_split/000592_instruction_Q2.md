For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.spec.ts'... 
Suppose you need to test a method within `OverviewCurrentComponent` called `updateTitle(newTitle: string)`. This method is intended to change the componentâ€™s `title` property. How would you test that calling `updateTitle` with a specific value correctly updates the component's `title` property?
