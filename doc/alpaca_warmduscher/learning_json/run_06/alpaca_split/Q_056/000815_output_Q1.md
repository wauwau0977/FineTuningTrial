The `<SessionRequest, String>` generic types define the entity type and the type of its primary key, respectively.

*   `SessionRequest`:  This represents the entity class that the repository manages. It specifies the type of object that will be stored and retrieved from the database.
*   `String`: This specifies the data type of the primary key for the `SessionRequest` entity. In this case, the primary key is a `String`.

If the primary key of the `SessionRequest` entity was an `Integer` instead of a `String`, you would need to change the second generic type in the `CrudRepository` interface definition to `Integer`.  The interface would then become:

```java
public interface SessionRequestRepository extends CrudRepository<SessionRequest, Integer> {
}
```

This change is crucial because Spring Data JPA needs to know the type of the primary key to correctly map database records to entity objects and to generate appropriate queries for fetching and saving data.  Failing to update the generic type would lead to runtime errors or incorrect data access. Also, the corresponding `id` field in `SessionRequest` entity should be an Integer.
