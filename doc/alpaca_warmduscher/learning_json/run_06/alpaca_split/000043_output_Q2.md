Zone.js is a JavaScript library that provides a context for asynchronous operations and enables efficient change detection in Angular applications. It essentially intercepts and monitors asynchronous tasks like timers, event listeners, and XHR requests. 

Within Angular, Zone.js creates "zones" – execution contexts where it can hook into asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous task completes within a Zone, it triggers Angular’s change detection mechanism.  This means that when data changes as a result of an asynchronous operation (e.g., a server response), Angular automatically detects these changes and updates the DOM accordingly. 

Without Zone.js, Angular would need to manually poll for changes, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. Zone.js provides a more performant and reactive approach, enabling Angular to respond to changes in a timely and efficient manner, resulting in a smoother user experience.  It’s considered essential because it’s the foundation for Angular’s reactivity and data binding system.
