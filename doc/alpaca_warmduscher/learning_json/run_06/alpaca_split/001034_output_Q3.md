The `@Scheduled` annotation indicates that the `pollData` method should be executed on a schedule managed by Spring's scheduling mechanism. This allows the method to be executed periodically without requiring explicit threading or timers in the code.

The `fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}"` configuration determines the interval at which the method is executed. It reads the value of the `thserver.pollingInterval` property from the application's configuration (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`).  The value is expressed in ISO 8601 duration format.  If the `thserver.pollingInterval` property is not found in the configuration, it defaults to `PT60s`, which means the method will be executed every 60 seconds.

`initialDelay = 0` signifies that the method should be executed immediately after the application context is fully initialized, without any initial delay.  A value greater than 0 would introduce a delay before the first execution of the scheduled task.
