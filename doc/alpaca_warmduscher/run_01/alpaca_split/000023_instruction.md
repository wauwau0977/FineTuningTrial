You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the `UnsafeRunnable` interface. It’s a functional interface designed to represent a Runnable whose `run()` method can throw checked exceptions. This allows for more flexible exception handling in scenarios where a standard `Runnable`'s restriction against throwing checked exceptions is undesirable.  It's a utility interface to facilitate exception propagation from within Runnable implementations.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java
- **Class Name(s):** `UnsafeRunnable`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Defines a functional interface for a Runnable that allows checked exceptions to be thrown.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This interface doesn’t have direct user inputs or outputs. It's a contract for classes that *implement* it.  The implementations will define the input/output behavior.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The interface declares a single method, `run()`, which accepts no arguments and can throw any `Exception`.
- **External Interactions**: No external interactions directly within the interface definition.  Implementations might interact with external resources.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The interface inherently handles the edge case of checked exceptions. Without it, checked exceptions within a standard `Runnable` would require a `try-catch` block within the calling code.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Negligible impact on performance as it's merely an interface definition.
- **Scalability**: No impact on scalability.
- **Security**: No direct security implications. Security is dependent on the implementation.
- **Maintainability**: Highly maintainable due to its simplicity and clear purpose.
- **Reliability & Availability**: No impact on reliability or availability.
- **Usability**: Increases usability by allowing for more natural exception handling in Runnable implementations.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `void run() throws Exception;`: This is the core method of the interface. It represents the task to be executed and allows any exception to be thrown.
- **Important logic flows**:  No inherent logic flow within the interface. The logic is defined in the implementing class.
- **Error handling**: The interface allows exceptions to propagate, enabling the caller to handle them.
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined as it is an interface.
- **Modules**: This interface is part of the `thserver` module of the `Warmduscher` project.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Functional Interfaces
- Exception Handling

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Generics**:  Could be extended to support generics if a specific return type from the `run()` method is required. However, the current design prioritizes simplicity.
- **Documentation**: Although simple, comprehensive Javadoc documentation would be beneficial to clearly explain the purpose and usage of the interface.
- **Consideration of Alternatives**: Evaluate whether a standard `try-catch` block within the `run()` method of a standard `Runnable` is sufficient for the use case. This interface adds a layer of complexity that might not always be necessary.
