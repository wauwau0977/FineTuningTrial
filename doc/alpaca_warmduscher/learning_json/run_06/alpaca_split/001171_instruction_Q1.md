For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java'... Assume `UnsafeRunnable` is a custom interface defined elsewhere as `public interface UnsafeRunnable { void run() throws Exception; }`. How does this interface interact with the `execute` method designed for it, and what potential issues could arise from defining an interface that explicitly allows throwing checked exceptions, but then immediately catching them within the utility?
