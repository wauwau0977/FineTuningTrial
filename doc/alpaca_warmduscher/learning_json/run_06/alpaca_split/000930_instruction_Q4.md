For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionRequest.java' with name 'SessionRequest.java' we have the following question:
Explain the purpose of the various `@Index` annotations used in the `SessionRequest` class. Specifically, describe what database indexing is, why it's important, and how each of these indexes is intended to improve query performance. What kind of queries would benefit from each index?
