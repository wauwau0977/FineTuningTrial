You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a REST controller (`InfoService`) that provides information about the system. It exposes two endpoints: `/info/general` which returns general system information stored in an `InfoBean`, and `/info/memory` which returns current system memory information obtained from a static method `getCurrent()` of the `MemoryInfo` class.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/InfoService.java
- **Class Name(s):** `InfoService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code provides REST endpoints for retrieving system information.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - `/info/general`: No input required. Output: An `InfoBean` object containing general information.
    - `/info/memory`: No input required. Output: A `MemoryInfo` object representing current memory statistics.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - A client requests either `/info/general` or `/info/memory`.
    - For `/info/general`, the `getInfo()` method returns the pre-configured `InfoBean` object.
    - For `/info/memory`, the `getMemoryInfo()` method calls the static method `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` to retrieve and return the current memory information.
- **External Interactions**: None beyond the HTTP request/response cycle. It does not interact with databases, files, or other external services directly.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The code does not include specific error handling.  If `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` throws an exception, it will propagate up the call stack.  A missing or invalid `InfoBean` during the construction of `InfoService` will lead to a `NullPointerException` when the `/info/general` endpoint is accessed.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The response time is expected to be very fast as the operation involves only returning pre-existing data or the result of a static method call.
- **Scalability**: The code itself is not a scaling bottleneck. Scalability depends on the underlying infrastructure and the ability to handle concurrent requests.
- **Security**: No specific security measures are implemented within this class. Access control should be handled by the web server or a security framework.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. The use of dependency injection (constructor injection of `InfoBean`) promotes testability and loose coupling.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class is reliable as long as the `InfoBean` is properly initialized and `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` is stable.
- **Usability**: The REST endpoints are straightforward to use.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are stated.

## 5. Key Components

- **`InfoService` class**: REST controller responsible for handling information requests.
- **`getInfo()` method**: Returns the `InfoBean` object.
- **`getMemoryInfo()` method**: Returns a `MemoryInfo` object representing system memory statistics.
- **`InfoBean` class**:  (Not shown, but assumed) A bean class holding general system information.
- **`MemoryInfo` class**: (Not shown, but assumed) A class responsible for retrieving system memory information.  The `getCurrent()` method is static.
- **Error Handling**:  Implicit exception propagation.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Java Collections (potentially within `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo` but not directly used in `InfoService`)
- Standard HTTP classes (via Spring Web)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection (constructor injection of `InfoBean`), REST controller annotation (`@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, `@ResponseBody`).
- **Spring Web**: Provides the infrastructure for handling web requests and responses.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.InfoBean`**: A custom bean class holding general system information.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.MemoryInfo`**:  A custom class providing memory information.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**:  Caching of `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` results could reduce overhead if memory statistics are frequently requested.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the endpoints.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Consider using a more scalable memory information gathering mechanism if the application is expected to handle a very large number of requests.  The static method `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` could become a bottleneck.
- **Error Handling**: Add explicit error handling and logging to gracefully handle exceptions.  Return appropriate HTTP error codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) if an exception occurs.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of the controller.
