The purpose of `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)` is likely to exclude certain types of requests from being saved to the `SessionRequest` repository.  This is a common practice to reduce storage costs, minimize logging noise, and improve performance.

Types of requests that might be excluded include:

* **Static Resource Requests:**  Requests for images, CSS files, JavaScript files, or other static assets. These requests don't typically require detailed monitoring or analysis.
* **Health Check Endpoints:**  Endpoints used for monitoring the application's health and availability.
* **Heartbeat Requests:**  Requests used for keeping connections alive.
* **Certain API Endpoints:**  Perhaps requests to endpoints that don't represent core business logic, or that are considered low-priority for monitoring.
* **Internal Requests:** Requests originating from within the application itself, rather than from external clients.

Trade-offs of filtering requests:

* **Reduced Monitoring Coverage:** Filtering requests means that some potentially valuable information is not being logged or analyzed. This could make it more difficult to diagnose issues or identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Complexity:** Implementing and maintaining the filtering logic adds complexity to the application.
* **Potential for Errors:** If the filtering logic is not implemented correctly, it could accidentally exclude important requests or include irrelevant ones.
* **Data Skew:** Filtering may cause the data stored to be unrepresentative of the traffic that the system is actually serving.

However, these trade-offs are often outweighed by the benefits of reducing storage costs, improving performance, and minimizing logging noise. The key is to carefully consider which requests should be excluded and to ensure that the filtering logic is implemented correctly.
