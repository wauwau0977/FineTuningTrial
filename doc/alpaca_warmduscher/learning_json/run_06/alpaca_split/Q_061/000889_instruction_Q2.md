For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java'... 
Consider the following getter methods: `getBoilerTempMin()`, `getHeatingOutMax()`, `getSoleInMin()`.  What design pattern is hinted at by this naming convention and the presence of both regular and 'Min/Max' getters? How might this pattern be useful in the context of heat pump statistics?
