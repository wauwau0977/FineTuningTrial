For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UUIDUtils.java' with name 'UUIDUtils.java'... 
The `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` constant is defined as 22. If this value were to change to, say, 15, what impact would this have on the uniqueness of the generated short text UUIDs (generated via `generateShortTextUUID()`) and what considerations would you make?
