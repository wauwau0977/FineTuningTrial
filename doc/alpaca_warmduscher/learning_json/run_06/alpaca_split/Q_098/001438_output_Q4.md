The `toString()` method in the `InfoBean` class is overridden from the `Object` class to provide a string representation of the object's state. This is primarily useful for debugging and logging purposes.

It constructs a string that includes the values of the `deviceName`, `buildTimestampServer`, and `buildVersionServer` fields, formatted in a readable way. The string begins with "InfoBean{" and each field is represented as "fieldName='fieldValue'". Fields are separated by commas, and the string ends with "}".

Here's the exact code:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "InfoBean{" +
            "deviceName='" + deviceName + '\'' +
            ", buildTimestampServer='" + buildTimestampServer + '\'' +
            ", buildVersionServer='" + buildVersionServer + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```
