These methods are defined as getter methods, signifying that the interface represents a data holder, and these methods provide read-only access to the respective statistics. This suggests that the actual implementation of `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity` (likely a class) will contain private or package-private fields to store the values for boiler temperature, compressor hours, and various temperature inputs/outputs (heating, sole). The interface forces any implementing class to *provide* a way to retrieve these values, allowing for consistent access without exposing the internal storage mechanisms. This is a fundamental principle of encapsulation and promotes loose coupling in the application. The use of `Double` and `Integer` types suggests these are numerical measurements collected from the heat pump system.
