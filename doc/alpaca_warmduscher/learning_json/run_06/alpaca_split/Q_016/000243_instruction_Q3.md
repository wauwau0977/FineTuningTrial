For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts' with name 'my-http-interceptor.service.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...

```typescript
constructor(private clientIdService: ClientIdService) {
 }
```

What is the purpose of dependency injection used in the constructor of the `MyHttpInterceptor` service, and why is `ClientIdService` injected?
