Using named constants like `DEFAULT` and `SENSOR_MOCK` offers several benefits compared to hardcoding string literals directly into the application's logic:

*   **Readability and Maintainability:**  Constants make the code more self-documenting.  `Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK` clearly communicates the *meaning* of the string "sensormock" in a way that just `"sensormock"` does not. If the value needs to be changed (e.g., to `"mock"`), it only needs to be changed in *one* place—the constant declaration—instead of throughout the codebase.
*   **Reduced Errors:**  Hardcoding string literals increases the risk of typos or inconsistencies.  If a string literal is misspelled in one place and not in another, it can lead to subtle bugs. Using constants ensures consistency.
*   **Centralized Configuration:**  Constants provide a centralized place to manage configuration values.  This makes it easier to understand and modify the application's behavior.
*   **Refactoring Support:** If the application’s logic needs to change (e.g., the way profiles are identified), it is easier to modify the constant declaration than to search and replace all occurrences of the literal string.
*   **Testability:** Using constants makes it easier to write unit tests, as you can use the constant names to assert expected values.

In essence, using constants improves code quality, reduces the risk of errors, and makes the application more maintainable and easier to understand. They are a fundamental principle of good software development.
