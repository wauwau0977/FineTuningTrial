The `getHeatPumpMeasurements` method should utilize a database query that leverages the `measurement_date_start`, `measurement_date_end`, and `group_every_nth_second` parameters for efficient data retrieval and aggregation. Here's a breakdown of the implementation strategy:

1.  **Query Construction:** The core of the implementation involves constructing a native SQL query or utilizing a JPA/Hibernate equivalent. The query should:
    *   Select the necessary data (temperature, humidity, timestamps, etc.).
    *   Filter the results based on the `measurement_date_start` and `measurement_date_end`.  Using parameterized queries is crucial to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Group the results by a calculated interval based on `group_every_nth_second`. This can be achieved using database-specific functions like `FLOOR(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp) / group_every_nth_second)` in MySQL or `TRUNC(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp) / group_every_nth_second)` in PostgreSQL.  The specific function will depend on the database being used.
    *   Aggregate the grouped data using functions like `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, or `COUNT()` as needed to produce the desired output.

2.  **Database-Specific Optimizations:**
    *   **Indexing:** Ensure that the `timestamp` column is properly indexed to accelerate filtering by date range.
    *   **Partitioning:** If the table is large, consider partitioning it by date to further improve query performance.
    *   **Query Hints:** Depending on the database, you might be able to use query hints to guide the query optimizer and improve execution plans.
    *   **Native SQL vs. JPA/Hibernate:**  For complex aggregations like this, using native SQL queries can sometimes be more efficient than relying on JPA/Hibernate's query generation, as you have finer control over the generated SQL.

3.  **Implementation Example (Conceptual - using Spring Data JPA with Native Query):**

```java
@Repository
public interface HeatPumpRepository extends JpaRepository<HeatPumpMeasurement, Long> {

    @Query(value =
            "SELECT " +
            "   DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') as grouped_time, " + //Adapt for your DB
            "   AVG(temperature) as avg_temperature, " +
            "   AVG(humidity) as avg_humidity " +
            "FROM heat_pump_measurements " +
            "WHERE timestamp BETWEEN :measurementDateStart AND :measurementDateEnd " +
            "GROUP BY FLOOR(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp) / :groupEveryNthSecond) " +
            "ORDER BY timestamp " +
            "LIMIT :maxRows",
            nativeQuery = true)
    List<Object[]> getHeatPumpMeasurements(
            @Param(value = "measurement_date_start") Date measurementDateStart,
            @Param(value = "measurement_date_end") Date measurementDateEnd,
            @Param(value = "maxRows") int maxRows,
            @Param(value = "group_every_nth_second") int groupEveryNthSecond
    );
}
```

4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch potential exceptions during database interaction, such as invalid parameters or connection errors.

5.  **Data Transfer Object (DTO):**  Consider using a DTO to represent the aggregated data returned by the query. This improves code clarity and allows you to easily adapt the data structure if needed.
