The `getLastEntries` method, using a simple `LIMIT` clause on the `heat_pump` table, can become a performance bottleneck with millions of records. Here are the potential concerns and mitigation strategies:

**Potential Concerns:**

1.  **Full Table Scan:** Without a suitable index, the database might need to perform a full table scan to identify and retrieve the last `n` entries. This is extremely inefficient and slow.
2.  **Sorting:** Even with an index, the database might still need to sort the entire table to determine the most recent entries, depending on how the index is configured.
3.  **Locking:**  If the table is frequently updated, locking contention could further degrade performance.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Index on `measurement_date`:** The most crucial optimization is to create an index on the `measurement_date` column.  This allows the database to quickly locate the most recent entries without scanning the entire table.  A descending index (`CREATE INDEX idx_measurement_date ON heat_pump (measurement_date DESC);`) is ideal for this use case.
2.  **Clustered Index (if applicable):**  If the database supports clustered indexes, consider clustering the table on `measurement_date`. This physically orders the data on disk, further improving retrieval speed.
3.  **Pagination:**  If the application requires more than `n` entries, implement pagination instead of retrieving a large number of records at once. This reduces the load on the database and improves responsiveness.
4.  **Caching:**  Cache the results of the `getLastEntries` query if the data doesn't change frequently. This reduces the number of database queries and improves performance.
5.  **Database Statistics:** Ensure that database statistics are up-to-date. This helps the query optimizer choose the most efficient execution plan.
6.  **Query Optimization Tools:** Use database-specific query optimization tools (e.g., EXPLAIN PLAN) to analyze the query execution plan and identify potential bottlenecks.
7.  **Materialized View (if suitable):** If the `getLastEntries` query is executed frequently and the data doesn't change very often, consider using a materialized view to pre-calculate and store the results. However, this introduces the overhead of maintaining the materialized view.
