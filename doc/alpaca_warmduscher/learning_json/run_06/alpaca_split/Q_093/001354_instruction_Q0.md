You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements a Dialogflow webhook endpoint for a heating system integration. It receives requests from Dialogflow, retrieves current boiler temperature data from the `HeatPumpDataService`, and returns a JSON response with the temperature to be spoken back to the user via Dialogflow. The primary goal is to enable voice control or query of the heating system status.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/DialogFlowWebhookController.java
- **Class Name(s):** `DialogFlowWebhookController`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: 
    - Receive HTTP POST requests from Dialogflow.
    - Parse the Dialogflow request.
    - Retrieve current boiler temperature from `HeatPumpDataService`.
    - Construct a JSON response containing the boiler temperature.
    - Return the JSON response to Dialogflow.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** HTTP POST request body containing a Dialogflow webhook request in JSON format.
    - **Output:** HTTP response body containing a Dialogflow webhook response in JSON format with the boiler temperature.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Receive a POST request at the `/dialalogflow/heating` endpoint.
    2. Parse the request body as a `GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest` object using Jackson.
    3. Call `heatPumpDataService.getCurrent()` to retrieve the current heating system data.
    4. Extract the `boilerTemp` from the returned data.
    5. Construct a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse` object.
    6. Construct a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage` and `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText` to contain the temperature value as text.
    7. Populate the response with the constructed message.
    8. Serialize the response to a JSON string using Jackson.
    9. Return the JSON string as the HTTP response.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **`HeatPumpDataService`**: This service is called to retrieve the current boiler temperature. This is an internal dependency within the application.
    - **Jackson Library**: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
    - **Dialogflow**: Communicates via HTTP POST/response.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Invalid JSON Request**: If the request body is not valid JSON, Jackson will throw an exception, which is not explicitly handled in the current code.
    - **`HeatPumpDataService` Failure**: If the `HeatPumpDataService` fails to retrieve the data or returns an error, the current code will throw an exception.
    - **Missing `boilerTemp`**: The code does not handle the case where `heatPumpDataService.getCurrent()` returns null or does not contain a `boilerTemp`. This will likely result in a `NullPointerException`.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The endpoint should respond within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., < 500ms) to avoid latency in the Dialogflow conversation.
- **Scalability**: The endpoint should be able to handle a moderate number of concurrent requests without performance degradation.
- **Security**: The endpoint should be protected against unauthorized access. (Not addressed in current code)
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple but could benefit from improved error handling and more descriptive variable names.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The endpoint should be available and functioning correctly most of the time. The reliability depends on the `HeatPumpDataService`.
- **Usability**: Integration with Dialogflow should be straightforward and require minimal configuration.
- **Compliance**: The code should adhere to any relevant data privacy regulations.

## 5. Key Components

- **`DialogFlowWebhookController`**: The main controller class that handles the webhook requests.
- **`webhook()` method**: Receives the request, parses it, retrieves data, constructs the response, and returns it.
- **Jackson**: Used for serializing and deserializing JSON.
- **`HeatPumpDataService`**: External service for retrieving heating system data.
- **Error Handling**: Limited. The code does not include explicit try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions.
- **No subclasses**
- **Modules**: The code is a Spring Boot controller, which is a module within the larger application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Java Collections Framework (Lists)
- JSON Parsing and Serialization
- HTTP request handling

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Boot**: Used for creating a RESTful endpoint and dependency injection.
- **Jackson**: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **Google Cloud Dialogflow API Libraries**: For parsing Dialogflow request and constructing response objects (versions v2 & v3 used)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.heating.HeatPumpDataService`**: Provides access to heating system data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: 
    - Cache the boiler temperature to reduce the load on the `HeatPumpDataService`.
- **Code Readability**:
    - Add more descriptive variable names.
    - Add comments to explain complex logic.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Implement authentication/authorization to protect the endpoint.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - Consider using a message queue to handle a high volume of requests.
- **Error Handling**:
    - Add try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions, such as invalid JSON requests, failures in `HeatPumpDataService`, and null values.
    - Log errors for debugging and monitoring.
- **Input Validation**: 
    - Validate the input from Dialogflow to prevent unexpected errors.
- **Testability**:
    - Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the controller and ensure that it handles different scenarios correctly.
