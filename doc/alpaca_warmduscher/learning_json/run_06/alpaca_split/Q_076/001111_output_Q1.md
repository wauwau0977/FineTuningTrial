The current `main` method provides only a single positive test case. To significantly improve the test coverage, the following test cases should be implemented:

**Positive Test Cases:**

1.  **Multiple Recipients:** Send an email to multiple valid email addresses.
2.  **Long Subject/Content:** Test with long subject and content strings to ensure no truncation or errors occur.
3.  **Special Characters:** Include special characters (e.g., emojis, non-ASCII characters) in the subject and content.
4.  **Different Email Providers:**  If possible, test sending emails to addresses on different email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) to verify compatibility.

**Negative Test Cases:**

1.  **Invalid Email Address:** Test sending to an invalid email address (e.g., missing @ symbol, invalid domain). Verify that the appropriate exception is thrown or handled.
2.  **Empty Sender/Password:**  Test with empty `mailSender` or `mailPassword` to ensure the expected exception is thrown.
3.  **Null Receiver List:** Test with a null or empty `receiverMails` string to verify the handling.
4.  **Invalid SMTP Host/Port:** Configure the `host` and `port` variables to invalid values and verify that the connection fails gracefully.
5. **Network Connectivity Issues:** Simulate a network outage to verify that the email sending fails and the application handles the error appropriately.
6. **SMTP Authentication Failure:**  Provide incorrect credentials (sender/password) to intentionally cause an SMTP authentication failure and verify that the application handles it correctly.
7. **Email Injection Attack (Sanitization Test):** Send a subject or content string designed to exploit email injection vulnerabilities (e.g., with newline characters) and verify that the input is properly sanitized.

These test cases should be implemented using a proper testing framework (e.g., JUnit) to ensure that the `MailSend` class behaves as expected in various scenarios and is resilient to potential errors and attacks. Mocking the SMTP server connection is highly recommended to avoid actually sending emails during testing.
