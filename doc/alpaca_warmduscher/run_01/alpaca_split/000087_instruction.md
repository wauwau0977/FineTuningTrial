You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component displays current heating data, including boiler temperature, outdoor temperature (from both the heating system and MeteoSwiss), and a boiler chart. It fetches data and presents it in a user-friendly format within a Material Design card.  The component is designed to update the displayed time whenever `heatingEntity.measurementDate` changes.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.html`
- **Class Name(s):**  This is a template file (HTML), not a class definition.  The associated component would be `OverviewCurrentComponent`.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Displays current heating data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** The component receives data through `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity` objects.
    - **Outputs:** Displays formatted temperature readings and a chart.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Receives `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity` objects as input.
    2. Extracts relevant data (boiler temperature, outdoor temperatures, measurement date).
    3. Formats the data for display using Angular pipes (`date`, `number`).
    4. Displays the formatted data within the Material Design card.
    5. Renders the `app-boiler-chart` component, passing `overviewMode=true`.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **Angular Pipes**:  Uses `date` and `number` pipes for data formatting.
    - **Component Interaction:** Renders and interacts with the `app-boiler-chart` component.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **`heatingEntity.id` is null**: Displays "..." instead of the measurement time. This likely indicates a lack of data.
    - **Data not available**: The component assumes the `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity` objects are populated.  Error handling at the component level (TypeScript) would be responsible for handling potentially missing data.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The component should render quickly.  Performance depends heavily on the data loading time and the complexity of the `app-boiler-chart` component.
- **Scalability**: Not directly applicable to the template file itself, but the component’s underlying data loading and processing should be scalable.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within this template file. The security depends on the data source and how the data is handled in the TypeScript component.
- **Maintainability**:  The template is reasonably well-structured with Angular’s `fxLayout` for responsiveness.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Relies on the availability of data from `heatingEntity` and `meteoSwissEntity`.
- **Usability**:  The layout appears user-friendly and intuitive, presenting key data points clearly.
- **Compliance**:  Assumes compliance with any relevant accessibility standards.

## 5. Key Components

- **Template Structure:** Uses Material Design `mat-card`, `mat-card-header`, `mat-card-content`, `mat-card-footer`, and `mat-title`.
- **Angular Flex Layout:** Uses `fxLayout`, `fxFlex` for responsive design.
- **Data Binding:**  Uses Angular’s data binding syntax (e.g., `{{ heatingEntity.boilerTemp }}`) to display data.
- **Pipes:** Utilizes Angular’s built-in `date` and `number` pipes for formatting.
- **Component:** Renders the `app-boiler-chart` component.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **HTML:** The base markup language.
- **Angular Template Syntax:** Data binding, pipes, directives.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular Material:** Provides Material Design components (cards, titles, etc.).
- **Angular Flex Layout:** Provides a flexible grid system.
- **Angular Common:** Provides common utilities like pipes.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`app-boiler-chart`**:  A custom component within the project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Consider lazy loading the `app-boiler-chart` component if it's computationally expensive.
- **Code Readability:**  The template is reasonably readable, but further optimization could involve breaking down complex expressions into smaller components or functions.
- **Error Handling:**  Add more robust error handling in the associated component to gracefully handle cases where `heatingEntity` or `meteoSwissEntity` are not available. This would likely involve displaying a loading state or an error message.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the component meets accessibility standards (e.g., proper ARIA attributes) for users with disabilities.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The overall application architecture should be considered for scalability.  Consider using a reactive approach to data loading and rendering to improve performance with large datasets.
