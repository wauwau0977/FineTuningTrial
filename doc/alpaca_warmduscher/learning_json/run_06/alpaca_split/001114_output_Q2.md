Parsing the `receiverMails` string directly with `InternetAddress.parse()` can lead to several issues:

*   **Invalid Email Addresses:**  The `InternetAddress.parse()` method might not strictly validate email address formats.  It might accept addresses that are syntactically incorrect but still parsable, leading to delivery failures.
*   **Email Injection Attacks:**  A malicious user could craft the `receiverMails` string to include additional email headers or commands within the email addresses (e.g., adding a `Cc:` or `Bcc:` field). This could potentially compromise the email sending process or introduce security vulnerabilities. While the impact might be limited in this specific context, it's still a bad practice.
*   **Performance Issues:** Parsing a long string with many email addresses can be inefficient, especially if the string is poorly formatted.
*   **Splitting Errors:** If the input string is not properly delimited (e.g., using commas and spaces inconsistently), it can lead to incorrectly parsed email addresses.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Validation:** Before parsing the `receiverMails` string, validate each email address using a regular expression or a dedicated email validation library (e.g., Apache Commons Validator).  This will ensure that only valid email addresses are processed.

2.  **Splitting and Sanitization:**  Instead of directly parsing the entire string, split it into individual email addresses using a reliable delimiter (e.g., comma). Sanitize each email address by removing any leading or trailing whitespace and any potentially harmful characters.

3.  **Use a List:** Modify the method signature to accept a `List<String>` instead of a comma-separated string. This forces the caller to provide a list of validated email addresses, eliminating the need for parsing and validation within the `send` method.  This is the most robust approach.

4.  **Limit the Number of Recipients:**  Impose a reasonable limit on the number of recipients to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks.

5.  **Dedicated Email Address Parsing Library:** Use a library specifically designed for parsing email addresses, which may provide more robust validation and error handling than `InternetAddress.parse()`.

**Example using a List:**

Modify the method signature:

```java
public String send(String subject, String content, List<String> receiverMails) {
```

Then, iterate over the list and add each email address to the message:

```java
for (String email : receiverMails) {
    message.addRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, InternetAddress.parse(email, true));
}
```

By implementing these mitigation strategies, you can significantly improve the security and reliability of the email sending process and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
