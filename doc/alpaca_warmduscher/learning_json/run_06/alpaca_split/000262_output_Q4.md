The test case `it('find interval: 1 week 165 data points --> 4h', () => { ... });` tests the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method with a specific set of inputs to verify that the correct interval key is returned for a given number of data points and time range.

**Purpose:** The test aims to confirm that the method correctly calculates the appropriate time interval based on the number of data points within a one-week timeframe. Specifically, it checks if 165 data points within a week resolve to a 4-hour interval.

**Input Parameters:**

*   `2021, 1, 1`:  Start date (February 1st, 2021).
*   `2021, 1, 8`: End date (February 8th, 2021), resulting in a 7-day (1 week) period.
*   `165`: The number of data points.

**Expected Output:**  The test expects the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method to return an `Interval` object where `interval.key` is equal to `"4h"`. This implies that with 165 data points over a week, the service should determine a 4-hour interval as the optimal granularity for display or processing.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
it('find interval: 1 week 165 data points --> 4h', () => {
  let interval: Interval = service.getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(165, new Date(2021, 1, 1), new Date(2021, 1, 8)); // 1 week 10 data points
  console.log(interval);
  expect(interval).not.toBeNull();
  expect(interval.key).toEqual("4h");
});
```
