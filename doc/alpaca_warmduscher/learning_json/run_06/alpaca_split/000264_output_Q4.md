In a scenario where there are only 2 data points over a week-long period, the expected interval key would be "1d".  The reasoning is that with such a sparse dataset, the goal is to display each data point clearly without overcrowding the visualization.  A "1d" (one day) interval would provide sufficient spacing and clarity, representing each data point as a distinct marker. Intervals smaller than a day would be unnecessary and potentially create visual clutter, while larger intervals would obscure the fact that there are only two data points across the entire week.

Here's how I would implement the new test case:

```typescript
it('find interval: 1 week 2 data points --> 1d', () => {
  let interval: Interval = service.getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(2, new Date(2021, 1, 1), new Date(2021, 1, 8));
  console.log(interval);
  expect(interval).not.toBeNull();
  expect(interval.key).toEqual("1d");
});
```

This test case follows the same structure as the existing tests:

1.  **Call the method:** It calls `service.getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` with the specified input parameters (2 data points, start date, end date).
2.  **Log the interval:** It logs the resulting `interval` object to the console for debugging purposes.
3.  **Assert the result:** It asserts that the `interval.key` is equal to `"1d"`, verifying that the method returns the expected interval.
