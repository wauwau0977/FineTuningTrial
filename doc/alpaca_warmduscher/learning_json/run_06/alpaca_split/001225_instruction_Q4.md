For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java' with name 'GlobalSynced.java' we have the following question: 

Imagine the `Hooks` interface is defined as: `interface Hooks<T> { void before(T obj); void after(T obj); }`. Explain how the `requestOperation` method utilizes this interface and why the `after` hook is always executed, even if an exception occurs during the operation on the `syncedObject`.  Provide a refined version of the `requestOperation` method, focusing solely on the exception handling and hook execution parts, demonstrating the guaranteed execution of the `after` hook.
