For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
if (evict) {
  this.cache[cacheKey] = null;
}
```
What does the `evict` flag accomplish within the `get` method, and how does it impact the subsequent behavior of the caching logic? Explain how it's used to manage the cache's contents.
