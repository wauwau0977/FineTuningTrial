```java
StartupData startupData = context.getBean(StartupData.class);
startupData.reset(); // Call the reset() method before setting the startup time
startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(timeTaken.toMillis());
```

The added line `startupData.reset();` ensures that any previous state within the `StartupData` object is cleared or initialized before the new startup time is set. This promotes predictability and avoids potential issues if the `StartupData` object is reused or retains state between application restarts.  It's a good practice to ensure that the object is in a known state before setting new data.
