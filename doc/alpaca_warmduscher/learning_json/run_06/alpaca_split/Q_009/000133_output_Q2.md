`fixture.detectChanges()` is a method used in Angular testing to trigger change detection for the component being tested.  Change detection is the mechanism by which Angular updates the DOM (Document Object Model) when the component's data changes.  It essentially tells Angular to re-render the component’s template based on its current state.

In this test, it's necessary because the test aims to verify the *rendered* HTML content. The component's initial state might not immediately reflect the expected HTML.  `fixture.detectChanges()` forces Angular to run change detection, update the DOM to reflect the component's state, and then the test can verify the resulting HTML content using `querySelector`.

If `fixture.detectChanges()` was omitted, the test would likely fail because `compiled.querySelector('.content span')` would return `null` or an element that doesn't contain the expected text. This is because the component’s template wouldn’t have been rendered yet, so the element wouldn’t exist in the DOM.  The test would be operating on an uninitialized DOM, leading to inaccurate results.
