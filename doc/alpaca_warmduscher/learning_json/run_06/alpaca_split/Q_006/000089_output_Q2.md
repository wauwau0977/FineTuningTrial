The `@NgModule` decorator is a class decorator that defines a module in Angular. Modules are containers for related components, directives, services, and other Angular elements. They help organize an application into logical blocks and control the visibility and accessibility of components within those blocks. Essentially, it's a way to package functionality together.

In this `AppRoutingModule` example:

*   `imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)]` indicates that this module imports the `RouterModule` and configures it with the `routes` array. This is where the root routing configuration is applied.  The `RouterModule` provides the routing functionality.

*   `exports: [RouterModule]` indicates that this module exports the `RouterModule`, making its features (such as directives for router links and router outlets) available to other modules that import this `AppRoutingModule`. Other modules need to import this module to utilize the configured routing functionality.  Without exporting, other modules wouldn't be able to use the router.
