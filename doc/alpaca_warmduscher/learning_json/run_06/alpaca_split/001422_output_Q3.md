The `@RequestMapping("/memory")` annotation maps HTTP requests with the path "/memory" to the `getMemoryInfo()` method.  This means that when a client sends a request to `/memory` on the server, this method will be invoked to handle the request. It essentially defines the endpoint for this functionality.

The `@ResponseBody` annotation indicates that the return value of the `getMemoryInfo()` method should be serialized and returned as the body of the HTTP response.  It's a signal to Spring's message converters to take the `MemoryInfo` object and convert it into a format suitable for transmission to the client (typically JSON or XML, depending on the client's `Accept` header and the configured message converters).

Together, these annotations enable building a RESTful API.  The `@RequestMapping` defines the resource path, and the `@ResponseBody` ensures that the response is in a standard format suitable for consumption by clients, adhering to the principles of REST. The method retrieves the current memory information and returns it as a response to the client request.
