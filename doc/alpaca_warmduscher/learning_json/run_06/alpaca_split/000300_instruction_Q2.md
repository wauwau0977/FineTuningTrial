For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.sass' with name 'about.component.sass'... 
The following styles are applied to a video container:
```sass
.video-holder
  display: flex
  flex-direction: column
  align-items: center
.video
  height: 50vh
  object-fit: scale-down
  margin-bottom: 25px
```
What is the likely intention behind these styles, and how might this layout impact the user experience on devices with different aspect ratios? Consider the implications of using a fixed height (`50vh`).
