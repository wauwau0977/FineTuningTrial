`fixedDelayString` and `cron` are both used for scheduling tasks in Spring, but they operate differently.

*   **`fixedDelayString`:** Schedules tasks based on a fixed delay *after* the previous task completes.  It’s expressed as an ISO 8601 duration string (e.g., "PT900s" for 15 minutes).  This means the task will run repeatedly, with the specified delay between executions. The actual start time isn’t precisely defined – it depends on when the initial task completes.

*   **`cron`:** Schedules tasks based on a cron expression, which defines specific times, dates, and intervals (e.g., "0 15 * * *" for every hour on the 15th minute).  The task will execute at the *specified* times, regardless of how long the previous execution took.

For scenarios where data polling needs to happen at precise times (e.g., every hour on the 15th minute), **`cron`** is the more suitable option.  This is because `cron` allows you to define the *exact* times at which the task should run, ensuring the polling happens at the desired intervals, regardless of execution time. `fixedDelayString` is more appropriate for tasks where a regular interval is desired, but the exact start time isn’t critical.
