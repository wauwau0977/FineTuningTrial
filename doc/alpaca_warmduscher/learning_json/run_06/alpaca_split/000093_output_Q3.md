The `AppRoutingModule` class is an Angular module class that encapsulates the application's routing configuration. While it *appears* empty in this particular example, its primary role isn't to contain logic within the class itself, but to *define* and *export* the routing module. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Module Declaration:**  It declares a class decorated with `@NgModule` which tells Angular that this class defines a module.
2. **Configuration Holder:** The `@NgModule` decorator and its associated properties (`imports`, `exports`, etc.) *hold* the routing configuration (the routes themselves and the `RouterModule`).
3. **Centralized Routing:** It provides a centralized place to manage the application's routes.  Other modules can import `AppRoutingModule` to gain access to these routes.
4. **Bootstrapping:** The `AppRoutingModule` is imported into the root `AppModule` which ensures that Angular's router is initialized during the application's bootstrapping process.

The emptiness of the class body itself is common; it acts as a container for the module's metadata (the `@NgModule` configuration). The class doesn't need to contain any specific methods or properties as the routing logic is handled by the `RouterModule` and the routes defined within the `@NgModule` decorator.  It's a common pattern in Angular for modules to be defined with minimal class code and rely on the `@NgModule` configuration for most of their functionality.
