`fixture.detectChanges()` triggers change detection in the Angular testing environment.  Angular applications are reactive, meaning the view (DOM) is updated whenever the component's data changes. However, in tests, these changes aren't automatically detected. `fixture.detectChanges()` manually triggers the change detection cycle, which updates the DOM to reflect the component's current state. Without this line, the DOM wouldn't be updated, and `querySelector` would likely return `null` or incorrect results. It's critical to run `detectChanges()` whenever the component's state is modified before attempting to query or interact with the rendered DOM.

The assertion `expect(compiled.querySelector('.content span')?.textContent).toContain('thserver-client app is running!');` verifies that the rendered HTML contains the expected text within a specific element. Letâ€™s break it down:

*   `compiled` is a reference to the native DOM element of the component (obtained using `fixture.nativeElement`).
*   `querySelector('.content span')` searches for the first `span` element within an element with the class `content`.
*   `?.textContent` accesses the text content of the found `span` element. The `?` is optional chaining, which prevents an error if `querySelector` returns `null` (meaning the element wasn't found).
*   `.toContain('thserver-client app is running!')` asserts that the text content of the `span` element *contains* the specified string. This verifies that the component is rendering the expected title or message in the DOM. It's a common way to test that a component's template is displaying the correct information.
