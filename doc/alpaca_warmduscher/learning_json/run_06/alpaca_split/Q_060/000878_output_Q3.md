The `@Entity` annotation marks the `HeatPumpEntity` class as a JPA entity, signifying that instances of this class will be mapped to a database table.  The `name = "HEAT_PUMP"` attribute specifies the name of the database table that this entity corresponds to.

The `@Table` annotation provides additional configuration for the table mapping.  In this case, it defines an index.

The `@Index` annotation defines an index on the `measurementDate` column of the `HEAT_PUMP` table. The `name = "HEAT_PUMP_IX_1"` attribute gives the index a specific name within the database.  Creating an index on `measurementDate` improves the performance of queries that filter or sort based on this column. It allows the database to quickly locate relevant rows without scanning the entire table.
