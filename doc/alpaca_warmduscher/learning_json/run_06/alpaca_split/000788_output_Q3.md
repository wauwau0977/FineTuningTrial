The `GROUP BY measurement_date` clause groups rows with the same `measurement_date` value together. This is crucial because the query uses the aggregate function `AVG(temperature)`.  Without `GROUP BY`, `AVG(temperature)` would calculate the average temperature across *all* rows matching the date range, resulting in a single average value. 

With `GROUP BY measurement_date`, `AVG(temperature)` is applied to each group of rows having the same `measurement_date`. This effectively calculates the average temperature *for each* distinct date within the specified range. The result set will therefore contain one row per unique `measurement_date`, where each row contains the `measurement_date` and the corresponding average temperature for that date. This allows for time-series analysis of temperature data.
