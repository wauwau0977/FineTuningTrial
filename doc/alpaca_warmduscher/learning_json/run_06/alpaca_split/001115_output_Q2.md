Logging sufficient information within the `catch` block is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the root cause of email sending failures. Simply throwing a `RuntimeException` obscures the original error and makes troubleshooting difficult.

**Information to Log:**

1.  **Exception Class Name:** Log the fully qualified name of the `MessagingException` class (e.g., `javax.mail.internet.AddressException`). This helps identify the specific type of error.
2.  **Exception Message:** Log the exception's message, which provides a human-readable description of the error.
3.  **Stack Trace:** Log the full stack trace of the exception. This provides a detailed history of the method calls that led to the error, helping pinpoint the exact location of the problem.
4.  **Contextual Information:** Include any relevant contextual information, such as the `receiverMails` string, the `subject`, and the `content` of the email. This helps understand the circumstances surrounding the error.
5.  **Correlation ID (if applicable):** If the application uses a correlation ID for tracking requests, include it in the log message to easily correlate the email sending failure with the related request.

**Modified Code:**

```java
try {
    Transport.send(message);
    log.info("Sent mail to=" + receiverMails + " subject=" + subject + " content=" + content);
} catch (MessagingException e) {
    log.error("Could not send email to " + receiverMails + ", subject=" + subject, e); // Log the exception with context
    RuntimeException e1 = new RuntimeException("Could not send email to " + receiverMails, e);
    throw e1;
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I've used `log.error()` to log the exception with a descriptive message.
*   The `e` parameter is passed directly to `log.error()`, which automatically logs the exception's class name, message, and stack trace.
*   The context of the email (receiver, subject) is also logged.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Debugging:** Logging the stack trace makes it much easier to identify the root cause of the error.
*   **Monitoring:** Logging error information allows you to monitor the frequency of email sending failures and identify potential problems.
*   **Troubleshooting:** When an error occurs, the log messages provide valuable information for troubleshooting.
*   **Auditing:** Log messages can be used for auditing and tracking email sending activity.

By logging this information, you significantly improve the maintainability and reliability of the application.
