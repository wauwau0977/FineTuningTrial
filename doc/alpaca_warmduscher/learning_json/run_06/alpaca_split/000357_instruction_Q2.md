For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.sass' with name 'boiler-chart.component.sass'... 
Consider the following selectors:
```sass
.chartItem
  margin-right: -15px
  margin-left: -15px
  display: flex
  align-items: center
  justify-content: center
```

What layout characteristics are being enforced by these styles, and what common UI pattern might this be used to achieve? What are the potential drawbacks of using negative margins for layout?
