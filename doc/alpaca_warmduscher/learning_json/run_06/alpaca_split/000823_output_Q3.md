The generic types `<SessionRequest, String>` define the entity type and the primary key type for the repository. `SessionRequest` represents the Java class that maps to a database table (and represents a row within that table). `String` specifies that the primary key for the `SessionRequest` entity is a String. This means the database table corresponding to `SessionRequest` likely has a string-based primary key column (e.g., a session ID). Spring Data JPA uses this information to generate the necessary database queries and data mapping logic.
