Without proper unsubscription, multiple subscriptions can lead to memory leaks. Each subscription keeps the observable executing and its associated resources allocated, even if the component is destroyed. This can lead to a buildup of unused resources and eventually degrade application performance or cause crashes. Specifically, in an Angular component, if the component is navigated away from or destroyed while the subscriptions are still active, the observables might continue to emit values to a component that no longer exists, leading to errors and memory leaks.

In the given code, there's **no explicit unsubscription** implemented. This is a significant issue. The subscriptions are created in `ngOnInit()` and `constructor()`, but there's no corresponding code to unsubscribe from them in `ngOnDestroy()`.

The component *should* implement `ngOnDestroy()` and unsubscribe from each observable using the `unsubscribe()` method on the subscription object.

```typescript
import {Component, EventEmitter, HostListener, OnInit, OnDestroy, Output} from '@angular/core';

//... other imports

export class OverviewCurrentComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  //... other properties

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    // Unsubscribe from all subscriptions
    this.meteoCurrentSubscription?.unsubscribe();
    this.meteoHistoricalSubscription?.unsubscribe();
    this.currentSubscription?.unsubscribe();
  }

  //... other methods

  myReload() {
    this.meteoCurrentSubscription = this.heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissCurrent(true, "KLO").subscribe(data => {
      this.meteoSwissEntity = MeteoSwissEntity.ofWebService(data);
    });

    this.meteoHistoricalSubscription = this.heatingDataService.getMeteoSwissHistorical(true, dateFrom, dateTo, 1, 0, new Set<string>().add("KLO")).subscribe(data => {
      console.log("Completed service call historic meteo:", data);
    });

    this.currentSubscription = this.heatingDataService.getCurrent(true).subscribe((data: any) => {
      this.heatingEntity = HeatingEntity.ofWebService(data);
    });
  }
}
```

By implementing `ngOnDestroy()` and unsubscribing from the observables, we prevent memory leaks and ensure that the application resources are properly released when the component is destroyed. Also, Iâ€™d recommend storing the subscriptions as component properties to access them during the unsubscription process.
