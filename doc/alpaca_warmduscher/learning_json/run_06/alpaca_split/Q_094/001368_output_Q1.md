This class, `JSONFactory`, serves as a Spring component responsible for providing an instance of `JacksonFactory`.  `JacksonFactory` is a Google API client library component used for serializing and deserializing JSON. The `@Bean` annotation tells Spring that the `jacksonFactory()` method should be registered as a bean in the application context.  

The problem it solves is providing a readily available, pre-configured instance of `JacksonFactory` that can be autowired into other components that require JSON processing. Without this bean definition, other components would need to create their own `JacksonFactory` instances, potentially leading to inconsistencies or duplicated configuration. Using `@Bean` allows for centralized management and potential customization of the `JacksonFactory` instance.  It promotes a more loosely coupled and testable design.
