These lines demonstrate dependency injection. `sessionRequestRepository` is a field of type `SessionRequestRepository`. The constructor `MvcConfig(SessionRequestRepository sessionRequestRepository)` takes an instance of `SessionRequestRepository` as a parameter and assigns it to the class field `this.sessionRequestRepository`. This means that instead of `MvcConfig` creating its own `SessionRequestRepository` instance, it receives one from an external source (likely a Spring container). This is dependency injection – the class depends on `SessionRequestRepository`, but it doesn’t *create* it; it receives it. This promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability. The `super()` call invokes the constructor of the parent class (likely `Object`), though it doesn’t perform any specific operation in this case.
