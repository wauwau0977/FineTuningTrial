For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/JSONFactory.java' with name 'JSONFactory.java' we have the following question: 
Imagine the requirement changes and the application needs to support both JSON and YAML serialization/deserialization. How would you modify the `JSONFactory` class to provide both options while maintaining a clean and extensible design? Detail the changes and explain how a component could choose between JSON and YAML. Include any necessary annotations or configuration considerations.
