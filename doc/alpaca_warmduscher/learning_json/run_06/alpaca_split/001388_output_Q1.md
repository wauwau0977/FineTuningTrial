Returning a simple `String` as a success/failure indicator is straightforward and easy to implement. However, it's quite limited and offers minimal feedback to the client. A success string doesn't indicate *what* succeeded, and a failure string doesnâ€™t pinpoint the *reason* for the failure. This makes debugging and error handling on the client-side difficult. The client might only know *that* the email sending failed, but not *why* (e.g., invalid email address, service unavailable, internal error).

The response could be significantly improved by:

1.  **Using a structured response (e.g., JSON):** Return a JSON object containing a `status` (success/failure) and a `message` field providing more detailed information about the outcome.  This allows the client to programmatically interpret the response and handle errors appropriately.
2.  **Returning HTTP status codes:**  Utilize appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) to convey the outcome of the request. This is a standard practice in RESTful APIs.
3.  **Including an error code:** Add a specific error code to the response to allow the client to identify and handle specific error scenarios.
4.  **Logging detailed error information:** While not part of the response, comprehensive logging on the server-side is crucial for debugging and troubleshooting.

For example, instead of returning `"success"` or `"failure"`, the service could return:

`{"status": "success", "message": "Email sent successfully"}`
or
`{"status": "error", "message": "Invalid email address", "errorCode": "INVALID_EMAIL"}`
