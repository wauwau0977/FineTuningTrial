You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This file, `styles.sass`, contains global stylesheet rules for the 'Warmduscher' projectâ€™s web client. It defines CSS classes for consistent styling of elements within the application, including card borders, snackbar background colors, and a specific height for the `.myLastSpace` class. It utilizes the Sass preprocessor for improved styling capabilities.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass`
- **Class Name(s):** `.myLastSpace`, `.mat-card`, `.mat-snack-bar-container`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Defines visual styles for specific HTML elements used in the Warmduscher web client.  It aims to create a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  This file does not directly handle user input. It outputs CSS rules that are interpreted by the browser to visually render elements.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The file contains a series of CSS class definitions, each defining specific visual properties (height, border color, margin, background color). These styles are applied to HTML elements to achieve the desired appearance.
- **External Interactions:**  None directly. The Sass file is processed (compiled) into CSS which is then linked to the HTML documents in the web client.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** There is no specific error handling within the stylesheet itself. However, incorrect CSS syntax will be flagged during the Sass compilation process.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The file size is small, therefore it should not significantly impact page load times.
- **Scalability:** The stylesheet can be extended with more styles as the application grows.  Organization and naming conventions will be key to maintainability.
- **Security:**  No direct security implications. CSS is generally considered safe.
- **Maintainability:** The Sass syntax allows for nesting and variables, which can improve code readability and maintainability.  However, the current file is simple and could benefit from more structure if it grows larger.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The stylesheet itself is static and therefore highly reliable. Availability depends on the web server hosting the files.
- **Usability:**  The defined styles contribute to the overall usability of the application by providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
- **Compliance:**  The CSS used should comply with web standards and best practices.

## 5. Key Components

- **`.myLastSpace`**: Sets the height of an element to 100px.  Purpose is likely to ensure a specific amount of space at the bottom of a section.
- **`.mat-card`**: Modifies the styling of Material Design cards, specifically setting the border color to white, the border width to 1px, and margins of 12px on top/bottom and 3px on left/right.
- **`.mat-snack-bar-container`**: Sets the background color of the Material Design snackbar container to a light gray (rgba(200,200,200)).
- **Error handling:** None explicit. Sass compilation will report syntax errors.
- **Classes:** None subclasses defined.
- **Modules:** None.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Sass Syntax:** Utilizes the Sass preprocessor syntax (nesting, variables, etc.).
- **CSS Properties:**  Uses standard CSS properties (height, border-color, border-width, margin, background-color).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Material Design:** Styling rules are geared toward Material Design components, suggesting a dependency on a Material Design library (likely Angular Material).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- Potentially relies on consistent application of Material Design theme and color palettes throughout the Warmduscher project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** No immediate performance concerns due to the file's small size.
- **Code Readability:** Consider using comments to explain the purpose of each style rule, especially if the file grows larger.
- **Security Improvements:** No specific security risks.
- **Scalability Considerations:** For larger applications, consider organizing styles into more modular files (e.g., one file for components, one for typography, etc.) to improve maintainability and scalability.  Using a CSS naming convention like BEM would also improve organization.
- **Variable Usage:** Introduce variables for colors, font sizes, and other frequently used values to improve consistency and ease of maintenance.  (e.g. `$light-gray: rgba(200,200,200);` then `background-color: $light-gray;`)
