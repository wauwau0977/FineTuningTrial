In Spring MVC, an interceptor is a component that intercepts incoming HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses. It allows you to perform pre-processing (before the request reaches the controller) and post-processing (after the controller has processed the request) logic. Interceptors can be used for a variety of purposes, such as authentication, authorization, logging, request transformation, and response modification.  They act as a 'filter' for web requests.

In the 'Warmduscher' application, a likely scenario for the `MyRequestInterceptor` is to track or audit session requests. Given the `SessionRequestRepository` dependency, the interceptor could log details of each incoming request (e.g., timestamp, user ID, request URL) into the database using the repository. This would allow the application to monitor usage patterns, identify potential security threats, or troubleshoot issues related to specific requests. Alternatively, it could be used to enforce rate limiting on requests from a particular user or IP address. It's also possible the interceptor is involved in maintaining or validating session state before a request is processed.
