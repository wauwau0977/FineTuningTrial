The `<app-boiler-chart>` component is a custom Angular component likely responsible for displaying a chart related to the boiler's performance or data. It’s a reusable UI element defined elsewhere in the project.

*   `[overviewMode]="true"`: This is an input binding. It passes a boolean value `true` to the `overviewMode` input property of the `app-boiler-chart` component.  This input likely controls how the chart is rendered—in this case, setting it to a simplified "overview" mode, possibly showing less detailed data or a different visualization.
*   `class="standAlone"`: This applies the CSS class "standAlone" to the `app-boiler-chart` element.  This class is used for styling purposes, likely to position the chart independently or provide specific visual formatting. It’s probably defined in a CSS stylesheet to control things like margins, padding, or layout.

The commented-out `<app-overview-current-gauge>` suggests an alternative visualization that was considered but is currently disabled.
