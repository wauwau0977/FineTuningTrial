For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts' with name 'cache.service.spec.ts' we have the following question: 
Summarize the provided unit test for the `CacheService`. Specifically, explain the purpose of the `describe` block, the `beforeEach` setup function, and the single test case (`it` block). Detail what is being asserted within the test case and what it ultimately verifies about the `CacheService`.
