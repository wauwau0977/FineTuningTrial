Modifying the original `req` object directly would violate the principle of immutability and could lead to unexpected side effects in other parts of the application. Angularâ€™s HTTP stack expects requests to be immutable. If `req` was modified directly, other interceptors or the HTTP client itself might be operating on a different request than they expect, leading to bugs that are difficult to track down. Cloning ensures that each interceptor works with its own copy of the request, modifying it without affecting other parts of the pipeline. The cloned request, `modifiedReq`, is then passed to the next handler.
