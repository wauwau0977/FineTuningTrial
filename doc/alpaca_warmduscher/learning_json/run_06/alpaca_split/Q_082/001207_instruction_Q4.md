For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Utils.java' with name 'Utils.java' we have the following question: 

The method `getRequestIP` aims to determine the client's IP address from an HttpServletRequest object. It iterates through a predefined array of header names, commonly used to store proxy or forwarded IP addresses. Explain the logic of this method, specifically focusing on how it handles multiple IP addresses within a single header and how it defaults to the remote address if no suitable header is found. Be precise in describing the return value.
