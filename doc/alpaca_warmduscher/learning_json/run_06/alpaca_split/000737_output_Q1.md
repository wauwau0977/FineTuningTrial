Lombok's `@Data` annotation automatically generates several boilerplate methods for the `ResDateValue` class, including getters, setters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. This significantly reduces the amount of repetitive code that a developer would otherwise need to write manually, leading to cleaner, more concise, and more maintainable code. It improves developer productivity and reduces the risk of errors associated with manually implementing these methods.

Potential drawbacks of using Lombok include:

* **Increased build complexity:** Lombok uses an annotation processor during compilation, which adds a step to the build process. This can slightly increase build times, although typically the impact is minimal.
* **Debugging challenges:** The generated code is not visible in the IDE by default, which can sometimes make debugging more challenging. However, most IDEs offer features to show the generated code on demand.
* **Dependency on Lombok:**  The project becomes dependent on the Lombok library. If Lombok is not configured correctly or is unavailable, the project may not compile.
* **Potential for confusion:** Developers unfamiliar with Lombok may be surprised by the absence of explicitly defined getters/setters in the source code.

Overall, the benefits of using Lombok in this situation generally outweigh the drawbacks, particularly when dealing with data classes like `ResDateValue`.  It's a valuable tool for reducing boilerplate and improving code quality.
