You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `HeatingDataService`, is responsible for retrieving heating and meteorological data from a backend service. It leverages caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce load on the server. The service offers various methods to fetch current data, historical data, and statistics related to the heating system and external weather conditions.  It primarily interacts with an HTTP API and utilizes the `CacheService` for managing cached responses.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingDataService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Fetch current heating system data.
    - Fetch historical heating system data within a specified time range.
    - Fetch current meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    - Fetch historical meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    - Fetch boiler statistics grouped by day of the week.
    - Fetch boiler statistics grouped by hour.
    - Fetch sole temperature delta statistics while the system is in operation.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: Start and end dates/times (Moment objects), maximum number of data rows, grouping interval in seconds, station IDs (for MeteoSwiss data), a boolean flag to control cache eviction.
    - **Outputs**: Observable of the HTTP response (containing heating or meteorological data) or an error.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The service receives a request for data.
    2. It checks if the requested data is already cached using the `CacheService`.
    3. If the data is in the cache, it returns the cached data.
    4. If the data is not in the cache, it makes an HTTP request to the backend service.
    5. Upon receiving the response from the backend, it caches the data using the `CacheService` and returns it.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **HTTP API**:  The service makes HTTP GET requests to a backend API (base URL defined in `environment.serviceBaseURL`).  Specific API endpoints include:
        - `/heatpump-data/current`
        - `/heatpump-data/getBetweenDates`
        - `/meteo-swiss/current`
        - `/meteo-swiss/getBetweenDates`
        - `/info/general`
        - `/heatpump-data/getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek`
        - `/heatpump-data/getBoilerStatsByHour`
        - `/heatpump-data/getSoleDeltaInOperationStats`
    - **CacheService**: Utilizes `CacheService` for caching and retrieving data.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Network Errors**:  HTTP requests may fail due to network connectivity issues. The service should handle these errors gracefully (e.g., by logging the error and returning a default value or an error message).
    - **Invalid Input**: Invalid input parameters (e.g., invalid date ranges) should be handled appropriately, potentially logging an error and/or returning a default value.
    - **API Errors**: The backend API may return error responses (e.g., HTTP status codes other than 200). The service should handle these errors appropriately.
    - **Cache Errors**: Errors accessing the cache should be handled, potentially falling back to a direct API call.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:
    - API calls should be cached to minimize latency.
    - HTTP requests should be efficient to reduce network overhead.
- **Scalability**:  The service should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests. Caching helps to improve scalability by reducing the load on the backend API.
- **Security**:  Ensure secure communication with the backend API (e.g., using HTTPS).  Consider authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Maintainability**:  The code should be well-structured, modular, and documented.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The service should be reliable and available with minimal downtime.  Caching and error handling contribute to increased reliability.
- **Usability**: The service should be easy to integrate into other parts of the application.
- **Compliance**:  Adhere to any relevant data privacy regulations.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `convertDate(utcDateText)`: Converts a UTC date string to a JavaScript Date object.
    - `convertDateToTime(utcDateText)`: Converts a UTC date string to a timestamp (milliseconds).
    - `getCurrent(evictCache)`: Fetches current heating data.
    - `getHistorical(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecond)`: Fetches historical heating data.
    - `getServerInfo()`: Fetches general server information.
    - `getMeteoSwissCurrent(evictCache, stationId)`: Fetches current meteorological data.
    - `getMeteoSwissHistorical(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecond, stationIds, doNotCache)`: Fetches historical meteorological data.
    - `getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek(evictCache, from, to)`: Fetches boiler stats by day of the week.
    - `getBoilerStatsByHour(evictCache, from, to)`: Fetches boiler stats by hour.
    - `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecond)`: Fetches sole temperature delta stats.
- **Important logic flows**:
    - Data retrieval flow: Check cache -> Fetch data from API (if not in cache) -> Cache data -> Return data.
- **Error handling**:  Utilizes the error handling mechanisms provided by the `HttpClient` and `CacheService`.
- **Classes**:  No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class utilizes Angular modules for dependency injection and HTTP communication.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures**:  Arrays, Objects
- **Date/Time manipulation**: Uses `moment.js` for date and time manipulation.
- **HTTP Client**: Angular's `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular**:  Used for component creation and dependency injection.
- **moment.js**:  A JavaScript date and time library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous operations and streams of data.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`./cache/cache.service`**: The `CacheService` is used for caching HTTP responses.
- **`../environments/environment`**: Used to access the `serviceBaseURL`.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments**:
    - Investigate potential bottlenecks in HTTP requests and caching mechanisms.
    - Consider using a more efficient caching strategy (e.g., using a local storage or memory cache).
- **Code Readability**:
    - Refactor large functions into smaller, reusable units.
    - Add more comprehensive comments and documentation.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the API.
    - Validate input parameters to prevent injection attacks.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - Consider using a distributed caching system to improve scalability.
    - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    - Consider using a message queue to handle asynchronous tasks.
