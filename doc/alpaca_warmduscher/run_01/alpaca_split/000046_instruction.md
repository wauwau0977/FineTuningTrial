You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `AuditLogEntity`, represents an audit log entry for the 'Warmduscher' project. It stores information about events occurring within the system, including a timestamp, scopes (categorization), a message, details, and any associated exceptions. The primary purpose is to provide a persistent record for auditing, debugging, and monitoring purposes.  It’s designed for use with a relational database using JPA/Hibernate.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `AuditLogEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Persists audit log entries to the database. Provides access to audit log data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** Data to be logged (scope, message, details, exception). This is provided during object instantiation or through setter methods.
    - **Outputs:** The `AuditLogEntity` object itself, as it’s persisted to the database. Database queries will return instances of this class.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  An instance of `AuditLogEntity` is created, populated with relevant information.
    2.  The object is persisted to the database using JPA/Hibernate.
    3.  Data can be retrieved from the database by querying for `AuditLogEntity` instances.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **Database:** JPA/Hibernate interactions for persisting and retrieving data. The entity is mapped to a database table named "AUDIT_LOG_ENTITY" with an index on the `createDate` column.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Null values:** The code handles null values for the `scope`, `message`, `detail`, and `exception` fields.  These fields are String and can be null.
    - **Large Text Fields:** The `message`, `detail` and `exception` fields are annotated with `@Lob` and `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` to handle large text inputs.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Database queries should be optimized to retrieve audit logs efficiently.  The index on `createDate` is intended to help with time-based queries.
- **Scalability**: The database schema should be designed to handle a large volume of audit log entries.
- **Security**: Access to audit logs should be restricted to authorized personnel.  The application layer will need to enforce this access control.
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The database system must ensure data persistence and availability.
- **Usability**: The class is designed for internal use by the application and is not directly exposed to end-users.
- **Compliance**: Audit logs may need to be retained for a specific period to comply with regulatory requirements. This retention policy is external to this class.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - **Constructor:** Creates a new `AuditLogEntity` instance with provided data.
    - **Getters & Setters:** Provide access to and modification of the entity's attributes.
    - **`equals(Object o)` and `hashCode()`:** Implement equality comparison based on the `id` field.
- **Important logic flows:**
    - Object creation and population.
    - Data persistence through JPA/Hibernate.
    - Data retrieval through database queries.
- **Error handling:** No explicit error handling is implemented within the class itself. Error handling will be managed by the calling application.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:** The class is part of the 'thserver' module within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures:** Strings, Dates
- **Object-oriented features:** Classes, objects, encapsulation

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **JPA/Hibernate:** Used for object-relational mapping and database interaction.
- **Hibernate Annotations:** Provides annotations for mapping the class to the database table.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly stated in the code.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Consider adding more indexes to the database table based on common query patterns.
- **Code Readability:** The class is already relatively readable. No significant changes are needed.
- **Security Improvements:** Implement data masking or encryption for sensitive fields if necessary.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Consider using a sharded database or a distributed logging system for extremely high volumes of audit logs.  Consider archiving older audit log data to improve database performance.
