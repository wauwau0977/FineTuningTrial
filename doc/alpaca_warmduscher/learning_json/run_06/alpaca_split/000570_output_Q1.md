The `.textBig` and `.boilerTemp` classes are likely used to apply specific styling to elements within the HTML template associated with this component. `.textBig` applies a margin-bottom of 1px, probably to increase the spacing below a text element, making it visually more prominent.  `.boilerTemp` applies a margin-left of 10px, likely intended to visually offset a temperature display or label, perhaps to create a layout where the temperature reading appears slightly indented. 

In the HTML, they would be applied as class attributes to elements, such as: `<p class="textBig">Some Important Text</p>` or `<span class="boilerTemp">75Â°C</span>`. The specific content and context would determine exactly what elements these classes are applied to, but the Sass suggests a focus on visual spacing for important text and temperature readings.
