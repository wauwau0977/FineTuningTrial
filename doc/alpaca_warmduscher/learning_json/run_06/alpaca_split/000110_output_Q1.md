The `margin-left: -7px` is a hack to likely address a visual misalignment or overflow issue with the `.toolbarNav` element.  It's attempting to shift the toolbar slightly to the left to compensate for some rendering difference or unintended spacing. Without seeing the surrounding HTML or other CSS, it’s difficult to know the precise issue, but it’s very likely that the toolbar is slightly wider than its container, causing it to visually overflow or appear misaligned.

Potential issues include:

*   **Responsiveness:** The hack might not work consistently across different screen sizes and resolutions, leading to visual bugs on different devices.
*   **Maintainability:**  It's not immediately clear *why* the negative margin is needed, making it hard for other developers (or yourself in the future) to understand and maintain the code.
*   **Unexpected Side Effects:** Shifting the element visually might affect the layout of other elements on the page.

A better approach would be to:

1.  **Inspect the layout:** Use browser developer tools to identify the root cause of the misalignment. Is it padding, borders, or some other CSS property causing the overflow?
2.  **Fix the underlying issue:** Address the root cause instead of applying a hack. This might involve adjusting padding, margins, or box-sizing properties on the `.toolbarNav` or its parent elements.  Consider using Flexbox or Grid layouts to create a more robust and predictable layout.
3.  **Consider box-sizing:**  Using `box-sizing: border-box` on the `.toolbarNav` and potentially its parent can help ensure that padding and borders are included within the element's width, preventing unexpected overflows.
