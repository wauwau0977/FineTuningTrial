For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts' with name 'cache.service.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
import { CacheService } from "./cache.service";
import {TestBed} from "@angular/core/testing";
describe('CurrentDataService', () => {
 let service: CacheService;
 beforeEach(() => {
   TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
   service = TestBed.inject(CacheService);
 });
```

What is the purpose of `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})` within the `beforeEach` block, and why is it crucial for the proper execution of the tests defined within this test suite?
