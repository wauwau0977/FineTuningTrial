The `signed` boolean parameter in the `readInputRegister` method determines whether the value read from the Modbus register should be interpreted as a signed integer. Modbus registers can represent both unsigned and signed integers, and this parameter allows the method to correctly interpret the data.

If `signed` is `true`, the method calls the `getSignedNumber` method to handle potential negative numbers.  The `getSignedNumber` method implements logic to convert a 16-bit integer (short) into a signed value, accounting for the two's complement representation commonly used in Modbus for negative numbers. Specifically, it checks if the value `vInt` is greater than or equal to 32768. If it is, it's treated as a negative number, and the value is adjusted to represent its negative equivalent. If `vInt` is less than 32768, it's treated as a positive number.

The core principle behind handling signed numbers is to interpret values in the upper range (32768-65535) of a 16-bit register as negative values. This allows the method to accurately represent the full range of signed integers supported by Modbus.
