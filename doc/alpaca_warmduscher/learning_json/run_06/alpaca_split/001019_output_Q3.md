These fields are storing temperature-related data. Specifically: `temperature` likely represents the current temperature reading, `temperatureMin` the minimum temperature recorded for a certain period (e.g., a day, a week), `temperatureMax` the maximum temperature recorded in the same period, and `temperatureMeasureDate` the date and time when the current temperature was measured.

Storing this range of data provides a more comprehensive view of the temperature conditions.  Instead of only knowing the temperature at a single moment, the application can track temperature trends, calculate daily/weekly averages, identify extreme temperatures, and provide historical data for analysis. This is particularly useful for applications that need to monitor environmental conditions, predict weather patterns, or provide data-driven insights. It allows for more informed decisions and a better understanding of the temperature environment.
