This code snippet sets up a timer that automatically calls the `myReload()` method of the component every 3 minutes (1000 * 180 milliseconds).

*   **`interval(1000 * 180)`**: This is an RxJS operator that creates an Observable that emits a value at a specified interval. In this case, it emits a value every 180 seconds (3 minutes).

*   **`.subscribe(val => { this.myReload(); })`**: This subscribes to the Observable created by `interval`.  Each time the Observable emits a value (every 3 minutes), the provided callback function ( `val => { this.myReload(); }`) is executed.

*   **`this.myReload()`**: This is a method (presumably defined elsewhere in the component) that likely refreshes or reloads the chart data. It's the action that's triggered by the timer.

Essentially, this code implements an automatic data refresh mechanism. The charts will be updated with the latest data every 3 minutes without any user interaction, ensuring that the displayed information is reasonably current. This is useful for monitoring systems where data changes over time, providing near real-time visualization.
