The `extractFromJSON` method is responsible for parsing the JSON response from the MeteoSwiss API and extracting specific data points related to a given `stationId`. It utilizes the Jayway JsonPath library to navigate the JSON structure and retrieve the required values.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **`DocumentContext parsed = JsonPath.parse(json);`**: This line parses the input `json` string into a `DocumentContext` object, which represents the JSON document in a way that JsonPath can understand.

2.  **`String basePath = "$[*][?(@.id=='" + stationId + "')].properties";`**: This constructs a JsonPath expression that filters the JSON array to find the object with the matching `stationId`. It then navigates to the `properties` object within that matched object.

3.  **`String timeStamp = parsed.read(basePath + ".reference_ts");`**: This reads the value of the `reference_ts` field within the `properties` object using the JsonPath expression and parses it into a `Date` object representing the measurement timestamp. It uses `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_INSTANT` to parse the timestamp, which is assumed to be in ISO 8601 format.

4.  **`Double value1 = parsed.read(basePath + ".value");`**: This extracts the numerical value of the `value` field from the `properties` object. This likely represents the primary measurement (e.g., temperature, sunshine duration) for the station.

5.  **`Double value2 = null; if (value2Property != null) { value2 = parsed.read(basePath + "." + value2Property); }`**: This conditionally extracts a second numerical value, based on the `value2Property` argument. This allows the method to retrieve different secondary measurements depending on the context. For example, for wind gust data, this might be the wind direction. If `value2Property` is null, this value remains null.

The method returns a `ResDateValue` object, encapsulating the extracted `measurementDate`, `value1`, and `value2`, along with the station name. This object provides a convenient way to access the parsed data.
