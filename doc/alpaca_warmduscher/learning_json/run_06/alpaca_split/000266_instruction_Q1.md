For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.ts' with name 'utils-service.service.ts'... How does the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method handle cases where the calculated `desiredInterval` is *larger* than all the defined intervals in `standardIntervals`? What would be the return value in such a scenario, and why is that behavior chosen?
