`CrudRepository` provides a pre-built set of methods for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database entity. Benefits include reduced boilerplate code, faster development, and leveraging the power of Spring Data JPA's query generation capabilities.  It handles common database interactions without requiring explicit implementation of those methods.

However, there are scenarios where a custom repository is preferable.  For instance, if you require complex queries that cannot be easily expressed using derived query methods (like `findBy...`), or if you need to perform custom data validation or transformation before saving to the database, a custom repository is necessary.  Another example would be when dealing with highly specialized database operations or needing to optimize performance beyond what Spring Data JPA offers out of the box.  For example, if we were dealing with session requests and needed to implement a custom indexing strategy to improve query performance based on a specific date range, or needing to implement a sharding strategy for the `SessionRequest` entity, we would need a custom repository.  A custom repository allows you to write the SQL/JPQL directly for maximal control.
