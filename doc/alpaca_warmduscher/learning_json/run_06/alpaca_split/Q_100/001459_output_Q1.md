The `getBetweenDates` method has some complex logic around `maxRows` and `groupEveryNthSecond`.

**Potential Issues:**

*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** The code enforces mutual exclusivity: either `groupEveryNthSecond` *or* `maxRows` must be provided, but not both. This might be too restrictive. There could be valid use cases where a user wants to limit the results *and* have them aggregated by a fixed interval.
*   **Error Handling:** While the code throws a `ThException` for invalid combinations, the error messages are somewhat basic. More specific messages explaining *why* the combination is invalid would improve debugging.
*   **Default Values:** While the parameters have default values (-1), these defaults don't seem to be used in any meaningful way within the method's logic. The default values essentially make it impossible to call the method without specifying one of these parameters.
*   **Code Complexity:** The nested `if/else if` structure adds to the complexity. It could potentially be simplified using a more declarative approach.

**Improvements:**

*   **Relax Restrictions:** Allow both parameters to be specified, and handle them appropriately within the query. Perhaps the query could prioritize `maxRows` if both are present, or use both in conjunction if feasible.
*   **Improve Error Messages:** Provide more descriptive error messages that clearly explain the invalid parameter combination to the user.
*   **Consider a Strategy Pattern:** Using a Strategy Pattern could separate the logic for handling different query conditions (based on `maxRows` and `groupEveryNthSecond`) into separate classes, making the code more modular and maintainable.
*   **Default behavior:** Consider a default behavior when both `maxRows` and `groupEveryNthSecond` are not supplied.
