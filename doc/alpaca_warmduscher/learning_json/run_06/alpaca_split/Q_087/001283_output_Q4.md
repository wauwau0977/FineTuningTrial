```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.spring;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
@Component
public class StartupData {
   private long startupTimeTakenInMillis;

   // This class is designed to store the time taken during application startup.
   // It acts as a simple data holder for this specific metric.

   public long getStartupTimeTakenInMillis() {
       // This method returns the value of the 'startupTimeTakenInMillis' field, 
       // which represents the startup time in milliseconds.
       return startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   }

   public void setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis) {
       // This method sets the value of the 'startupTimeTakenInMillis' field.
       // It allows external components to record or update the startup time.
       this.startupTimeTakenInMillis = startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   }
}
```

The `@Component` annotation signifies that this class should be managed by the Spring framework. Spring will automatically detect and instantiate this class as a bean, making it available for dependency injection in other parts of the application. This allows other components to easily access and utilize the `StartupData` instance.
