The purpose of setting `this.cache[cacheKey] = null` when `evict` is true is to explicitly invalidate the cache entry for the given `cacheKey`.  This signals that any previously cached value is no longer valid and should be re-fetched.

The subsequent `if (this.cache[cacheKey] == null)` condition then detects this invalidation. Because the previous line set the value to `null`, the condition evaluates to `true`, triggering the loader function to fetch the data again. This is important because simply deleting the key from the `this.cache` object wouldn't reliably trigger a re-fetch if another part of the code was checking for the *existence* of the key (rather than its value being non-null).

The implication is that the `evict` parameter provides a mechanism for forceful cache invalidation.  If a component or service knows that data has become stale or incorrect, it can call `get` with `evict: true` to ensure that the next request for the same `cacheKey` always fetches fresh data. Using `null` instead of deleting the key offers a more predictable behavior for the conditional check.  Itâ€™s a common pattern for a cache to mark entries as invalid (using `null` or a similar marker) instead of physically removing them, so that the cache can still recognize the key and initiate a re-fetch when needed.
