For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass' with name 'styles.sass'... 
Looking at the following snippet:
```sass
.myLastSpace
  height: 100px
```
What is the likely purpose of this style rule, and in what kind of UI element or scenario would you expect to see it applied? What are potential drawbacks to using a fixed height like this, and how might you make this style more adaptable?
