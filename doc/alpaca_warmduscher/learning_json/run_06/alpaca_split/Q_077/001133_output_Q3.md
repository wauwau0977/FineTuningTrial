The `relativeHumidity` parameter represents the ratio of the amount of water vapor actually in the air to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature. Itâ€™s expressed as a percentage. In the function, it acts as a scaling factor to the saturation vapor pressure (calculated using the temperature and the exponential function). Essentially, it indicates how "full" the air is with water vapor relative to its capacity.

The `relativeHumidity` directly scales the calculated saturation vapor pressure. If the relative humidity is 100% (or 1.0), the absolute humidity will be equal to the maximum possible absolute humidity at that temperature. If the relative humidity is 50% (or 0.5), the absolute humidity will be half of the maximum possible absolute humidity at that temperature. Therefore, the `relativeHumidity` determines what *fraction* of the air's potential water vapor content is actually present.
