For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts'... 
The `emptyInstance()` method returns a new instance of `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` with default values. What are the potential implications of creating multiple instances of this "empty" entity, especially if these instances are used as a placeholder or default value in a larger system? Could this lead to any unexpected behavior or bugs?
