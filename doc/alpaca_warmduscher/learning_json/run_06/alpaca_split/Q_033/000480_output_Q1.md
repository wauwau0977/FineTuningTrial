The purpose of `static emptyInstance()` is to provide a consistent and centralized way to create a "default" or "empty" `HeatingEntity` object.  This is useful in scenarios where you need a placeholder object, for example:

*   **Initialization:** When initializing data structures that will later be populated with real data.
*   **Handling Null/Undefined Values:**  As a default value to return when data is missing or unavailable.
*   **Unit Tests:** To create a known state for testing purposes.

**Benefits compared to inline creation:**

*   **Consistency:** Ensures that all empty instances have the same default values, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Centralized Logic:**  All the default value logic is in one place, making it easier to maintain and update.
*   **Readability:**  Using a named method improves code readability compared to creating a complex object literal inline.

**Drawbacks:**

*   **Slight Overhead:** There's a small performance overhead associated with calling a method compared to creating an object literal inline.  This is usually negligible.
*   **Potential for Hidden Complexity:**  If the method becomes too complex, it can be harder to understand and maintain.  In this case, the method is fairly straightforward, so this isn't a major concern.

Overall, the benefits of providing a dedicated `emptyInstance()` method generally outweigh the drawbacks, especially in a larger application where consistency and maintainability are important.
