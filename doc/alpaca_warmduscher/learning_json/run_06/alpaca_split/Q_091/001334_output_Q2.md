The primary design consideration behind the conditional logging and the `isSessionRelevantRequest` check is to reduce unnecessary database writes and logging overhead for requests that are *not* intended to be tracked for session analysis.

It's important for several reasons:

1. **Performance:** Saving every single request to the database would add significant overhead, potentially impacting the application's performance. This is particularly true under high load.
2. **Database Space:** Persisting irrelevant requests would consume valuable database storage space.
3. **Data Clarity:** Only saving relevant requests keeps the data clean and focused on the intended purpose: analyzing user sessions and application behavior.
4. **Control over Data Collection:**  The `isSessionRelevantRequest` method provides a mechanism to selectively track specific types of requests.  This might be used for health checks, static resource requests (images, CSS, JavaScript), or other requests that are not part of core application workflows.

The conditional logging provides valuable insight into *what* requests are being excluded, aiding in debugging and ensuring the filter is functioning as expected.  It also highlights potential configuration issues or unexpected traffic patterns.
