For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadService.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadService.java' we have the following question: 

The `getData()` method is responsible for reading data from a Modbus device and populating a `HeatPumpEntity` object.  Describe the overall process, focusing on the sequence of operations performed to read the various data points (e.g., compressor hours, temperatures, discrete inputs).  Specifically, detail how the method utilizes the `modbusMasterSynced` object and the `readInputRegister`, `readDiscreteInputs` methods to retrieve data from specific registers and discrete inputs.  Also, explain the purpose of the `requestOperation` call on `modbusMasterSynced`.
