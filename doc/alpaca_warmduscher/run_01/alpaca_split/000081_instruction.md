You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This SASS stylesheet defines the visual styling for a fixed toolbar navigation component within the 'Warmduscher' application. It controls the background color, positioning, and layout of buttons and text within the toolbar, aiming for a consistent and user-friendly navigation experience. It uses flexbox to align items and ensures the toolbar is fixed to the bottom of the screen.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass`
- **Class Name(s):** `.toolbarNav`, `.toolbarText`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Defines the visual presentation of a fixed bottom toolbar.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This stylesheet doesn't directly handle user inputs. It *outputs* visual styling for the toolbar, which is rendered by the browser based on underlying application logic.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The stylesheet applies CSS rules to elements with specific class names to achieve a particular visual layout.  The flexbox layout aligns buttons and text horizontally. The `position: fixed` property ensures the toolbar remains visible at the bottom of the viewport.
- **External Interactions**:  None. This file solely concerns visual styling.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  The stylesheet doesn't explicitly handle edge cases. Responsiveness to different screen sizes would be managed by the application’s overall layout and potentially through media queries (not present in this snippet).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal impact.  SASS is compiled to CSS, which is cached by the browser.  The rules themselves are relatively simple.
- **Scalability**:  The stylesheet is not a scalability concern.
- **Security**:  No direct security implications.
- **Maintainability**: Moderate.  The use of classes makes it relatively easy to modify the appearance, but the `margin-left: -7px` hack suggests potential underlying layout issues that could make future changes more difficult.
- **Reliability & Availability**: N/A. Styling does not affect reliability or availability.
- **Usability**:  Contributes to usability by providing a clear and consistent bottom navigation bar.
- **Compliance**:  N/A.

## 5. Key Components

- **`.toolbarNav`**:  Defines the overall styling of the toolbar container, including background color, fixed positioning, z-index, and flexbox layout.
- **`.toolbarText`**: Defines the line height and margin for text within the toolbar.
- **Button Styling**: Styles buttons within the toolbar to be flex containers, aligning items vertically and setting width to 100%.
- **`margin-left: -7px`**: A hack/workaround to adjust the toolbar's position.
- **Error handling**: N/A.
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: N/A.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **SASS Syntax**: Uses SASS nesting and variable definitions.
- **CSS Selectors**:  Uses standard CSS selectors (class names, descendant selectors).
- **CSS Properties**: Utilizes standard CSS properties (e.g., `background-color`, `position`, `display`, `justify-content`, `padding`, `border`, `margin`, `line-height`).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **SASS Compiler**: The code relies on a SASS compiler to transform SASS syntax into standard CSS.  (e.g. dart-sass)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None identified within this file.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** The stylesheet is already relatively efficient. No major performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- **Code Readability:**  The `margin-left: -7px` hack should be investigated and replaced with a more robust solution. Ideally, the underlying layout issues should be addressed to eliminate the need for the hack.  Comments could be added to explain the intention behind any non-obvious styling choices.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Not applicable.  Styling itself doesn’t impact scalability. Consider the overall application layout and responsiveness to different screen sizes to ensure scalability.
- **Responsiveness:**  No media queries are present. Adding media queries could improve the user experience on different screen sizes.
