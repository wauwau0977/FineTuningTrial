The `jacksonFactory` is an instance of Google's Jackson library, a popular Java library for processing JSON. In this context, it's used to convert the incoming `rawData` (which is a JSON string) into a Java object of type `GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest`.

The code performs the following steps:

1.  `jacksonFactory.createJsonParser(rawData)`: Creates a JSON parser from the `rawData` string.
2.  `.parse(GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest.class)`:  Uses the JSON parser to deserialize (or "unmarshal") the JSON data from the string into a Java object of the specified class `GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest`.  This process converts the JSON data into a structured Java object that the code can then work with.

Essentially, this line parses the JSON request sent by Dialogflow and turns it into a usable Java object.
