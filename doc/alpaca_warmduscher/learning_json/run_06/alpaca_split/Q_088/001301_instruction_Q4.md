For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java' we have the following question: 
Describe the purpose of the `init` and `destroy` methods in the `CorsFilter` class.  Explain why they are included even though they are currently empty. What role do these methods play in the lifecycle of a filter within a servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty?
