The `EmailService` class utilizes three Spring annotations: `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ResponseBody`.

`@Controller`: This annotation marks the `EmailService` class as a Spring MVC controller. It signals to the Spring container that this class handles incoming web requests and should be managed as a component.

`@RequestMapping("/email")`: This annotation is used at the class level and maps all request paths starting with `/email` to this controller. It defines the base URL for the controller's endpoints.

`@RequestMapping("/send")`: This annotation is used at the method level within the `send` method. Combined with the class-level `@RequestMapping("/email")`, it maps requests to the `/email/send` URL to this specific method.

`@ResponseBody`: This annotation indicates that the return value of the `send` method should be written directly to the HTTP response body. Spring will automatically handle the conversion of the return value (in this case, a String) into the appropriate response content type (e.g., `text/plain`). It essentially bypasses the need for a view resolver and template engine.

In summary, these annotations work together to define a RESTful endpoint that handles email sending requests. The Spring framework uses these annotations to route incoming requests to the appropriate method and handle the response appropriately.
