The component utilizes Angular Materialâ€™s Flex Layout (fxLayout) to manage the layout of the temperature data. Specifically, `fxLayout.xs="column"` and `fxLayout.gt-xs="row"` are used on a `<div>` element. This dictates that on extra small screens (xs), the content within that div will be arranged in a column (one below the other). On screens larger than extra small (gt-xs), the content will be arranged in a row (side-by-side).

Furthermore, `fxFlex.gt-xs="50"` is applied to both temperature divs, meaning that on larger screens, each div will occupy 50% of the available horizontal space.  The `class="spacer"` also likely adds some visual separation.

This approach provides responsiveness by adapting the layout based on screen size.  On mobile devices, the temperatures are stacked vertically for easier readability. On larger screens, they are displayed side-by-side for a more compact view.
