For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplicationTests.java' with name 'ThserverApplicationTests.java'... 
This test class currently lacks any actual assertions. Assuming the 'ThserverApplication' exposes a REST endpoint at `/api/health`, how would you add a test to verify that this endpoint returns an HTTP 200 OK status code? Include the necessary imports and a snippet of test code using `TestRestTemplate`.
