For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataService.java' with name 'MeteoDataService.java'... 
Imagine you need to extend this service to support multiple data sources (e.g., MeteoSwiss and a second provider, Wetter.com). How would you modify the interface and its implementations to achieve this extensibility without significantly altering existing code? Consider using design patterns.
