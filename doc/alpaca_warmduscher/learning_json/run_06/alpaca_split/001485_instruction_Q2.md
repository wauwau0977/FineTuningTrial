For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplicationTests.java' with name 'ThserverApplicationTests.java'... 
Imagine the 'ThserverApplication' utilizes a specific database connection. How would you configure this test class to use an in-memory H2 database for testing purposes instead of connecting to a production or development database? Provide the application.properties or application.yml configuration that would be necessary.
