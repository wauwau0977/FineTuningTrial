`TestBed.configureTestingModule` is used to bootstrap a testing module that mimics the environment in which the component would run in a real application. It allows us to declare which components, directives, pipes, and services are available for the test. It essentially sets up the dependency injection container for testing purposes.

`fixture.detectChanges()` triggers Angular's change detection mechanism. This is crucial because after setting up the component instance (`component = fixture.componentInstance`), the view isn't automatically updated to reflect any initial state or data bound to the template. `detectChanges()` forces Angular to check for changes in the component's data and update the displayed view accordingly.

If `fixture.detectChanges()` is omitted, the component's view will not be initialized correctly.  Specifically:

*   **Initial Data Binding Won't Happen:** If the component template uses data binding (e.g., `{{ someVariable }}`), the view won't display the initial value of `someVariable` because the binding hasn't been evaluated.
*   **Templates May Remain Empty:** Any parts of the template that rely on the component's logic or data will not be rendered.
*   **Tests Could Fail:** If your tests rely on the rendered output of the component, they will likely fail because the view is not initialized.  Even a simple assertion like checking for the presence of an element in the DOM would likely fail.
*   **Potential for Unexpected Behavior:**  Although unlikely in this basic example, more complex components with lifecycle hooks might not function as expected if change detection isn't triggered.
