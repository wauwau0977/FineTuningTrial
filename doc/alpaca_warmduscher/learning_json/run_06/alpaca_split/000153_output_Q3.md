The `myFullPageRefresh()` method is a simple function that forces a full page reload of the browser window using `window.location.reload()`. This essentially restarts the application from scratch, fetching all resources and re-rendering the entire UI.

The `interval` observable, combined with the `.subscribe()` method, creates a recurring timer. The `interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000)` generates a new value every `environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds` seconds (multiplied by 1000 to convert seconds to milliseconds).  Each time the interval emits a value, the callback function within the `.subscribe()` method is executed. This callback logs a message to the console and then calls the `this.myFullPageRefresh()` method, initiating a full page reload.

Potential drawbacks of this approach include:

*   **Poor User Experience:**  A full page reload disrupts the user experience by clearing any user input, losing application state (e.g., scroll position, form data), and potentially causing flicker.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Re-fetching all resources and re-rendering the entire UI is resource-intensive and can lead to performance issues, especially for complex applications.
*   **Loss of State:** Any data held in the component that isn't persisted (e.g., to local storage or a server) will be lost on each reload.
*   **Inefficiency:**  It's unlikely that *everything* on the page needs to be refreshed at the same interval.  A more efficient approach would be to identify specific data or components that need updating and refresh only those parts of the UI using techniques like AJAX or component re-rendering.  Using a full page refresh is generally considered an anti-pattern in modern web development.
