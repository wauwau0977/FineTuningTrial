For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
double ah = Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation(20, 90);
System.out.println(ah);
```
What is the purpose of the `System.out.println(ah);` statement within the test? Is it essential for the test to pass or fail, and why might it be included despite this?
