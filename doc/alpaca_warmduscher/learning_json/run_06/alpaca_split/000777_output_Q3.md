The `seq_id` column is derived using a window function to identify and group measurements that belong to the same compressor cycle.  It's calculated as `row_number() over ( order by measurement_date) - row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date)`. This formula effectively creates a unique identifier for each continuous period where the compressor state (`di10compressor1`) changes.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

*   `row_number() over (order by measurement_date)` assigns a sequential number to each measurement based on its timestamp.
*   `row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date)` restarts the sequence for each change in `di10compressor1`.
*   The difference between these two row numbers results in `seq_id`. This value will be consistent for all measurements within the same compressor cycle and will change when the compressor turns on or off.

The `seq_id` is crucial for filtering data to exclude startup and shutdown phases of the compressor.  The query filters to include only measurements after the compressor has been running for a minimum duration and to exclude measurements shortly before it shuts off, ensuring that the statistics reflect stable operating conditions.
