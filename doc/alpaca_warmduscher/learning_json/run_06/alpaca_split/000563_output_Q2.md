Data is being passed from this HTML component to the `app-boiler-chart` component using **input properties**. `[overviewMode]="true"` is Angular's **property binding** syntax.  It binds the value of the `overviewMode` variable (which must be defined in the parent component - likely the `overview-current.component.ts` file) to the `overviewMode` input property of the `app-boiler-chart` component. This means the `app-boiler-chart` component can receive and use the boolean value of `overviewMode` to control its rendering or behavior.  This is a one-way data flow â€“ data flows from the parent component *to* the child component.

The `class="standAlone"` attribute is used for **styling**. It applies CSS rules defined for the `.standAlone` class to the `app-boiler-chart` component's element. This is likely used to provide specific styling to this instance of the chart component to differentiate it from other potential instances in the application, or to provide specific layout requirements. It's a standard HTML way of applying CSS styles to an element. It does not pass any data to the `app-boiler-chart` component.
