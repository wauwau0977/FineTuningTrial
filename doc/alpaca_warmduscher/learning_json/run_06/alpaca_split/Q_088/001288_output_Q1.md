The `Filter` interface in a Java Servlet environment has three main lifecycle methods: `init()`, `doFilter()`, and `destroy()`.

*   `init(FilterConfig filterConfig)`: This method is called only once when the filter is initialized. It's used to perform any setup tasks, such as reading configuration parameters. In this `CorsFilter`, the `init()` method is overridden but does nothing, indicating no specific initialization is required.

*   `doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)`: This method is called by the container for each request that the filter is mapped to. It contains the core logic of the filter. The `doFilter()` method in `CorsFilter` adds the necessary CORS headers to the response and then calls `chain.doFilter(request, response)` to pass the request along to the next filter in the chain or to the target servlet.

*   `destroy()`: This method is called only once when the filter is being shut down. It's used to release any resources that were allocated during initialization. In this `CorsFilter`, the `destroy()` method is overridden but does nothing, indicating no resource cleanup is necessary.

Essentially, the container manages the lifecycle of the filter, calling these methods at the appropriate times.  This `CorsFilter` primarily focuses on the `doFilter()` method for handling the CORS logic.
