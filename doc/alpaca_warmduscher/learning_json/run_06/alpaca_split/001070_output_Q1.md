The `GlobalSynced` class seems to be a custom synchronization mechanism designed to safely manage access to the `ModbusMaster` object, especially in a potentially multi-threaded environment. It wraps the `ModbusMaster` and utilizes the provided `Hooks` object to ensure that certain actions (connecting/disconnecting) are performed consistently around the core operation.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Purpose:** It provides thread-safe access to the `ModbusMaster` instance. The core idea is to ensure that only one thread can access and operate on the Modbus master at any given time, preventing potential conflicts or data corruption.
*   **Interaction with `modbusMasterSynced`:** The `modbusMasterSynced` object is an instance of `GlobalSynced` and holds a reference to the `ModbusMaster` and the `modBusMasterHooks`. The `requestOperation` method on `modbusMasterSynced` is the crucial point. It allows you to submit a lambda expression (a piece of code) that will operate on the `ModbusMaster`.  `GlobalSynced` internally handles synchronizing access, executing the `before` hook, running the lambda, executing the `after` hook, and releasing the resource.
*   **Why it's used instead of directly accessing the `ModbusMaster`:** Directly accessing `ModbusMaster` in a multi-threaded environment could lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior. `GlobalSynced` abstracts away the complexity of synchronization, ensuring thread-safe access to the Modbus master. This pattern promotes code reliability and prevents potential issues arising from concurrent modifications or operations on the Modbus connection. It encapsulates the synchronization logic, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
