These elements are part of Angular Material, a UI component library that implements Google's Material Design specification. They provide a structured way to present the gauge chart with a consistent and visually appealing design.

`<mat-card>`: This element acts as a container for the entire gauge chart section. It provides a slight elevation (shadow) and rounded corners, visually separating the chart from the rest of the application's UI. It defines a distinct "card" that groups related content.

`<mat-card-content>`: This element contains the actual gauge chart (the `<highcharts-chart>` tag).  It provides padding around the chart, creating visual space and preventing the chart from touching the edges of the card. It's the primary area where the chart content is displayed.

`<mat-card-footer>`: This element is intended for additional information or actions related to the gauge chart. In this case, itâ€™s currently empty, but it could potentially contain labels, buttons, or links. It provides a consistent area at the bottom of the card for related elements, maintaining a clean and structured layout.

By using these Angular Material elements, the component benefits from a pre-defined Material Design aesthetic, ensuring consistency and a polished look. They provide a structured layout for organizing the chart and related elements, improving the user experience.
