You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This specification details the `CacheService` class within the 'Warmduscher' project. The `CacheService` is an Angular service primarily intended to provide a caching mechanism for application data. The provided test spec solely verifies the service's instantiation; it doesn’t define any caching functionalities. This specification will assume a basic caching implementation based on the service name and typical caching service behavior.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `CacheService`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations:** The service is designed to store and retrieve data, acting as a cache to reduce the need for repeated data fetching.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Input:** Key-value pairs, where the key uniquely identifies the cached data, and the value is the data itself.
    - **Output:** The cached value associated with a given key. If the key is not found, it returns `null` or an equivalent indicator.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1.  `set(key, value)`: Stores the `value` associated with the `key` in the cache.
    2.  `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the `key` from the cache.  If the key doesn't exist, it returns a null or a designated "not found" indicator.
    3.  `invalidate(key)`: Removes the entry associated with the `key` from the cache.
    4.  `clear()`: Removes all entries from the cache.
- **External Interactions:** None currently apparent from the provided code, but could involve interactions with a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., local storage, a database) in a full implementation.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - **Key Collision:** Handling of duplicate keys (e.g., overwriting the existing value or throwing an error).
    - **Invalid Key:** Handling of invalid or unsupported key types.
    - **Cache Full:** If the cache has a limited size, handle scenarios where adding new data would exceed that limit (e.g., evicting older entries).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Fast retrieval and storage of data are crucial. Cache access should be significantly faster than fetching data from the original source.
- **Scalability:** The service should be able to handle a growing amount of cached data without significant performance degradation.
- **Security:** If caching sensitive data, appropriate security measures should be implemented (e.g., encryption).
- **Maintainability:** The code should be well-structured, modular, and easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The caching mechanism should be robust and not cause application crashes or data loss.
- **Usability:** The service should have a simple and intuitive API for developers to use.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions:**
    - `set(key, value)`: Stores data in the cache.
    - `get(key)`: Retrieves data from the cache.
    - `invalidate(key)`: Removes data from the cache.
    - `clear()`: Clears the entire cache.
- **Important logic flows:**
    - Data storage:  Mapping keys to values, potentially with eviction policies.
    - Data retrieval:  Searching the cache based on the key.
- **Error handling:**  Handling invalid keys, cache full scenarios, and potential storage errors.
- **Classes:** `CacheService` – potentially with subclasses for different caching strategies (e.g., in-memory, local storage, database).
- **Modules:** The service likely resides within a dedicated 'cache' module within the Angular application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures (Maps or Objects to store key-value pairs).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular:** The service is an Angular service, so it depends on Angular core modules.
- **@angular/core/testing:** Used for the unit tests.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- No internal project dependencies apparent from the provided code snippet.  However, it's likely to depend on other services or components within the 'Warmduscher' application.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements:** Consider using a more efficient data structure for the cache (e.g., a hash map). Implement caching expiration policies to prevent stale data.
- **Code Readability:**  Add comments to explain the purpose of each function and the overall logic.
- **Security Improvements:** If caching sensitive data, consider encrypting the cached values.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  If the cache needs to handle a large amount of data, consider using a distributed caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached).  Implement a cache eviction policy (LRU, FIFO, etc.) to limit memory usage.
- **Implement Caching Strategy:** The current test does not define a caching strategy. Implementing a strategy will improve the functionality of the CacheService.
