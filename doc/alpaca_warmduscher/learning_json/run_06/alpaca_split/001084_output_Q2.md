The `INDEXES` static initializer block creates an array that serves as a lookup table for base58 characters. It initializes all elements to -1, and then iterates through the `ALPHABET` array, assigning each character's index within `ALPHABET` to the corresponding element in `INDEXES`.  Essentially, `INDEXES['A']` would be the index of 'A' within the `ALPHABET` array, and so on.

Within the `decode` method, the `INDEXES` array is used to validate the input characters. For each character in the input string, it checks if the character exists in the `ALPHABET` by looking up its value in the `INDEXES` array. If `INDEXES[c]` returns -1, it means the character `c` is not a valid base58 character, and a `RuntimeException` is thrown.

If the `INDEXES` array were not initialized, it would contain all -1 values. This would mean that *every* character in the input string would be considered invalid, and the `decode` method would always throw a `RuntimeException`. The method would not be able to correctly decode any base58 string.
