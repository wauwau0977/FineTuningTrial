In a production environment, I would implement several error handling and input validation considerations when calling the `getLastEntries` method:

*   **`stationId` Validation:**
    *   **Null or Empty Check:**  Ensure `stationId` is not null or empty. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` or a custom exception if it is.
    *   **Format Validation:**  Validate the format of `stationId` to ensure it matches the expected format (e.g., a specific pattern or length).  This prevents invalid data from reaching the database.
*   **`maxRows` Validation:**
    *   **Positive Integer Check:** Ensure `maxRows` is a positive integer. A negative or zero value could lead to unexpected behavior or database errors. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if invalid.
    *   **Maximum Value Limit:** Consider limiting the maximum value of `maxRows` to prevent excessive data retrieval and potential performance issues or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Exception Handling:**
    *   **Database Connection Errors:** Handle potential database connection errors (e.g., `SQLException`) gracefully. Log the error and return a meaningful error message to the client.
    *   **Data Access Exceptions:** Handle any data access exceptions that might occur during the query execution.
    *   **Generic Exception Handling:** Implement a generic exception handler to catch unexpected exceptions and prevent the application from crashing.
*   **Logging:** Log the method call with the input parameters (`stationId`, `maxRows`) and the time taken to execute the query. This will help with monitoring and debugging.
*   **Caching:** Consider implementing caching to reduce the number of database queries, especially if the `getLastEntries` method is called frequently with the same `stationId` and `maxRows`.
*   **Circuit Breaker:** Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures if the database is unavailable or slow to respond.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of the `getLastEntries` method and set up alerts if the response time exceeds a certain threshold.
