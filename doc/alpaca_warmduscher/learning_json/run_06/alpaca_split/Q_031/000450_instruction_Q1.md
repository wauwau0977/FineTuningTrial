For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts'... What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a class like `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` to represent this data? Could this data be represented effectively using a simple interface or just a plain JavaScript object?
