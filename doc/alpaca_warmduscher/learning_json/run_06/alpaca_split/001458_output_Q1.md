The class `MeteoSwissService` uses constructor-based dependency injection. This is evident from the constructor: `public MeteoSwissService(MeteoSwissRepository meteoSwissRepository, MeteoSwissStatsRepository meteoSwissStatsRepository)`.  The `MeteoSwissRepository` and `MeteoSwissStatsRepository` are injected as dependencies rather than being instantiated within the class itself.

Benefits:

*   **Testability:** This allows for easy mocking of dependencies during unit testing.  We can inject mock repositories into the service to isolate the logic of `MeteoSwissService` from the actual database interactions. This leads to faster, more reliable, and focused tests.
*   **Maintainability:** Loose coupling between the service and the repositories promotes maintainability. Changes to the repository implementations won't necessarily require changes to the service, as long as the interfaces remain consistent. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **Reusability:** The dependencies can be easily swapped with different implementations, enabling code reuse in different contexts or with different data sources.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** The class focuses on its core responsibility—providing data related to MeteoSwiss—delegating data access to the injected repositories.
