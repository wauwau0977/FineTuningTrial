To conditionally add the client ID header, I would add a check within the `intercept` method based on the request URL or method. Here's how I'd approach it:

```typescript
intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
  let clientId = this.clientIdService.getClientId();
  let clientVersion = environment.buildTimestampClient;

  // Example: Only add the headers for POST requests to '/api/data'
  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url.endsWith('/api/data')) {
    const modifiedReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers
        .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID, clientId)
        .set(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION, clientVersion)
    });
    return next.handle(modifiedReq);
  }

  // If the condition is not met, pass the original request through
  return next.handle(req);
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Conditional Check:** I added an `if` statement to check if the request method is `POST` and the URL ends with `/api/data`.  You could easily adjust this condition to match any specific URL pattern or request method you need.
2.  **Conditional Cloning:** If the condition is met, the code clones the request, adds the headers, and returns the modified request.
3.  **Passing the Original Request:** If the condition is *not* met, the code simply returns `next.handle(req)`, passing the original request through without modification.

This approach allows you to selectively apply the client ID header to specific requests, providing more granular control over your application's behavior. You could extend this logic to support multiple conditions or more complex URL matching using regular expressions.
