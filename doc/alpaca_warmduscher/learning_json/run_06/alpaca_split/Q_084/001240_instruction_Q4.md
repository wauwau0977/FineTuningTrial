For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java' with name 'Hooks.java' we have the following question: 
Imagine you are implementing a mutex lock using this `Hooks` interface. Describe how you would design a class that implements this interface to log entry and exit events from a specific protected section of code. The logging should include a timestamp and an identifier for the protected resource. Explain the implementation details, specifically how you'd handle potential exceptions within the `before` and `after` methods.
