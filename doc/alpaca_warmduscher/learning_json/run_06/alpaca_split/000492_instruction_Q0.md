You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a data class `MeteoSwissEntity` representing weather data received from the MeteoSwiss service. It encapsulates data like temperature, wind speed, station information, and associated date ranges. The class provides methods for creating instances, including an empty instance and instances parsed from web service responses.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Represent weather data from MeteoSwiss.
    - Provide a default/empty instance of the entity.
    - Create an instance from data received from a web service.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** Raw data from the MeteoSwiss web service (object `data`).
    - **Output:** `MeteoSwissEntity` object containing parsed weather data, or an empty `MeteoSwissEntity` object if the input data is invalid or null.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - The constructor initializes the `MeteoSwissEntity` object with provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()` returns a `MeteoSwissEntity` with default/empty values.
    - `ofWebService()` takes raw data as input, handles null values, and creates and returns a populated `MeteoSwissEntity` object, applying date conversions using the `HeatingDataService`.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Calls the `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` method to convert date strings from the web service into `Date` objects.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - `ofWebService()` handles null input data by returning an empty instance.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Creation of instances should be relatively fast, as it mainly involves assigning values to class properties.
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and easy to understand, contributing to good maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class itself does not directly impact system availability. Its reliability depends on the reliability of the `HeatingDataService` and the accuracy of the data it receives from MeteoSwiss.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `constructor()`: Initializes the `MeteoSwissEntity` instance.
    - `emptyInstance()`: Returns a new, empty `MeteoSwissEntity` instance.
    - `ofWebService(data: any)`: Creates an instance from web service data, handling null values and date conversion.
- **Important logic flows**:
    - The `ofWebService` method handles null data and converts dates.
- **Error handling**:
    - Handles null data in `ofWebService` by returning an empty instance.
- **Classes**:
    - `MeteoSwissEntity`: The main data class. No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is part of the `app.entities` module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures: Primitive data types (string, number, Date)
- Object-oriented programming: Classes and object instantiation.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None explicitly used in this class itself.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- `HeatingDataService`: Used for date conversion.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** No major performance bottlenecks are apparent in this code.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable in this code.
- **Scalability Considerations:** No direct scalability concerns with this class.  Scalability would be dependent on the `HeatingDataService` and the MeteoSwiss service.
- **Date Handling:** Consider using a more robust date/time library (e.g., Moment.js, date-fns) if more complex date manipulations are needed.
- **Type Safety**: Consider leveraging TypeScript's typing features more rigorously to ensure data consistency and prevent runtime errors. For example, using specific types for the properties.
