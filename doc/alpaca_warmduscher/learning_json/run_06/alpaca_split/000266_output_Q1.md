In the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method, if the calculated `desiredInterval` is larger than all intervals in `standardIntervals`, the code iterates through the intervals without finding a match where `interval.intervalInSeconds > desiredInterval`. Consequently, the loop completes, and the method returns `defaultInterval`, which is `intervals[0]` (the smallest interval).  This behavior is chosen to ensure that a valid interval is *always* returned.  Returning the smallest interval in such a case provides a reasonable fallback, preventing errors or unexpected behavior further down the line. While it might not be the *ideal* interval for the given data point count, it guarantees data collection will happen, albeit at a higher frequency than potentially desired.
