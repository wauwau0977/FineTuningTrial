To correctly locate and load the test files now located in the `tests/unit` subdirectory, you would need to modify the first argument of the `require.context` call.  Instead of `'./'`, you would specify the relative path to the `tests/unit` directory.

The modified line would be:

```typescript
const context = require.context('./tests/unit', true, /\.spec\.ts$/);
```

**Explanation:**

*   `'./tests/unit'`:  This tells `require.context` to start searching for files in the `tests/unit` directory, relative to the current file (`test.ts`).  The `./` indicates that the search should begin in the same directory as `test.ts`.  Then, `tests/unit` specifies the subdirectory to search within.

The other arguments (`true` for recursive searching and `/\.spec\.ts$/` for the file pattern) remain unchanged because the requirement to recursively search the subdirectory and only include files ending in `.spec.ts` is still valid.  This change ensures that `require.context` correctly finds and loads all the unit test files located in the new directory structure, enabling the tests to run as expected.
