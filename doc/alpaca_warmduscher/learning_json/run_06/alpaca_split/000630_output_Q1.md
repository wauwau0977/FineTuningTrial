Handling dynamic `serviceBaseURL` changes requires careful consideration of how and when the changes are applied and how to ensure a smooth user experience. Here are a few approaches:

1.  **Feature Flags/Remote Configuration:** The most robust approach. Implement a remote configuration service (e.g., LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat) or a feature flag system.  The application would periodically (or via a WebSocket connection) check this service for the current `serviceBaseURL`. This allows for zero-downtime switches and A/B testing of different service endpoints.

2.  **Runtime Configuration File:**  The application could load a configuration file (e.g., JSON) from a remote server at startup or periodically. This file would contain the current `serviceBaseURL`.  This is simpler than a feature flag system but requires a mechanism to invalidate the cache when the configuration changes.

3.  **Service Discovery:** If the backend services are running in a dynamic environment (e.g., Kubernetes), use a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, etcd).  The application would query the service discovery system to obtain the current address of the backend service.

4.  **Event-Driven Approach (WebSockets/Server-Sent Events):** The backend could push updates to the `serviceBaseURL` to the client via a WebSocket connection or Server-Sent Events (SSE).  This allows for real-time updates without the need for polling.

**Considerations:**

*   **Caching:** Cache the `serviceBaseURL` to minimize the number of requests to the remote configuration service.  However, ensure the cache is invalidated when the configuration changes.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors when fetching the configuration.  Provide a fallback mechanism if the remote configuration service is unavailable.
*   **User Experience:** Minimize the disruption to the user experience when the `serviceBaseURL` changes.  Consider displaying a message to the user if the service is temporarily unavailable.
*   **Security:**  Ensure the remote configuration service is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the dynamic `serviceBaseURL` functionality to ensure it works as expected in different scenarios.
