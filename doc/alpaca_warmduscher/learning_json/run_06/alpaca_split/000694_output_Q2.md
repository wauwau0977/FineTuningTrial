Calling `meteoDataService.init()` inside the constructor can lead to several potential issues:

1.  **Tight Coupling:** It creates a strong dependency between `MeteoDataPoller` and the initialization logic of `MeteoDataService`. If `MeteoDataService`'s initialization becomes complex or requires external resources, it tightly couples `MeteoDataPoller` to these requirements.

2.  **Potential for Failure during Construction:** If `meteoDataService.init()` fails, the `MeteoDataPoller` object will not be fully constructed, potentially leading to application startup failures or unexpected behavior.

3.  **Spring Lifecycle Conflicts:** Spring manages the lifecycle of beans. Performing initialization within the constructor might bypass Spring's bean initialization mechanisms (e.g., `@PostConstruct` or `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()`).

To address these concerns, I would refactor the code as follows:

1.  **Use `@PostConstruct`:** Annotate a dedicated method within `MeteoDataPoller` with `@PostConstruct`. This method will be called after Spring has fully constructed and injected dependencies into the bean.

    ```java
    @Component
    public class MeteoDataPoller {
        private final MeteoDataService meteoDataService;
        private final MeteoSwissRepository meteoSwissRepository;

        public MeteoDataPoller(MeteoDataService meteoDataService, MeteoSwissRepository meteoSwissRepository) {
            this.meteoDataService = meteoDataService;
            this.meteoSwissRepository = meteoSwissRepository;
        }

        @PostConstruct
        public void init() {
            meteoDataService.init();
            log.info("Did init MeteoDataService " + meteoDataService.getClass().getSimpleName());
        }
    }
    ```

This refactoring decouples the initialization logic from the constructor, allows Spring to manage the bean lifecycle correctly, and improves the overall design.
