For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/ThException.java' with name 'ThException.java'...
Considering that `ThException` extends `RuntimeException`, and assuming it's widely used within 'Warmduscher', what potential downsides could this design choice introduce regarding code maintainability and testability, and how would you mitigate these risks?
