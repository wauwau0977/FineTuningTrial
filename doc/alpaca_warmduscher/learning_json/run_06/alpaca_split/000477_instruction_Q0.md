You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a `HeatingEntity` class in TypeScript. This class serves as a data container for heating system measurement data. It encapsulates various temperature readings, compressor hours, pump statuses, and error codes. The class provides static methods to create instances from scratch (empty instance) or from data retrieved from a web service.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/heatingEntity.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Represents heating system data.
    - Provides methods for creating instances with default or web service data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: Data from a web service (object), or default values for initialization.
    - **Outputs**: An instance of the `HeatingEntity` class containing the data.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The constructor initializes the `HeatingEntity` object with provided data.
    2. `emptyInstance()` creates a default instance with null or zero values.
    3. `ofWebService()` creates an instance from a web service response object. It handles null responses by returning an empty instance.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Calls `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` to convert the `measurementDate` from the web service data into a Date object.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - `ofWebService()` handles the case where the web service returns null data by returning an `emptyInstance()`.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The class instantiation and data access are expected to be fast, as it's a simple data container.
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The class itself doesn't have inherent reliability or availability concerns, but its correct operation relies on the `HeatingDataService` and the data it receives.
- **Usability**: The class is designed to be easily integrated into other parts of the application for accessing and manipulating heating data.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - **`constructor( ... )`**: Initializes the `HeatingEntity` with provided values.
    - **`emptyInstance()`**: Creates and returns a new `HeatingEntity` with default/empty values.
    - **`ofWebService(data: any)`**: Creates a `HeatingEntity` from data received from a web service, handling null data gracefully.
- **Important Logic Flows**:
    - Data initialization via constructor.
    - Creation of empty instance for default values.
    - Web service data parsing and object creation.
- **Error Handling**:
    - The `ofWebService` method handles null web service responses by returning an empty instance, preventing errors.
- **Classes**:
    - `HeatingEntity` is a simple data class with no subclasses.
- **Modules**: No explicit module structure within the code snippet itself.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures**: Uses primitive data types (string, number, Date).
- **Object-oriented programming**: Uses class definition and instantiation.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None within the provided code snippet.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`HeatingDataService`**:  Used for date conversion.  The code depends on the functionality within this service to transform incoming data to the correct type.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**: None immediately apparent, the class is relatively lightweight.
- **Code Readability**: The constructor has a long parameter list. Consider using an object destructuring approach if the web service data is consistently structured, to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Security Improvements**:  The code itself doesn’t directly handle security. Security considerations would be related to how the data is transmitted and processed by the web service.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  As the class is a data container, scalability concerns depend on how it’s used and the scale of the heating data being processed. Consider pagination or batch processing if dealing with a large number of heating data points.
- **Type Safety**: Consider using a more strongly typed approach for the web service data. Using an interface or type definition for the expected data structure could improve code reliability and catch potential errors during development.
