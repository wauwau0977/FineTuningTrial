For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(10), 10);
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(11), 11);
