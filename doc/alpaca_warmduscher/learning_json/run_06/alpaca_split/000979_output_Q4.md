Hereâ€™s a design for a data processing pipeline utilizing the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface:

**Stage 1: Raw Data Ingestion & Aggregation**

*   **Input:** Raw sensor readings (e.g., inflow and outflow rates, compressor status) from multiple sensors, timestamped and potentially in different formats.
*   **Processing Logic:**
    *   Data is ingested from various sources (e.g., message queues, databases).
    *   Data is validated and transformed into a consistent format.
    *   Data is grouped by a defined time window (e.g., 5-minute intervals).
    *   For each time window, the following calculations are performed:
        *   Average inflow and outflow.
        *   Minimum and maximum inflow and outflow.
        *   Compressor state (determined by the dominant state during the window).
        *   Total number of probes (sensor readings) within the window.
        *   Calculate `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`, and `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax` based on inflow/outflow differences.
*   **Output:**  A stream of `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` objects, each representing data aggregated for a specific time window.  This could be published to another message queue or persisted to a temporary data store.

**Stage 2: Statistical Analysis & Anomaly Detection**

*   **Input:** Stream of `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` objects from Stage 1.
*   **Processing Logic:**
    *   For each `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` object, perform statistical analysis:
        *   Calculate rolling averages and standard deviations of the delta values over a longer time window (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).
        *   Apply anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., using standard deviation thresholds or machine learning models) to identify unusual patterns in the delta values. This might flag unexpected increases or decreases in the delta, or compressor behavior that doesn't align with expectations.
    *   Add anomaly flags/scores to the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` object.
*   **Output:**  Enhanced `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` objects with anomaly flags/scores. This could be persisted to a database optimized for analytical queries (e.g., a time-series database) or published to a dashboarding system.

**Stage 3: Reporting & Visualization**

*   **Input:**  Enhanced `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` objects from Stage 2, stored in a time-series database.
*   **Processing Logic:**
    *   Query the database to retrieve data for specific time ranges and sensors.
    *   Generate reports and visualizations (e.g., line charts showing delta values over time, heatmaps showing sensor performance, alerts for detected anomalies).
    *   Provide interactive dashboards for users to explore the data and identify trends.
*   **Output:**  Reports, visualizations, and alerts presented to users through a web interface or other channels.  This allows stakeholders to monitor sensor performance, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions.

This pipeline allows for a flexible and scalable way to process data represented by the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface, from raw sensor readings to actionable insights. Each stage is decoupled, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.
