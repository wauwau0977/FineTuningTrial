Including build timestamps in the UI has both benefits and drawbacks:

**Benefits:**

* **Debugging & Support:**  Extremely valuable for debugging issues and providing support. When a user reports a problem, knowing the exact client and server build versions allows for precise identification of the code running on their system.
* **Version Tracking:** Provides easy access to the current version of both the client and server applications.
* **Deployment Verification:** Can be used to quickly verify that a new deployment has been successfully pushed to production.

**Drawbacks:**

* **Information Disclosure:** Reveals internal build details, which *could* potentially be exploited by an attacker. (See Security Considerations below)
* **UI Clutter:**  May not be aesthetically pleasing or relevant to all users.
* **Maintenance:**  Requires updating the timestamp during each build/deployment process.

**Security Considerations:**

* **Don't expose sensitive information:** The timestamp should *not* include any sensitive build parameters or secrets.  It should be purely a version/build identifier.
* **Avoid detailed timestamps:**  A very precise timestamp (e.g., down to the millisecond) isn't necessary and might expose more information than needed.  A date or build number is often sufficient.
* **Consider obfuscation:** While not essential, obfuscating the build ID slightly could add a layer of security.
* **Don't rely on it for security decisions:** Never use this timestamp for any security-critical decisions within the application. It's purely for informational purposes.
* **Evaluate the risk:** Determine if the benefits of displaying the timestamp outweigh the potential risks based on the applicationâ€™s security requirements.
