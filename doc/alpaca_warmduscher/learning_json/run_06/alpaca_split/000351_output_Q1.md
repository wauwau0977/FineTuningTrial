Setting `position: absolute` on `.myLoadingSpinner` removes it from the normal document flow. This means it no longer occupies space in the layout, and surrounding elements will behave as if it doesn't exist. This can lead to elements overlapping or shifting unexpectedly.

To mitigate these issues, you could consider the following:

1. **Relative Positioning on a Parent:**  Position the parent element of `.myLoadingSpinner` with `position: relative`.  This establishes a positioning context for the absolutely positioned spinner, ensuring itâ€™s positioned relative to its parent instead of the viewport.
2. **Padding/Margin on the Parent:** Add appropriate padding or margin to the parent element to create space for the spinner, preventing overlap with other content. The amount of padding/margin should match the size of the spinner.
3. **Using Flexbox or Grid:** If the surrounding layout uses Flexbox or Grid, consider using these techniques to create a designated space for the spinner and ensure it doesn't disrupt the overall flow.
4. **Z-index:** Ensure a suitable `z-index` is applied to both the spinner and surrounding elements to control which elements appear on top.
