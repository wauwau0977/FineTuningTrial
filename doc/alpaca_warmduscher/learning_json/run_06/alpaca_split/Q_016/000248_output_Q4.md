The `req.clone()` method is used to create a copy of the original `HttpRequest` object before modifying its headers. This is crucial because `HttpRequest` objects are immutable. Attempting to directly modify the original `req` object would violate this immutability and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors within the Angular HTTP pipeline.

By cloning the request, we create a new instance (`modifiedReq`) that can be safely modified without affecting the original request. This ensures that other interceptors or Angular's internal mechanisms continue to receive the original, unmodified request as expected, maintaining the integrity of the HTTP request lifecycle.  Angular's HTTP interceptors are designed to work with immutable request objects, making cloning a fundamental step in any modification process.
