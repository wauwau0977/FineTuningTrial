This code snippet defines a CSS rule for elements with the class `myLastSpace`. Specifically, it sets the `height` property of these elements to `100px`. This means that any HTML element assigned the class `myLastSpace` will be rendered with a fixed height of 100 pixels, regardless of its content. This can be used to ensure consistent vertical spacing or to reserve a specific amount of space for a component or section of the UI.
