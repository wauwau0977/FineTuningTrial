The class utilizes `@Lob` and `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` for the `message`, `detail`, and `exception` fields.  Explain the purpose of these annotations and how they impact the persistence of these fields in a database. What potential considerations should be made regarding the size or content of these fields?
