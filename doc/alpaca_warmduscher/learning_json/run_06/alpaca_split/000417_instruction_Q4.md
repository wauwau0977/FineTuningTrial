For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.ts' we have the following question:

Describe the structure and purpose of the `chartOptionsCompressorHours` object. Detail each key-value pair within this object, focusing on how it contributes to the final chart appearance and functionality.  Be specific about the types of chart elements it configures (e.g., line, column, markers) and explain the significance of the `plotOptions` section.
