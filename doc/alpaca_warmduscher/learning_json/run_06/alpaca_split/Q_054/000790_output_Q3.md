The `ORDER BY measurement_date ASC` clause sorts the results of the query in ascending order based on the `measurement_date` column.  This means that the rows will be returned starting with the oldest `measurement_date` and progressing to the most recent.

The impact is that the results are presented in chronological order. This is crucial for time-series data like heat pump measurements, as it allows for easier analysis of trends and patterns over time.  

Ascending order is likely preferred in this scenario because it provides a natural, intuitive way to view the data.  Analyzing heat pump performance typically involves understanding how temperature changes over time, so starting with the earliest measurements and moving forward is the most logical approach.  A descending order (`DESC`) might be useful for viewing the most recent measurements first, but for a general overview and trend analysis, ascending order is usually more helpful. It makes it easier to visualize and interpret the data effectively.
