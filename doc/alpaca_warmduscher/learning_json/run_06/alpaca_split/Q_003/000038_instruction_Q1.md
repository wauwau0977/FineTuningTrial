For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/polyfills.ts' with name 'polyfills.ts'... 
The file mentions disabling patching of specific event names using `(window as any).__zone_symbol__UNPATCHED_EVENTS = ['scroll', 'mousemove'];`.  What potential benefits might there be in excluding certain events from Zone.js patching, and what considerations would a developer need to make before doing so?
