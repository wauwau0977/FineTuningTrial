You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code defines a configuration object for the production environment of the 'Warmduscher' application's client-side component. It contains key settings like the base URL for service communication, a refresh interval for full page updates, and a build timestamp for versioning. This file is specifically for the production deployment of the application.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts
- **Class Name(s):** None. This file contains a JavaScript object literal, not a class definition.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**:  Provides configuration settings for the production environment of the Warmduscher client application.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This file does not directly handle user inputs. It *provides* outputs (configuration values) to the application during runtime.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The file simply defines a constant object `environment` containing pre-defined configuration values.
- **External Interactions**: None directly. The values within this file are used internally by the client application code.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  No explicit error or edge case handling is present in this file. The values are hardcoded; any misconfiguration would require code modification and redeployment.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The file is small and does not significantly impact application performance.
- **Scalability**: The file itself does not affect scalability. Scalability is dependent on the application leveraging the configuration.
- **Security**: The `serviceBaseURL` should be reviewed for potential security implications. Ensure it points to a secure (HTTPS) endpoint. Sensitive information is *not* stored directly in this file.
- **Maintainability**: The file is simple and easy to maintain. Changes to configuration values require code modification and redeployment.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The file is static and reliable as long as the deployment process doesn't corrupt it.
- **Usability**: Easy to understand and modify configuration values (but requires redeployment).
- **Compliance**: None specifically identified.

## 5. Key Components
- **`environment` object**:  This is the primary component. It encapsulates all configuration parameters.
  - `production: true`:  A boolean flag indicating the production environment.
  - `serviceBaseURL: "."`: The base URL for the backend service. "." means the current server.
  - `fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24`:  Defines the interval (in seconds) for a full page refresh (24 hours).
  - `buildTimestampClient: "v01-20220220-093352"`:  A timestamp indicating the build date and time. Useful for versioning and debugging.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **JavaScript Object Literals**: The file uses JavaScript object literal notation to define the configuration.
- **Number Literals:** Used for defining `fullPageRefreshInSeconds`
- **String Literals**: Used for defining URL and timestamp values.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None. This file is plain JavaScript and doesn't rely on external frameworks or libraries.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
-  This file may be used in other parts of the `thserver-client` application, but no specific internal dependencies are explicitly declared within the file itself.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Configuration Management:**  Consider using a more robust configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files loaded at runtime, or a dedicated configuration service) to avoid hardcoding values and enable dynamic configuration changes without redeployment.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration:**  Establish a clear strategy for managing different environments (development, staging, production) and ensure proper configuration segregation.
- **Security Review:** Regularly review the `serviceBaseURL` to ensure it points to a secure and trusted endpoint.
- **Logging:** Add logging to capture configuration values during application startup for debugging and auditing purposes.
