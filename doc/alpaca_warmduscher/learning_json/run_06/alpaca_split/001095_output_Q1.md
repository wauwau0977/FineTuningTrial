`AutowireCapableBeanFactory` is used because it specifically allows autowiring of *existing* bean instances.  A standard `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext` primarily focuses on creating and managing beans through its lifecycle. While these can *locate* beans, they aren't designed for taking a pre-existing object and injecting dependencies into it. 

The implications of this choice are:

1.  **Limited Scope:** This bean factory focuses solely on autowiring, it doesn't provide access to all the features of a full `ApplicationContext` like AOP, internationalization, or event publishing.
2.  **Flexibility:** It provides more flexibility when you need to interact with objects that aren't managed by Spring initially.
3.  **Potential for Issues:**  If the bean has complex dependencies or circular dependencies, autowiring it at runtime might lead to exceptions that wouldn't occur during standard Spring startup. Itâ€™s essential to ensure the target object is compatible with the Spring context and doesn't introduce conflicts.
4. **Performance:** Autowiring at runtime is potentially slower than letting Spring manage the bean's creation from the beginning.
