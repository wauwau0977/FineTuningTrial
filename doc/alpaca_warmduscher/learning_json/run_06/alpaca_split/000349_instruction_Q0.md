You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the styling rules defined in the `boiler-chart.component.sass` file, part of the 'Warmduscher' project. This file defines the visual presentation of the `BoilerChartComponent` within the application, controlling the layout, sizing, colors, and some animations of its elements. It primarily focuses on visual aspects and doesn't contain any functional logic.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.sass`
- **Class Name(s):**  Styling rules for various elements within the `BoilerChartComponent`, no explicit class names in the SASS file beyond CSS selectors.

## 3. Functional Requirements

This file *does not* contain functional requirements as it is a stylesheet. It provides *visual* specifications only.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Maintainability:** The use of SASS allows for modularity and reusability of styles. However, the use of `::ng-deep` can make styling more difficult to manage in the long run.
- **Usability:** The styles aim to provide a clear and informative visual presentation of the boiler chart data.
- **Performance:**  The animations (fadeIn) are relatively simple and shouldn't significantly impact performance. However, complex animations or excessive use of CSS can affect rendering performance.
- **Responsiveness:** The use of percentage-based heights (`40vh`) and flexbox layout implies a degree of responsiveness, though a full assessment requires examining the component's template and overall layout.

## 5. Key Components

- **`.smallFormElement`**: Defines a fixed width for form elements.
- **`.chartItem`**:  Defines a flexbox layout for chart items, centering content and providing margin adjustments.
- **`.chartHint`**: Defines the color of chart hints (semi-transparent white).
- **`.date-selector`**: Styles the date selector container, including spacing for form fields and checkboxes.
- **`.mySlider`**:  Defines a fixed width for a slider component.
- **`.myLoading` & `.myLoadingSpinner`**: Styles the loading indicator (border color and spinner positioning, size, and animation).
- **`.chartStyle`**: Defines the dimensions (width and height) and margin of the chart container.  It also includes a style override using `::ng-deep` for a `.standAlone` parent component.
- **`@keyframes fadeIn`**: Defines an animation to fade in the loading spinner.  The animation is designed to delay the spinner's visibility for a period.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **SASS:** Uses SASS syntax (variables, nesting, mixins, etc.).
- **CSS:**  Fundamental styling language.
- **CSS Animations**: Defines animated styles using keyframes.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular Material:** The presence of `.mat-form-field` and `.mat-checkbox` indicates the use of Angular Material for form elements and checkboxes.
- **Angular:** Angularâ€™s component styling approach is implicitly used.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly stated in the SASS file.  Dependencies would be evident in the component's TypeScript file.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Refactor `::ng-deep` usage:**  `::ng-deep` is discouraged in Angular as it can lead to styling conflicts and makes it difficult to maintain component encapsulation. Consider alternative approaches like using CSS variables or publicizing CSS classes within the component.
- **Improve Responsiveness:** Fully assess and potentially enhance responsiveness by utilizing more flexible units (e.g., `rem`, `em`) and media queries.
- **CSS Variables:** Using CSS variables could improve maintainability and allow for easy theme customization.
- **Code Readability:** While relatively clean, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of more complex styles or overrides.
- **Animation Optimization:** Evaluate the necessity and performance impact of the `fadeIn` animation.  Simpler animations or CSS transitions might be sufficient.
