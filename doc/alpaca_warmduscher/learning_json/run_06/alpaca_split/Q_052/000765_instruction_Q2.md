For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java' with name 'HeatPumpRepository.java'... 
Examine the `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method. The SQL query inside calculates several window functions (e.g., `first_value`, `last_value`, `min`, `max`) over the `measurement_date` column partitioned by `year1`, `doy`, and `hour_of_day`. What is the practical significance of partitioning the data in this way? What does this partitioning achieve in the context of analyzing heat pump data?
