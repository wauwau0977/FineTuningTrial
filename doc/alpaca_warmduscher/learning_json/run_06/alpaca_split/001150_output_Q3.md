The overall design goal of the `ThException` class is to provide a custom, unchecked exception type specific to the 'Warmduscher' project. By extending `RuntimeException`, it offers a flexible way to signal error conditions without forcing calling code to explicitly handle it.  The two constructors provide options to either convey a descriptive message about the error or to wrap another exception to provide more detailed information about the errorâ€™s root cause.

This class would benefit use cases within the 'Warmduscher' project where specific application-level errors need to be signaled. Examples might include invalid sensor readings, communication failures with external devices, or data validation errors.  Using a custom exception provides better clarity and maintainability than throwing generic `RuntimeException` instances.  The `cause` constructor is particularly useful when an underlying library or system component throws an exception, allowing the application to wrap it with a more meaningful context specific to the application's logic. It aids in centralized error handling and improved debugging.
