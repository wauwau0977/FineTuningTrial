The `generateShortTextUUID()` method generates a unique, short textual representation of a UUID, guaranteed to be 22 characters long, using a Base58 encoding similar to Bitcoin. It begins by creating a short text representation of a randomly generated UUID using the `toShortText()` method. 

The method checks if the generated short text's length is less than the expected fixed size of 22. If it's shorter, it generates *another* random UUID, converts it to short text, and then appends enough characters from the second UUID's short text to the first to reach the required 22-character length.  This ensures the final output always has the intended length. 

Importantly, the character set used in the `toShortText()` method (via `Base58BitcoinFlavor`) is carefully selected to include only alphanumeric characters and avoid control characters, special characters, and visually similar characters like 'I' and '1'. This ensures the generated short text is safe for use in various systems and doesn't cause confusion due to character ambiguity. The `Base58BitcoinFlavor` class handles the specific character set.
