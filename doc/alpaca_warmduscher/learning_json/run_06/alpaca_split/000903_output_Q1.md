Using a simple data class like `SessionDevice` – often called an Anemic Domain Model – offers several benefits:

*   **Simplicity and Testability:** The class is easy to understand and test. Because it mainly contains data and getter/setter methods, unit tests are straightforward to write and maintain.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is typically handled in separate service or application layers. This promotes a clear separation of concerns and makes the code more modular.
*   **Flexibility:** The data class can be easily reused in different contexts and adapted to various business requirements.  It's a flexible and adaptable data structure.
*   **ORM Compatibility:**  It works very well with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate or JPA, as the ORM can easily map the fields to database columns.

However, there are also drawbacks:

*   **Lack of Encapsulation:** The data is directly accessible through getter and setter methods, potentially leading to inconsistent data or unintended side effects if not carefully managed in the service layer.
*   **Logic Dispersion:** Business logic is scattered across multiple service classes instead of being encapsulated within the domain object itself. This can make the code harder to maintain and understand over time.
*   **Increased Complexity in Service Layer:** The service layer may become more complex as it handles all the business rules and validations that would otherwise be handled by the domain object.

In contrast, a more complex domain object with embedded business logic offers stronger encapsulation and better organization of business rules. However, it can also lead to tightly coupled code and increased complexity within the domain object itself.

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements of the project. For simple applications or projects where the business logic is relatively straightforward, an anemic domain model can be a good choice. For more complex applications with intricate business rules, a richer domain object might be more appropriate.
