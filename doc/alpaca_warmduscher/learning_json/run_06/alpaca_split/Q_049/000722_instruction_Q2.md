For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataMockImpl.java' with name 'MeteoDataMockImpl.java'... 
The `getData()` method calculates `WindGustSpeed` as `dtS / 30 + 60` and `Temperature` as `dtS / 10 - 10`. Assuming `dtS` represents time elapsed in seconds, what potential issues could arise from these calculations regarding the values returned, and how could you improve these calculations to provide more realistic or stable data? Consider edge cases and potential for unbounded growth or unexpected behavior.
