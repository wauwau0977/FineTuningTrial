The `<noscript>` tag provides a fallback message to users who have JavaScript disabled in their browser. This is crucial because the Warmduscher application is likely a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular, which heavily relies on JavaScript to handle routing, rendering, and data fetching. Without JavaScript, the application would not function correctly.

The `<noscript>` tag serves as a polite notification to these users, explaining that JavaScript is required to use the application.

Regarding accessibility for users who cannot or do not use JavaScript, several considerations should be made:

*   **Graceful Degradation:** While a fully functional experience without JavaScript might not be possible, the application should strive to provide *some* useful content or information, even if it's just a static page explaining the application's purpose.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) can provide a basic, static HTML version of the application that can be accessed by users without JavaScript, improving accessibility and SEO.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Using semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`) can improve the accessibility of the static content for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Building the application with a progressive enhancement approach ensures that core functionality is available even without JavaScript, with enhancements added for users who have JavaScript enabled.
*   **Alternative Contact Method:** Providing a clear and accessible contact method (e.g., email address) allows users with disabilities to request assistance or information.
