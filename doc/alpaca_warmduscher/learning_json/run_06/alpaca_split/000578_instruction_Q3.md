For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass' with name 'overview-current.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```sass
.myHeader ::ng-deep
 .mat-card-header-text
   margin-left: 0
 margin-bottom: 10px
```
