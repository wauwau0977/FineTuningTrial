The primary potential problem with `context.getBean(StartupData.class)` is that a `StartupData` bean might *not* be defined in the application context.  If no bean of type `StartupData` exists, Spring will throw a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` at runtime, causing the application to fail.

Here are a few ways to mitigate this:

1. **Check for Bean Existence Before Retrieval:** Before attempting to retrieve the bean, you can check if it exists using `context.containsBean("startupData")`. This allows you to handle the case where the bean is missing gracefully, perhaps by logging a warning or providing a default value.

   ```java
   if (context.containsBean("startupData")) {
       StartupData startupData = context.getBean(StartupData.class);
       startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(timeTaken.toMillis());
   } else {
       // Log a warning or handle the missing bean appropriately
       System.err.println("StartupData bean not found in context.");
   }
   ```

2. **Use Optional:** Spring provides `@Nullable` annotations. If the `StartupData` bean is potentially not defined, the application can use `@Nullable` on the getter method to ensure proper handling.

3. **Ensure Bean Definition:** The most robust solution is to guarantee that a `StartupData` bean is always defined in the application context.  This can be achieved by:
   *   Adding a `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Configuration` annotation to a class that implements `StartupData`.
   *   Defining a bean definition in a Spring configuration file (e.g., XML or Java Config).
   *   Ensuring that any component that creates the `StartupData` bean is properly initialized and functioning.

The best approach depends on the application's requirements and the level of control you have over the bean definitions.  Checking for bean existence is a good defensive programming practice, but ensuring that the bean is always defined is generally the preferred solution if possible.
