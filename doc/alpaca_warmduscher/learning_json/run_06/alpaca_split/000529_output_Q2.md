In the context of a gauge chart displaying critical system data, the `<mat-card-footer>` could house several helpful UI/UX elements. Here are two examples:

1.  **Last Updated Timestamp:** Displaying a "Last Updated: [timestamp]" message in the footer is crucial for indicating the freshness of the data. Critical system data changes frequently, and users need to know if the displayed value is current.  This builds trust and prevents misinterpretation.

2.  **Data Source/Units:** Including a small label indicating the source of the data (e.g., "Sensor XYZ", "Database Server") and the units of measurement (e.g., "PSI", "%", "kW") provides important context.  Users donâ€™t have to guess where the value comes from or what it represents.  It can also include a tooltip on hover with more detailed information about the data source.

Other potential additions could include a refresh button (if the data isn't auto-updating), or a link to more detailed data/logs related to the gauge.
