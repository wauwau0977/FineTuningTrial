Representing compressor state with a simple `Boolean` is limiting and introduces potential ambiguity. A `true` value might represent "running", but it doesn't convey information about potential fault conditions or idle states. This limits the analytical insights we can derive from the data and could lead to incorrect interpretations.

To improve this while maintaining backward compatibility, I would introduce an `enum` to represent the compressor state.  This provides a clear, self-documenting way to represent all possible states.

```java
public enum CompressorState {
    RUNNING,
    IDLE,
    FAULTED,
    STARTING,
    STOPPING
}
```

Then, the interface would be updated to use this enum:

```java
Boolean getCompressorState(); //Existing method - keep for backward compatibility

CompressorState getCompressorStateEnum(); //New method
```

The existing `getCompressorState()` method could be updated to map the enum values to a boolean representation (e.g. `RUNNING` and `STARTING` map to true, everything else false) to maintain compatibility with existing consumers. New code should preferably use the enum-based method. This approach allows new features to be added without breaking existing code.
