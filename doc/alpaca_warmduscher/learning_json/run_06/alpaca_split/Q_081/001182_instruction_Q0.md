You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface, `UnsafeRunnable`, defines a functional interface with a single abstract method `run()`. This method is designed to encapsulate a potentially exception-throwing operation.  The intention is to allow a caller to handle exceptions that might arise during the execution of the run method in a controlled manner. Itâ€™s a utility for situations where exception handling within a lambda or method reference is necessary but cumbersome.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java
- **Class Name(s):** `UnsafeRunnable`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:  Defines a functional interface for a Runnable that explicitly declares that its `run()` method can throw an `Exception`.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  No direct user input or output. This interface is a contract for code that *implements* it.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The interface itself does not contain any workflow or logic.  Implementations will define the process within the `run()` method.
- **External Interactions**:  None. The interface itself has no external interactions. Implementations may have external interactions.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The interface itself doesn't handle edge cases. The *implementation* of the `run()` method is responsible for handling any exceptions and edge cases related to the operation it performs.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal overhead as it is a simple interface.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable; interface does not directly affect scalability.
- **Security**: Not directly applicable; security depends on the implementation of the `run()` method.
- **Maintainability**:  Simple and clear interface, easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Not directly applicable; relies on the implementation.
- **Usability**: Easy to use; provides a standard way to handle potentially exception-throwing operations.
- **Compliance**: Not applicable.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:  The interface defines a single abstract method `run()`.
- **Important logic flows**: No inherent logic flows within the interface itself.
- **Error handling**: The interface *requires* the implementation to handle exceptions within the `run()` method, but doesn't provide any specific error handling mechanism itself.
- **Classes**: There are no subclasses defined for this interface.
- **Modules**:  This is a self-contained interface with no specific module dependencies.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Functional Interfaces
- Exception Handling

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Documentation**: Add Javadoc comments to clearly explain the purpose and usage of the interface.
- **Consider a more specific Exception type:** While `Exception` is broad, consider if a more specific exception type could be used to limit the potential errors that need to be handled. However, the current design is flexible for handling any type of exception.
- **Optional Error Handling Callback**:  Consider adding an optional callback function to the interface for handling exceptions without requiring the calling code to use a try-catch block.  This would make usage even simpler.
