Directly concatenating strings to form file paths can lead to several issues:

*   **Platform Dependency:** File path separators vary between operating systems (e.g., `/` on Unix-like systems, `\` on Windows). Hardcoding separators makes the code less portable.
*   **Incorrect Path Handling:**  If `baseDirectory` already contains a trailing separator, the resulting path might have redundant separators, or might not be interpreted correctly by the operating system.
*   **Security Concerns:** If `baseDirectory` is derived from user input (which isn't the case here, but it’s a good practice to be aware of), constructing file paths through string concatenation could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

The code could be improved by using the `Path` API introduced in Java 7, which provides a more robust and platform-independent way to manipulate file paths. Specifically, the `resolve()` method should be used to combine the base directory and the relative path.

Here’s how the code could be improved:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ... inside the main method ...

Path baseDirectoryPath = Paths.get(args[0]);
Path mavenWrapperPropertyFilePath = baseDirectoryPath.resolve(MAVEN_WRAPPER_PROPERTIES_PATH);
File mavenWrapperPropertyFile = mavenWrapperPropertyFilePath.toFile();
```

This approach has several advantages:

*   **Platform Independence:**  The `Path` API automatically handles the correct file path separators for the current operating system.
*   **Robustness:** It handles redundant separators and ensures that the resulting path is valid.
*   **Readability:**  It makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
*   **More Powerful Path Manipulation:** The `Path` API provides a wide range of methods for manipulating file paths, such as resolving relative paths, extracting file names, and checking file existence.
