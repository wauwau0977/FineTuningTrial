Throwing `Throwable` is a very broad practice. The design likely aimed for maximum flexibility and to catch *any* potential issue during data retrieval. Perhaps the developers anticipated a wide range of failure scenarios – network issues, device errors, data corruption, or even unexpected runtime exceptions – and wanted a single catch-all for handling them. However, this approach has several drawbacks. It obscures the specific cause of the failure, making debugging and error handling more difficult for calling code.  The calling code must catch `Throwable`, which is extremely broad and might hide legitimate exceptions unrelated to heating data retrieval.  It also hinders the ability to provide targeted error handling; for example, retrying a failed read due to a temporary network issue isn't possible without inspecting the underlying exception.  A better practice would be to define custom exception types specific to the `HeatingDataReadService`, or throw more specific, checked exceptions, allowing callers to handle known failure scenarios gracefully.
