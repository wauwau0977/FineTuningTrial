These annotations are used to handle potentially large text data within the database. `@Lob` signifies that the field is a Large Object, meaning it can store a significant amount of data (beyond the typical size limits of VARCHAR fields).  However, `@Lob` alone isn't enough.  It only indicates the *type* of data.  

The `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` annotation explicitly tells Hibernate how to map that large object to a database column.  Different database systems handle large text differently. `TextType` specifically maps to database types like `TEXT` or `CLOB`, which are designed for large text storage. Without specifying the type, Hibernate might default to a less appropriate mapping, potentially leading to truncation or errors when storing or retrieving large strings.  Essentially, `@Lob` declares the potential size, and `@Type` specifies *how* to store it.
