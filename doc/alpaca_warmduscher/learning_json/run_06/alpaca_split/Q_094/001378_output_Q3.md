The `@Bean` annotation signifies that the `jacksonFactory()` method is a factory method responsible for creating and returning a Spring bean.  It tells Spring to treat the object returned by this method as a bean that should be managed by the Spring application context.  

The return value, `JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance()`, is an instance of the `JacksonFactory` class.  This `JacksonFactory` is used by Google's API client library for handling JSON serialization and deserialization.  Within the Spring context, this bean will be available for dependency injection into other components that require JSON processing capabilities. Essentially, it's providing a ready-to-use instance of a JSON factory for other parts of the application.  The `getDefaultInstance()` method ensures a shared, singleton instance of the factory is used.
