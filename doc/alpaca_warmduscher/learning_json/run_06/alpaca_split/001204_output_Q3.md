The `getRequestIP` method aims to determine the client's IP address from an `HttpServletRequest` object. It does so by checking a series of HTTP headers commonly used by proxies and load balancers to forward the original client's IP address.

The logic behind iterating through the `IP_HEADERS` array is to check each header in order. Many proxies and load balancers will add or modify headers like "X-Forwarded-For", "Proxy-Client-IP", etc., to indicate the original client's IP address. The method checks each header to see if it exists and is not empty. If a non-empty header is found, the method splits the header's value by commas (and any surrounding whitespace) and returns the result as a string array.  This handles cases where multiple IP addresses might be listed in a header (e.g., a chain of proxies). If none of the headers contain a valid IP address, the method falls back to using `request.getRemoteAddr()`, which provides the IP address of the immediate client connected to the web server.
