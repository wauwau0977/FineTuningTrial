For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.html' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.html' we have the following question: 
Describe how the component’s responsiveness is handled, or rather, how it *isn’t* handled, and suggest a solution to make the gauge chart responsive within the `mat-card`. Assume the container (`mat-card`) may resize based on screen size or browser window changes. Explain the suggested changes needed in the HTML and, if necessary, briefly mention TypeScript side considerations.
