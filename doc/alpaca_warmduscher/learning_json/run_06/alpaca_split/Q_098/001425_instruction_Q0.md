You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code defines a bean class `InfoBean` used to encapsulate and provide access to server information such as device name, build timestamp, and build version. The values for build timestamp and build version are injected via Spring's `@Value` annotation, reading them from application configuration properties. This bean is primarily designed for providing server metadata to external consumers, likely through a web service endpoint.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java
- **Class Name(s):** `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.InfoBean`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Provides access to server information (device name, build timestamp, build version).
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Inputs**: Device name (can be set via setter). Build timestamp and build version are configured via external properties files.
    - **Outputs**:  `String` values for device name, build timestamp, and build version, accessed via getter methods.  A `String` representation of the bean via the `toString()` method.
- **Workflow/Logic**:  The class primarily functions as a data holder.  Values are set either via setter methods (for device name) or injected via Spring during bean creation (for build timestamp and version). Getter methods provide access to these values.
- **External Interactions**: Reads configuration properties from the Spring application context (via `@Value`).
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Device name can be an empty string if not explicitly set.
    - Build timestamp and build version will be empty if corresponding properties are not defined in the configuration files.  The application should handle this gracefully, potentially providing default values or logging a warning.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The class has minimal computational complexity. Accessing values via getter methods is expected to be very fast.
- **Scalability**: The class itself doesn't introduce any scalability concerns.
- **Security**: No direct security implications, as it's simply a data holder.  However, the information it provides could be part of a larger system where security is important.
- **Maintainability**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand, promoting maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: High reliability is expected, as it is a simple bean with minimal logic.
- **Usability**: The class is designed for easy integration with other components through its getter methods.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `getDeviceName()`: Returns the device name.
    - `setDeviceName(String deviceName)`: Sets the device name.
    - `getBuildTimestampServer()`: Returns the build timestamp.
    - `setBuildTimestampServer(String buildTimestampServer)`: Sets the build timestamp.
    - `getBuildVersionServer()`: Returns the build version.
    - `setBuildVersionServer(String buildVersionServer)`: Sets the build version.
    - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the bean’s fields.
- **Important logic flows**:  Simple getter and setter operations.
- **Error handling**:  No explicit error handling within the class itself.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is a self-contained module with minimal dependencies.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- String manipulation.
- Basic Java data types.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection (`@Component`, `@Value`).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements:** No significant performance bottlenecks are anticipated.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements**: No direct security risks, but consider the sensitivity of the information it provides within the larger application context.
- **Scalability Considerations**: No specific scalability considerations for this class itself.
- **Configuration Validation**: Add validation to ensure that the build timestamp and version properties are properly configured in the application. This could be done during application startup.
- **Immutability**: Consider making the bean immutable by removing the setters and providing the values through the constructor. This would improve thread safety and prevent accidental modification of the bean’s state.
