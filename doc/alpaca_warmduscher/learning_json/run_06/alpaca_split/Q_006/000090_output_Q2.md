To add a wildcard route, you place a route with an empty path (`''`) or a `**` path as the last route in the `routes` array. The `redirectTo` property directs unmatched paths to the desired component. The import for `NotFoundComponent` must also be added.

First, add the import:

```typescript
import { NotFoundComponent } from './not-found/not-found.component';
```

Then, modify the `routes` array:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'}, //optional home route as default
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }
];
```

Explanation:

*   `path: '**'` matches any path that hasn't been matched by a previous route.
*   `component: NotFoundComponent` specifies the component to display when an unmatched route is encountered. The `pathMatch` is not necessary for wildcard routes.
* I added an optional default route to redirect to home, but this is optional.
