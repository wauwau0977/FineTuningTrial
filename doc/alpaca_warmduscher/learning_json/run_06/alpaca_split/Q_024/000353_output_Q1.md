The negative margins on `.chartItem` (`margin-right: -15px` and `margin-left: -15px`) are designed to create a slight overlap between adjacent chart items. By pushing the items slightly past their natural boundaries, it can create a more visually dense or connected appearance.

A potential scenario where this technique would be useful within the context of a chart or list layout is to create a continuous visual flow, especially when the chart items are relatively narrow. This is often used to give the impression of a single, unbroken line or a ribbon of data. For example, a timeline chart could use this technique to connect different data points visually. It can also be used to make the chart appear more compact and reduce the overall whitespace. The effect is subtle, but can enhance the overall aesthetic and improve the visual impact of the chart.
