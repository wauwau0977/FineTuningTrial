For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts' with name 'meteoSwissEntity.ts'... 
The `ofWebService` method is responsible for creating a `MeteoSwissEntity` instance from web service data. Considering the input `data` could potentially contain values with incorrect types, what potential issues might arise during the instantiation process and how could you improve the robustness of this method to handle such scenarios? Focus specifically on type safety and preventing runtime errors.
