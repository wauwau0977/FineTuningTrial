The `isSessionRelevantRequest` method determines whether a given request should trigger the creation or update of a `SessionDevice` record. It filters out requests for static assets (html, css, images, js, fonts) and also excludes requests to root paths ("/"), "/pi11", and "/pi11/".  It also ignores OPTIONS requests which are typically preflight requests. The purpose is to avoid unnecessary database writes for requests that don't represent meaningful user interactions or data submissions.

A potential improvement would be to move the list of excluded extensions and paths into a configuration file (e.g., application.properties or YAML). This would allow for easier modification and extension without requiring code changes and recompilation.  Instead of hardcoding the extensions and paths, the method could read them from the configuration.  

For example, the configuration might look like:

```
warmduscher.session.excluded-extensions=html,htm,css,png,svg,woff,woff2,json,js
warmduscher.session.excluded-paths=/,/pi11,/pi11/
```

And the method would be updated to read these values, making it more maintainable and scalable.  This approach decouples the filter's behavior from the code itself, allowing for dynamic configuration adjustments.
