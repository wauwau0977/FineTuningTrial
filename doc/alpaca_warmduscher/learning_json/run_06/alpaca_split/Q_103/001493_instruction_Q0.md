You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code provides a unit test for a static method `getSignedNumber` within the `HeatingModbusReadService` class. The method converts an unsigned 16-bit integer to a signed 16-bit integer, handling values that represent negative numbers when interpreted as signed integers. The test suite verifies the correctness of this conversion for both positive and negative values.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingModbusReadServiceTest`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: The primary operation is to test the `getSignedNumber` method within the `HeatingModbusReadService` class.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** Unsigned 16-bit integers (0-65535) passed to the `HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber()` method.
    - **Output:** Assertions (pass/fail) indicating whether the returned signed integer is correct.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The test suite executes a series of `assertEquals` calls, providing an unsigned integer as input to the `getSignedNumber` method and comparing the returned signed integer with the expected value.
- **External Interactions**: None. The test is self-contained and does not interact with external systems (databases, APIs, files, or UI).
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The test suite explicitly includes tests for:
    - Zero
    - Positive numbers
    - Numbers near the maximum positive value (32767)
    - Numbers representing negative values when interpreted as signed integers (e.g., 65535 representing -1).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: N/A - This is a unit test, so performance is not a critical concern.
- **Scalability**: N/A - This is a unit test and doesn’t require scalability.
- **Security**: N/A - This is a unit test and doesn’t require security measures.
- **Maintainability**: The test suite is relatively simple and easy to understand, making it maintainable.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The test suite should consistently pass given a correct implementation of `getSignedNumber`.
- **Usability**: The test suite is readily usable by developers to verify the functionality of `getSignedNumber`.
- **Compliance**: N/A

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `void getSignedNumber()`: The test method that calls `HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber()` with various inputs and verifies the outputs using `assertEquals`.
- **Important Logic Flows**: The test suite executes a straightforward series of assertions based on the expected behavior of the `getSignedNumber` method.
- **Error Handling**: The test suite relies on JUnit assertions to detect errors. Failed assertions will indicate an incorrect implementation of the `getSignedNumber` method.
- **Classes**: There are no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: No module definition

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures (primitive integers)
- Control flow statements (e.g., `assertEquals`)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **JUnit Jupiter API**: Used for defining and executing the unit tests.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.device.service.impl.HeatingModbusReadService`: The class containing the `getSignedNumber` method being tested.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhanecments**: Not applicable for this unit test.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable and concise.
- **Security Improvements**: Not applicable for this unit test.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable for this unit test.
- **More Comprehensive Testing:** Consider adding more edge case tests, such as testing the boundary values (0, 65535) and potentially using parameterised tests to reduce code duplication.
