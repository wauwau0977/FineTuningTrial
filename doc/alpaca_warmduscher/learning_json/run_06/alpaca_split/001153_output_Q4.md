The `ThException` class would be modified to include logging in both constructors. The logging implementation will use a standard Java logging framework (e.g., `java.util.logging` or Log4j2), but for clarity, I'll describe the logging details as if it's a custom logging system. We'll log to a file named "thserver.log" in the project's root directory, appending to the existing content.

**In both constructors:**

1.  **Log Level:** We'll use the `ERROR` log level to signify that an exception has occurred.
2.  **Log Message:** The log message will be structured as follows:  `"Timestamp - ERROR - [ClassName] - Message"`.
    *   **Timestamp:** The current date and time in a standard format (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`).
    *   **ERROR:** The log level, "ERROR".
    *   **[ClassName]:** The fully qualified name of the class where the exception originated (e.g., `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.ThException`).
    *   **Message:** The exception message passed to the constructor.

3.  **Stack Trace (if cause is present):** If the constructor receives a `Throwable cause`, we will *also* log the stack trace of the original cause. The stack trace will be logged *after* the main log message, indented by a few spaces for readability.  Each line of the stack trace will be prefixed with a tab character.  If no cause is present, this step is skipped.

**Example Log Output (assuming a `ThException` is thrown with the message "Invalid sensor data" and a `NullPointerException` is the cause):**

```
2024-10-27 10:30:00 - ERROR - [com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.ThException] - Invalid sensor data
	at com.example.SomeClass.processData(SomeClass.java:25)
	at com.example.AnotherClass.handleRequest(AnotherClass.java:10)
	...
```

This logging approach ensures that all exceptions are logged with sufficient information for debugging, including the timestamp, error level, originating class, exception message, and the complete stack trace of the root cause if available.  The consistent logging format makes it easier to analyze logs and identify patterns.  The file-based logging allows for persistent storage of error information.
