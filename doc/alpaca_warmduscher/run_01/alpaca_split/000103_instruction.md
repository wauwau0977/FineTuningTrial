You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component displays "About" information for the Warmduscher application, including client and server build timestamps. It retrieves the server build timestamp from a heating data service and displays it alongside the client build timestamp (which is pulled from the environment configuration).

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `AboutComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Display client and server build timestamps. Retrieve the server build timestamp from a service.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  No direct user input. Outputs displayed on the UI via the component's template (`about.component.html`).
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  Component initializes.
    2.  Client build timestamp is loaded from `environment.buildTimestampClient`.
    3.  `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook calls `getBuildTimestampServer`.
    4.  `getBuildTimestampServer` calls `HeatingDataService.getServerInfo()` to fetch server info.
    5.  Upon successful retrieval, the `buildTimestampServer` property is updated.
    6.  The template displays both timestamps.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Calls `HeatingDataService.getServerInfo()` to retrieve server information. This likely involves an HTTP request to a backend API.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    -  If `HeatingDataService.getServerInfo()` fails or returns no data, the `buildTimestampServer` property will remain empty, and the UI will display an empty value.  No explicit error handling is present in the code snippet. The `@ts-ignore` comment suggests potential type issues that are being bypassed without handling.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The component should load and display data quickly. The performance bottleneck is likely the `HeatingDataService` call.
- **Scalability**: The component itself is not a scalability concern. Scalability relies on the `HeatingDataService` and the backend API it connects to.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within this component. Security depends on the `HeatingDataService` and backend API.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and should be easy to maintain.  The `@ts-ignore` comment should be addressed with proper type definitions.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The component’s reliability depends on the `HeatingDataService`.
- **Usability**: The component provides informational data, making it directly usable for debugging or versioning information.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are identified within the provided code.

## 5. Key Components

- **`AboutComponent` Class:**  The main component that manages and displays the "About" information.
- **`ngOnInit()`**: Lifecycle hook that calls `getBuildTimestampServer()` when the component initializes.
- **`getBuildTimestampServer()`**:  Fetches the server build timestamp from the `HeatingDataService`.
- **`buildTimestampClient`**: Public property that stores the client build timestamp.
- **`buildTimestampServer`**: Public property that stores the server build timestamp.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal. Relies on the `HeatingDataService` to handle errors.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- TypeScript classes and interfaces.
- Observables (from RxJS) for asynchronous data handling.
- Decorators (`@Component`) for Angular metadata.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular**:  Used for component creation, data binding, and overall application structure.
- **RxJS**: Used for handling asynchronous operations via Observables and Subscriptions.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`HeatingDataService`**: A service responsible for retrieving server information, potentially from a backend API.
- **`environment`**: An environment configuration file that holds application settings like `buildTimestampClient`.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**:  Cache the server build timestamp if it doesn’t change frequently to avoid redundant API calls.
- **Code Readability**:  Address the `@ts-ignore` comment.  Define proper types for the response from `HeatingDataService.getServerInfo()` to remove the need for the ignore.
- **Error Handling**:  Add error handling within `getBuildTimestampServer()` to gracefully handle API errors (e.g., display an error message to the user or log the error).
- **Scalability Considerations**:  The scalability primarily depends on the backend API and `HeatingDataService`. Ensure the API is designed for high load.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests to verify the component displays the correct information, handles API errors, and loads the client timestamp correctly.
