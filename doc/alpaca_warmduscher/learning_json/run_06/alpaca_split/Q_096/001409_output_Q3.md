The conditional statement `if (groupEveryNthSecond > 0 && maxRows > 0)` is designed to enforce a mutual exclusivity rule for the input parameters `groupEveryNthSecond` and `maxRows`. It checks if both parameters are provided with values greater than 0.

The issue it addresses is that the method has two mutually exclusive ways to limit the data returned: either by grouping data into intervals of a specified number of seconds (`groupEveryNthSecond`) or by limiting the number of rows returned (`maxRows`). Allowing both parameters to be specified simultaneously would lead to ambiguous behavior and potentially incorrect results.

If the condition `groupEveryNthSecond > 0 && maxRows > 0` is met, the method throws a `ThException` with the message "Either supply 'groupEveryNthSecond' or 'maxRows' as a param. Both is not possible". This prevents the method from processing the request with conflicting parameters and signals to the caller that an invalid request was made.
