If multiple instances of the downloader are run concurrently, there’s a potential race condition when creating the output directory. Both instances might simultaneously check if the directory exists, find that it doesn't, and then attempt to create it. This can lead to an `IOException` being thrown by one of the instances, as the directory is already being created (or has been created) by another instance.

To prevent this, the code should use a synchronized block or a more sophisticated mechanism to ensure that only one instance can create the directory at a time.

Here’s how the code could be modified using a synchronized block:

```java
// ... inside the main method ...

File outputFile = new File(baseDirectory.getAbsolutePath(), MAVEN_WRAPPER_JAR_PATH);
File parentDir = outputFile.getParentFile();

synchronized (MavenWrapperDownloader.class) { // Use class object as lock
    if (!parentDir.exists()) {
        if (!parentDir.mkdirs()) {
            System.out.println(
                    "- ERROR creating output directory '" + parentDir.getAbsolutePath() + "'");
        }
    }
}
```

By using a synchronized block, only one thread can execute the code within the block at a time. This ensures that only one instance creates the directory, preventing the race condition.  Using `MavenWrapperDownloader.class` as the lock ensures that all instances of the class synchronize on the same lock.

Alternative solutions:

*   **`mkdirs()` is atomic:** While not guaranteed across all operating systems and file systems, in many cases, `mkdirs()` is atomic enough to prevent race conditions, but using synchronization provides a stronger guarantee.
*   **Atomic Boolean Flag:**  A more complex solution would involve using an atomic boolean flag to indicate whether the directory has been created. Each instance would check the flag, and only create the directory if the flag is false. This is more efficient than synchronization but requires more code.
