A scenario where a class implementing `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` might return `null` for `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()` despite valid data for other fields could occur when data is ingested from an external source with inconsistent or missing timestamps.

**Scenario:** Imagine a data pipeline that processes sensor readings.  The readings are initially stored with timestamps that are only accurate to the *date* level, not the time. A batch job attempts to aggregate the data into daily summaries. During a deployment window, there is a data quality issue where the date part of some incoming sensor readings is briefly invalid or corrupted.  This causes the system to be unable to reliably determine the correct day of the week for those readings.  The other metrics (decreases, increases, record count) *can* still be calculated based on the readings themselves, but the day of the week assignment fails.

**Implementation Handling:**

Within the implementing class, I would:

1.  **Log an Error:** Immediately log a detailed error message including the raw sensor data that caused the issue. This is critical for debugging and data quality monitoring.

2.  **Default Day Assignment:** Instead of propagating `null`, I would assign a default day of the week (e.g., `1` for Monday). This prevents errors downstream.  However, it's *crucial* to also include a flag in the implementing class indicating that the day of the week is invalid (e.g., `private boolean dayOfWeekValid = false;` and a getter `isDayOfWeekValid()`).

3.  **Getter Handling:** The `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()` getter would return the assigned default value *and* the `isDayOfWeekValid()` getter would return `false`.

4.  **Downstream Handling:** Any code that consumes the `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` object *must* check the `isDayOfWeekValid()` flag before using the `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()` value. If the flag is `false`, the consuming code should either:

    *   Exclude the data point from reports/calculations.
    *   Use a special handling mechanism (e.g., grouping all invalid days into a single "Unknown Day" category).
    *   Alert an operator to investigate the data quality issue.

This approach ensures that the system doesn't crash due to a `NullPointerException` but also provides a clear signal that the data is potentially inaccurate, enabling appropriate handling and alerting. This is a robust and reliable strategy for dealing with imperfect data in a production environment.
