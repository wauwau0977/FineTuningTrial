```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.mutex;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class LoggingHooks<T> implements Hooks<T> {

    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(LoggingHooks.class.getName());
    private final String resourceIdentifier;

    public LoggingHooks(String resourceIdentifier) {
        this.resourceIdentifier = resourceIdentifier;
    }

    @Override
    public void before(T t) throws Throwable {
        LocalDateTime timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
        logger.info("Entering protected section for resource: " + resourceIdentifier + " at " + timestamp);
    }

    @Override
    public void after(T t) throws Throwable {
        LocalDateTime timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
        logger.info("Exiting protected section for resource: " + resourceIdentifier + " at " + timestamp);
    }
}
```

This `LoggingHooks` class implements the `Hooks<T>` interface. It is parameterized by the type `T` of the protected resource, although in this logging example, the resource itself isn’t directly used in the logging process – it's present to fulfill the interface contract.

The constructor takes a `resourceIdentifier` string, which is used to distinguish between different protected resources in the logs.

The `before(T t)` method logs an informative message to the logger indicating entry into the protected section, including the resource identifier and a timestamp.  It declares `throws Throwable` as required by the interface.  In a real implementation, error handling within `before` is crucial. If an exception *does* occur within this hook, it's important to log it *before* re-throwing it, to provide diagnostic information.

The `after(T t)` method logs a message indicating exit from the protected section, again including the resource identifier and timestamp. Similar to `before`, it declares `throws Throwable` and would ideally include error logging before re-throwing any exceptions.

This approach keeps the logging logic separate from the core mutex implementation, making the system more modular and easier to maintain. The exception handling ensures that the logging process doesn't mask or swallow errors that occur within the hooks themselves.
