The `seq_id` column is a crucial component in identifying periods when the compressor is running. Itâ€™s calculated using the `row_number() over (order by measurement_date)` and `row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date)` functions. The difference between these two row numbers effectively creates a sequence ID that increments only when the `di10compressor1` state changes (from true to false or vice versa). In simpler terms, `seq_id` represents a distinct 'run' or 'off' period of the compressor.

Here's how it's used to identify compressor runtime:

1.  **Gap Detection:** The `row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date)` calculates a sequence within each compressor state.
2.  **State Changes:** By subtracting this from the overall row number, you get a `seq_id` that *only* increases when the compressor state changes.
3.  **Identifying Runs:**  Each distinct `seq_id` represents a continuous period where the compressor is either running (di10compressor1 = true) or off.

However, relying on this approach for detecting compressor state could have several potential issues:

*   **Data Gaps:** If there are gaps in the data (e.g., missing measurements), the `seq_id` might incorrectly increment, leading to misidentification of compressor runs. A missing measurement could be interpreted as a state change.
*   **Short-lived State Changes:**  Brief, spurious state changes (due to sensor noise or communication errors) could also lead to incorrect `seq_id` increments and inaccurate runtime calculations.
*   **Edge Cases:** If the first or last data point is incomplete or inaccurate, it could affect the accuracy of the `seq_id` calculation.
*    **Database Ordering**: The query relies on the ordering of `measurement_date`. If the data isn't properly ordered in the database, the `seq_id` calculation will be incorrect.

To mitigate these issues, the query includes further filtering to exclude startup and shutdown phases based on `seconds_since_toggle_on` and `seconds_before_toggle_off`. However, these thresholds are based on assumptions about typical compressor behavior and might not be universally accurate. A more robust approach would involve using a more reliable data source for compressor state or implementing more sophisticated anomaly detection techniques to identify and correct data errors.
