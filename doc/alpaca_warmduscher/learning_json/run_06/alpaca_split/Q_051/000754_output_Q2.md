Spring provides mechanisms to track cache statistics, including hit and miss ratios. I would leverage the `CacheStatistics` object available through the `Cache` interface. Here's how I'd integrate monitoring:

1. **Access the Cache:** In the service or data access layer where caching is being used, I need access to the `Cache` object. This is typically done via a `@Cacheable` annotation and then retrieving the cache from the `CacheManager`.

2. **Track Statistics:** After each cache operation (get, put, evict), I'd access the `CacheStatistics` object to update the metrics.

```java
import org.springframework.cache.Cache;
import org.springframework.cache.CacheManager;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

// ...inside your service or data access layer...

@Autowired
private CacheManager cacheManager;

public Object getData(String key) {
    Cache cache = cacheManager.getCache("sessionDeviceCache");
    if (cache != null) {
        Object value = cache.get(key);
        if (value != null) {
            cache.getCacheStatistics().hit(); // Increment hit counter
            return value;
        } else {
            cache.getCacheStatistics().miss(); // Increment miss counter
        }
    }
    // Retrieve data from the underlying source if not in cache...
}
```

3. **Collect Metrics:** The `CacheStatistics` object provides the following methods:

*   `hit()`: Increments the hit counter.
*   `miss()`: Increments the miss counter.
*   `getHits()`: Returns the number of hits.
*   `getMisses()`: Returns the number of misses.

I would collect these values periodically (e.g., every minute) and calculate the following metrics:

*   **Hit Ratio:** `Hits / (Hits + Misses)` - Indicates the percentage of requests served from the cache. A higher hit ratio is desirable.
*   **Miss Ratio:** `Misses / (Hits + Misses)` - The percentage of requests that required fetching data from the underlying source.
*   **Total Requests:** `Hits + Misses` - Overall number of cache requests.

These metrics can then be exported to a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) for visualization and alerting. I would set up alerts to notify me if the hit ratio drops below a certain threshold, indicating a potential caching issue. This monitoring provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the cache and helps optimize caching configurations.
