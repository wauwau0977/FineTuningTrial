These `<link rel="apple-touch-icon"...>` tags are used to specify the icon that will be displayed when a user adds the web application to their home screen on iOS devices (iPhones and iPads).

The reason for multiple tags is to provide different icon sizes and resolutions to suit various screen densities and device capabilities. Apple recommends providing icons in several sizes to ensure the best visual quality on different devices.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **`rel="apple-touch-icon"`:**  This attribute tells the browser that this link specifies the icon to use for the home screen.

*   **`href="assets/icons/icon-192x192_non_transparent_dark.png"`:** This specifies the URL of the icon file. In this case, it's a 192x192 pixel image.

*   **Non-transparent:**  Apple specifically requires that icons for iOS be non-transparent. This is indicated by the `_non_transparent` in the filename.  Transparent icons may not display correctly.

By providing multiple icons with different resolutions (e.g., 167x167, 180x180, 192x192), the operating system can choose the most appropriate icon for the device's screen density, resulting in a sharper and more visually appealing icon on the home screen.  It is a best practice to include a range of sizes to ensure compatibility with all iOS devices.
