I would implement the method as a class method, likely named `getTotalDifference()`. Here's the implementation:

```typescript
export class BoilerStatsByHourEntity {
  // ... (constructor)

  getTotalDifference(): number {
    return this.sumBoilerDiffIncrease + this.sumBoilerDiffDecrease;
  }
}
```

**Considerations and Design Choices:**

1.  **Class Method vs. Static Method:** I chose a class method (instance method) because the calculation is specific to a particular `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` instance.  A static method wouldn't make sense since it wouldn’t operate on an instance's properties.

2.  **Return Type:** The return type is `number`, as the sum of two numbers will be a number.

3.  **Immutability:** This method is *non-mutating*; it doesn't modify the state of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` instance. This is generally good practice, as it makes the code more predictable and easier to reason about.

4.  **Potential Use Cases:**

    *   **Reporting/Display:** The calculated value could be used to display a combined statistic in a user interface or report.
    *   **Aggregations:** The combined statistic could be used as part of a larger aggregation or calculation.
    *   **Comparison:** The value could be compared with other instances or historical data.

5.  **Error Handling:** In this specific case, error handling isn’t strictly necessary because the properties are numbers.  There's no risk of a type error. However, if the properties were potentially nullable or of different types, I would add checks to handle those cases gracefully.

6.  **Readability:** The method name `getTotalDifference()` is clear and concise, making it easy to understand its purpose.

7.  **Testability:** The method is simple and can be easily tested with a few unit tests to ensure it returns the correct value for different input values.

8. **Alternative:**  If the calculation were significantly more complex and involved multiple properties, I might consider extracting the logic into a separate, reusable function to improve code organization and maintainability. However, for a simple calculation like this, keeping it within the class method is perfectly acceptable.
