```java
@Component
public class HeatingDataPoller {
    // ... (other fields and constructor) ...

    @Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}", initialDelay = 0)
    public void pollData() {
        long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
        HeatPumpEntity heatPumpEntity;

        try {
            heatPumpEntity = heatingDataReadService.getData();
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            String msg = "Exception while reading data from ModBus or MockService.";
            log.error(msg, e);
            throw new RuntimeException(msg, e);
        }

        heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity);
        log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0));
    }
}
```

The `pollData` method orchestrates the periodic retrieval and persistence of heating data. Here's a detailed breakdown of its operational flow:

1. **Timing & Start:** The method is triggered by the `@Scheduled` annotation, executing at intervals defined by the `thserver.pollingInterval` property (defaulting to 60 seconds). The execution time is measured using `long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis()`, capturing the start time for performance monitoring.

2. **Data Retrieval:** The core logic begins with attempting to retrieve data via `heatPumpEntity = heatingDataReadService.getData()`.
   - **Data Types:** The `heatingDataReadService.getData()` method is expected to return a `HeatPumpEntity` object. This entity encapsulates all the relevant heating data.
   - **Dependency:** This step relies on the `heatingDataReadService` dependency.

3. **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block provides crucial error handling.
   - **Potential Failure:** The `heatingDataReadService.getData()` call could fail due to various reasons: network issues, communication errors with the Modbus device, errors within the mock service, or unexpected data formats.
   - **Handling:** If any `Throwable` is caught, the following actions are taken:
     - A descriptive error message (`msg`) is created.
     - The error message and the exception (`e`) are logged using `log.error(msg, e)`, providing valuable debugging information.
     - The caught exception is re-thrown as a `RuntimeException`. This ensures that the error propagates up the call stack, potentially alerting administrators or triggering application-level error handling.

4. **Data Persistence:** If the data retrieval is successful (no exception is thrown), the method proceeds to persist the retrieved `HeatPumpEntity` to the database:
   - **Dependency:** This step relies on the `heatPumpRepository` dependency.
   - **Mechanism:** `heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity)` utilizes the Spring Data JPA repository to save the entity. The repository handles the database interaction (e.g., inserting or updating the record).

5. **Logging & Completion:**  Upon successful persistence, the method logs an informational message:
   - `log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0))`
   - This message includes the elapsed time (`dt`) calculated as `System.currentTimeMillis() - t0`, providing a performance metric. This allows for monitoring the execution time of the polling process.
