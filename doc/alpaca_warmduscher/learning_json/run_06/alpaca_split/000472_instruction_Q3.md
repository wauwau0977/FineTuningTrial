For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
 static emptyInstance() {
   return new BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity(0, '', 0, 0, 0);
 }
```
...What is the purpose of the `static` keyword used before the `emptyInstance` method? What does this method achieve and when might it be useful?
