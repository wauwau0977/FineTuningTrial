The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation signifies that this interface is intended to be a functional interface â€“ meaning it has exactly one abstract method. This annotation isn't strictly *required* for the code to function, but it offers benefits. It acts as a compile-time check to ensure the interface remains a functional interface; the compiler will issue an error if you accidentally add a second abstract method.  More importantly, it signals to the compiler that this interface can be treated as a target for lambda expressions and method references, enabling concise functional programming style code.

Example:

```java
UnsafeRunnable task = () -> {
    // Some code that might throw an Exception
    System.out.println("Running task...");
    if (true) { //Simulate an exception
       throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!");
    }
};

try {
    task.run();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("Task failed: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
