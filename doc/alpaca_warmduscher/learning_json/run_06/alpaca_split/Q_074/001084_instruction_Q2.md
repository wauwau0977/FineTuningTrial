For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavor.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavor.java'... 
Consider the `decode` method. The method includes error handling for invalid characters within the base58 string.  Explain the purpose of the `INDEXES` static initializer block and how it is used within the `decode` method to validate input characters. What would happen if the `INDEXES` array were not initialized?
