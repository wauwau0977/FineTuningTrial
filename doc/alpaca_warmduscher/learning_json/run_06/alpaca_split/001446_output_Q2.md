The primary issue is that the `getCurrent()` method creates a *new* `MemoryInfo` object each time it’s called. While this isn’t inherently thread-unsafe (since each thread gets its own object), it doesn’t provide a way to cache or reuse memory information. More importantly, the method effectively *always* returns the memory information *at the exact moment it’s called*. This means different threads calling `getCurrent()` concurrently could receive slightly different results, even if very close in time. This can lead to inconsistent reporting.

Mitigation strategies include:

1. **Singleton Pattern:** Implement a singleton pattern for the `MemoryInfo` class. This ensures only one instance exists. The `getCurrent()` method would then return a reference to this single instance, which would be periodically updated (e.g., using a scheduled task or a dedicated thread). This ensures consistent reporting.

2. **Caching with Synchronization:** If a singleton isn't ideal, you could cache the `MemoryInfo` object for a short duration. This would involve storing the object and a timestamp of when it was created. Before returning the object, check if the cached object is "fresh" (i.e., created within a reasonable timeframe). If not, recreate it. Synchronization (e.g., using `synchronized` blocks or locks) would be needed around the cache update to prevent race conditions.

3. **ThreadLocal:** If each thread needs its own, isolated view of memory information (less likely in this scenario, but possible), you could use a `ThreadLocal` variable to store the `MemoryInfo` instance for each thread.  This avoids synchronization but adds complexity.

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of the application. For most cases, a singleton pattern with periodic updates is the most straightforward and effective solution.
