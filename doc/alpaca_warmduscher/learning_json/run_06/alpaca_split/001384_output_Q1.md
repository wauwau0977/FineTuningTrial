Currently, the `EmailService` class cleanly adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. Its sole purpose is to receive a subject and content, and then delegate the actual sending of the email to the `MailSend` utility.  If it were to take on additional responsibilities like template generation, it would become tightly coupled to the presentation logic. This reduces reusability and makes testing harder. For example, if template generation fails, it impacts the core function of sending emails. Similarly, integrating user authentication tied to email would add complexity and potentially violate the Open/Closed Principleâ€”changes to authentication would necessitate changes within this service.  Ideally, template generation should be handled by a separate service or component, and authentication handled by an authentication service. This keeps concerns separated and promotes maintainability.
