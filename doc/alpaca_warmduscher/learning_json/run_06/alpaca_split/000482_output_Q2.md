The current approach, while straightforward, has several drawbacks regarding maintainability and scalability. The large number of properties directly initialized in the constructor makes the class rigid and prone to issues when changes occur.

* **Rigidity:** Adding a new property requires modifying the constructor, potentially breaking existing code that relies on the existing constructor signature.  Similarly, removing a property requires changing the constructor and all places where the `HeatingEntity` is instantiated.
* **Readability and Complexity:** The long constructor signature reduces readability and makes it harder to understand the class's purpose.
* **Testability:**  Testing becomes more complex because every test case needs to consider all the properties, even those irrelevant to the specific test.
* **Object Growth:** As the number of properties increases, the class can become bloated and unwieldy.

**Refactoring approach:  Builder Pattern or Record/Interface with optional properties.**

**1. Builder Pattern:**  This would involve creating a separate `HeatingEntityBuilder` class with methods for setting each property individually. The builder would then have a `build()` method that returns the `HeatingEntity` instance. This decouples the instantiation process from the constructor, allowing for more flexibility.

**2. Record/Interface with Optional Properties (TypeScript):**  If using TypeScript, define an interface or record type for the `HeatingEntity` properties where each property is optional.  The constructor would then take a partial object conforming to that interface, allowing clients to only provide the properties they need. This approach is more concise for simple cases.  It can also be combined with default values in the constructor for the optional properties.

**Example (Partial implementation of the Optional Properties approach):**

```typescript
interface HeatingEntityPartial {
  id?: string;
  measurementDate?: Date;
  boilerTemp?: number;
  // ... other properties
}

export class HeatingEntity {
  constructor(data: HeatingEntityPartial) {
    this.id = data.id ?? null;
    this.measurementDate = data.measurementDate ?? new Date();
    this.boilerTemp = data.boilerTemp ?? 0;
    // ... other properties with default values
  }
}
```

The best approach depends on the complexity of the entity and the frequency of changes.  For a frequently changing entity, the Builder Pattern offers more flexibility.  For a relatively stable entity, the optional properties approach can be simpler.  Both options improve maintainability, readability, and testability compared to the current implementation.
