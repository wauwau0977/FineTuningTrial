The `registerLocaleData(localeDeCH)` call is crucial for properly formatting dates, numbers, and currencies according to the conventions of the German (Switzerland) locale.  It provides the necessary linguistic data for the Angular i18n system to function correctly. Without this registration, dates, numbers, and currencies might be displayed incorrectly for users in Switzerland or those who prefer the `de-CH` locale.

This impacts both internationalization (i18n) - preparing the application for multiple languages - and localization (l10n) - adapting the application to a specific locale. Registering the locale data is a necessary step in the localization process.

**Other steps necessary to fully support multiple languages:**

*   **Translation files:** Create translation files (e.g., JSON or XLIFF) that contain the translated text for all user-facing strings in the application.
*   **i18n attributes:** Use the `i18n` attributes in your templates to mark translatable text.  Angular's i18n tooling will extract these strings and generate translation files.
*   **Locale selection:** Implement a mechanism for users to select their preferred language (e.g., a dropdown menu).
*   **Dynamic content:** Handle dynamic content (e.g., dates, numbers, currencies) using Angular's `DatePipe`, `NumberPipe`, and `CurrencyPipe` with the appropriate locale.
*   **Right-to-left (RTL) support:** If the application needs to support RTL languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew), ensure that the layout and styling are properly adapted.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application in all supported languages to ensure that the translations are accurate and the layout is correct.
