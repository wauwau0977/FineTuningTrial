The `getCurrent` method is designed to retrieve the most recent entry for a given weather station. It's a REST endpoint mapped to `/current`.

It accepts a `stationId` as a required request parameter. It then uses the `meteoSwissRepository` to fetch the last entry for that station (limiting the results to a maximum of 1). The `getLastEntries` method likely returns a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.  The code then uses a stream to find the first element of this list. If a result is found (i.e., the list wasn't empty), it returns that `MeteoSwissEntity`. If the list is empty (meaning no entries were found for the station), it returns `null`.
