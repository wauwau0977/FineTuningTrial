Based on the provided test cases, it appears the `service.getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` function calculates the time interval based on the number of data points within a given timeframe, aiming to keep the data density manageable.  More specifically, the tests suggest a threshold-based approach.

*   Around 10 data points in a week results in a daily ("1d") interval.
*   Around 200 data points in a week results in an hourly ("1h") interval.
*   Around 165 data points in a week results in a 4-hourly ("4h") interval.
*   Around 366 data points in a year results in a daily ("1d") interval.
*   Around 360 data points in a year results in a 3-daily ("3d") interval.

The inference is that the function seems to determine the interval by effectively dividing the total time range by a maximum acceptable number of data points. If the number of data points exceeds a certain threshold for the given time range, it reduces the interval length (e.g., from daily to hourly). The tests showcase a non-linear relationship, where a significant jump in data points necessitates a coarser granularity (e.g. from 4h to 1h). The tests suggest the function aims to avoid having too many data points crammed into a single time unit, dynamically adjusting the interval to maintain a manageable density.
