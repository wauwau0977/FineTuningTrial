```typescript
constructor(private clientIdService: ClientIdService) { }
```

The constructor receives a single parameter: `clientIdService` of type `ClientIdService`. This service is injected into the `MyHttpInterceptor` class via dependency injection. Its purpose is to provide access to the client ID, which is subsequently added as a header to all outgoing HTTP requests within the `intercept` method. The `private` keyword declares this service as a private member variable, ensuring it's only accessible within the class.
