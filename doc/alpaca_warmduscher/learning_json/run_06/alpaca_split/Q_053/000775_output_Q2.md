The `seq_id` field is crucial for correctly grouping and analyzing measurements related to individual compressor runs, addressing the "gaps and island problem" mentioned in the comments.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **The Problem:**  Without a way to uniquely identify continuous compressor operation periods, the query would treat all measurements within the date range as a single continuous operation.  This would lead to inaccurate statistics, especially when the compressor is frequently turned on and off. The `seq_id` is derived using a window function ( `row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date) - row_number() over (partition by di10compressor1 order by measurement_date)` ) which increments whenever the `di10compressor1` (compressor state) changes. This essentially assigns a unique identifier to each consecutive sequence of measurements where the compressor is either on or off.

2. **How it Solves the Problem:**  By grouping by `seq_id` *along with* `di10compressor1`, the query isolates the statistics for *each* individual compressor run.  This means the `avg(sole_in)`, `avg(sole_out)`, `min(sole_in)`, etc., are calculated only for the measurements belonging to a single, uninterrupted compressor operation period.

3. **Contribution to Logic:**  Without `seq_id` in the `group by`, the query would effectively average the `sole_in` and `sole_out` temperatures across *all* measurements within the date range, including periods where the compressor is off, giving a misleading result. The `seq_id` enables the query to compute meaningful statistics *per compressor run*, allowing for accurate analysis of the heat pump's performance during operation. It also enables the query to ignore the startup and shutdown phases by filtering based on the time since the compressor toggled on/off.
