The `CrudRepository` interface from Spring Data JPA provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database access.  By extending this interface, `SessionRequestRepository` automatically gains methods for interacting with the database table associated with the `SessionRequest` entity, without needing to manually implement those methods. It simplifies database interactions significantly. It’s a core component of Spring’s repository pattern, enabling data persistence with minimal boilerplate code.
