The `lastUserActivationTime` variable stores the timestamp of the last time the user interacted with the application. This is used to determine if the data displayed in the chart is still relevant or if it needs to be refreshed.

The `adjustTimeAndReload()` method calculates the time elapsed since the last user interaction (`lastActiveSinceSeconds`). If this elapsed time exceeds 180 seconds (3 minutes), the `updateDatesRequired` flag is set to `true`. This indicates that the data should be refreshed. 

When `updateDatesRequired` is `true`, the method updates the `customFromDate` and `customToDate` values in the form to display data from the past 24 hours.  The `customFromDateTimePart` and `customToDateTimePart` are set to the current hour and the next hour respectively, essentially showing data for the current day. The `lastUserActivationTime` is then updated to the current time (`now`), and the `calculateAutoInterval()` method is called to re-evaluate the chart's interval settings. Finally, the `myReload()` method is called to actually fetch and display the new data.

The 180-second threshold is likely a compromise between keeping the data reasonably up-to-date and avoiding excessive API calls and UI updates. It assumes that if the user hasn't interacted with the application for 3 minutes, the data displayed might be stale and should be refreshed. This helps provide a more responsive and accurate experience for the user.
