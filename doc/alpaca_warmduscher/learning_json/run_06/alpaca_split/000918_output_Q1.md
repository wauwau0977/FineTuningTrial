The limited information included in the `toString()` method hinders effective debugging and logging. When an exception occurs or when needing to trace the flow of execution, a complete representation of the objectâ€™s state is invaluable. The current implementation provides only a partial view, making it difficult to diagnose issues quickly and accurately.

A better approach would be to include *all* of the fields in the `toString()` method, or to leverage a utility like `ToStringBuilder` from Apache Commons Lang or a similar functionality provided by a framework like Lombok. These tools automatically generate a comprehensive string representation of all fields, making debugging and logging significantly easier and less error-prone. This ensures all relevant data is readily available when investigating issues.
