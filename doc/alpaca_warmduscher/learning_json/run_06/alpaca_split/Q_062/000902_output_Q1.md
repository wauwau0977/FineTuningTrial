Initializing `sessionCreateDate` with `new Date()` directly in the field declaration means that all instances of `SessionDevice` created at roughly the same time will have the same creation timestamp. This can lead to several issues:

*   **Loss of Granularity:** You won't be able to accurately track the actual creation time of each individual session. It's essentially a shared timestamp for all instances created around the same moment.
*   **Testing Difficulties:** Unit tests that rely on unique timestamps will fail or be unreliable.
*   **Concurrency Issues:** In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads might create `SessionDevice` instances simultaneously. They would all share the *same* timestamp because `new Date()` is called during the object's construction.

**How to Address It:**

The best solution is to avoid initializing the field directly in the class declaration. Instead:

1.  **Initialize in the Constructor:**  Move the `new Date()` call into the constructor of the `SessionDevice` class. This ensures that each instance gets its own unique timestamp at the time of object creation.

```java
public SessionDevice() {
    this.sessionCreateDate = new Date();
}
```

2.  **Consider Dependency Injection:** For more advanced control and testability, you could inject a `Clock` or `TimeProvider` interface into the constructor. This allows you to easily mock the current time during testing and provides greater flexibility.

By initializing `sessionCreateDate` within the constructor, each instance will receive a unique timestamp, resolving the issues outlined above.
