For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/MemoryInfo.java' with name 'MemoryInfo.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
public long getAvailableProcessors() {
    return availableProcessors;
}
public void setAvailableProcessors(long availableProcessors) {
    this.availableProcessors = availableProcessors;
}
```
What is the purpose of having both a getter and a setter method for the `availableProcessor` field, and what design principle does this demonstrate?
