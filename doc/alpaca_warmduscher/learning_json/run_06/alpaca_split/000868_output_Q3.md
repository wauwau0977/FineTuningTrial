The subquery within `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` is used to group the data from the `meteo_swiss` table into fixed time intervals, measured in seconds.  It calculates `groupid` by dividing the number of seconds since the epoch (obtained using `extract(epoch from temperature_measure_date)`) by the `group_every_nth_second` parameter.  The `round()` function ensures that all timestamps falling within the same interval are assigned the same `groupid`.

The `group_every_nth_second` parameter determines the size of these time intervals. For example, if `group_every_nth_second` is 60, the data will be grouped into 60-second intervals. If itâ€™s 300, then 5 minute intervals are created. The subquery then selects all columns from the `meteo_swiss` table along with this calculated `groupid`.

The outer query then groups the results by both `groupid` and `station_id`.  This means that statistics will be calculated for each station *within each fixed time interval*. This approach allows for the creation of time series data with a consistent resolution. Essentially it's a form of bucketing the data by time.
