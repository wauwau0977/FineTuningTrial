Constructor injection, as used here, offers several key benefits over field or setter injection in Spring. Primarily, it ensures that the dependencies (`MailSend` in this case) are required for the class to be instantiated. This makes the dependencies explicit and prevents the class from being in an invalid state due to missing dependencies. It also promotes immutability â€“ the `mailSend` field is initialized once during construction and cannot be changed later.

Compared to field injection, constructor injection is easier to test because you can easily mock or stub the `MailSend` dependency during unit tests by simply providing a mock instance through the constructor. Setter injection introduces potential race conditions if multiple threads are creating the object concurrently before the setter is called.

In terms of testability, this makes the `EmailService` highly unit-testable. During testing, we can inject a mock `MailSend` object that returns predefined responses, allowing us to verify the behavior of the `EmailService` without actually sending emails. This provides faster, isolated, and more reliable tests.
