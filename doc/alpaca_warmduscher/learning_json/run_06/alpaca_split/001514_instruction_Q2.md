For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java'... 
Consider the `checkString` method. The `randomBytes` array is created using `new Random().nextBytes(randomBytes)`. What potential security implications could arise from using a simple `Random` number generator for generating the random bytes if these bytes were intended for security-sensitive applications? How could this be mitigated?
