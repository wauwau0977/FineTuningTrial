According to the provided test cases, if the input `rawValue` is 0, the expected output is 0. 

This is significant in the context of Modbus communication because 0 often represents a specific condition or baseline value.  For example, it could indicate that a sensor is not active, or that a particular heating element is off, or simply a zero value for a measured temperature. Ensuring that 0 is correctly interpreted is crucial for accurate data representation and system control.  It's a common boundary condition that needs to be explicitly tested.
