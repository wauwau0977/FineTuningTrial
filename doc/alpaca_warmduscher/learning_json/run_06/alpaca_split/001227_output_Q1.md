This interface promotes loose coupling by defining *what* actions should be taken before and after an operation on type `T`, without dictating *how* those actions are implemented.  Instead of a mutex directly containing logic for pre/post processing, it relies on external implementations of `Hooks<T>`.  This means the mutex core logic remains independent of specific pre/post processing needs.

Benefits include:

*   **Flexibility:** Different types of `T` can trigger different side effects. For example, `T` could represent a database transaction, a file lock, or a network connection, each requiring unique 'before' and 'after' actions.  Different hook implementations can be provided for each scenario.
*   **Testability:** Mock implementations of `Hooks<T>` can be easily created for unit testing the mutex without involving actual pre/post processing logic.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes to pre/post processing logic don't require modifying the mutex core.
*   **Extensibility:** New hook behaviors can be added without impacting existing code.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps the mutex focused on its core responsibility (locking/unlocking) and delegates side effects to specialized hook implementations.
