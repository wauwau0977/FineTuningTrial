These comments explain the mechanism by which Angular manages environment-specific configurations during the build process. They highlight that the Angular CLI, when running the `ng build` command, can automatically replace the contents of `environment.ts` with a different file (typically `environment.prod.ts`, `environment.staging.ts`, etc.).

`angular.json` acts as the central configuration file for Angular projects. Specifically, the `fileReplacements` array within the `build` section of `angular.json` defines the rules for these file replacements.  Each entry in the `fileReplacements` array specifies:

* **`replace`**: The path to the file to be replaced (in this case, `environment.ts`).
* **`with`**: The path to the replacement file (e.g., `environment.prod.ts`).

How the Angular CLI utilizes this information during the build process:

1. **Build Command:** When you run `ng build`, the CLI reads the `angular.json` file.
2. **Configuration:** The CLI checks if a build configuration (e.g., `production`, `staging`) is specified. If not, it defaults to the default configuration.
3. **File Replacement:** The CLI then examines the `fileReplacements` array for the specified configuration.
4. **Replacement Execution:** For each entry in `fileReplacements`, the CLI replaces the source file (`replace`) with the contents of the target file (`with`).
5. **Build with Replaced Files:**  The Angular application is then built using the replaced files.

This mechanism allows for different configurations to be used for different environments without requiring changes to the application code.  Itâ€™s a key feature for managing deployments across various stages (development, testing, production).
