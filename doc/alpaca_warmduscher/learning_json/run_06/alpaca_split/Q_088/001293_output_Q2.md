Including "*" in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header is a significant security risk. It effectively allows the client to specify *any* header, potentially including sensitive ones like `Authorization` or custom headers containing confidential data. While `X-Requested-With` used to be a common header for AJAX requests, it's now largely deprecated and can be bypassed, adding little actual security.

A better, more secure approach is to explicitly list only the headers that your API expects and supports. For example, if your API expects `Content-Type`, `Accept`, and a custom header called `X-Custom-Header`, the header should be:

```java
response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Accept, X-Custom-Header");
```

This whitelisting approach limits the potential attack surface by preventing malicious clients from sending arbitrary headers that could be exploited. It enforces a stricter security policy and improves the overall robustness of the API.
