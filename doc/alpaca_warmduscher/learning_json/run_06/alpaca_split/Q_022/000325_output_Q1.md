The `AboutComponent` is designed to display build timestamp information – one for the client (the Angular application itself) and one for the server (presumably a backend component providing heating data). It achieves this by reading the client build timestamp from the `environment` file at component instantiation. The server build timestamp is retrieved asynchronously via the `HeatingDataService`.

Dependency injection is utilized through the component’s constructor. The `HeatingDataService` is injected as a private property, allowing the component to utilize its methods (`getServerInfo()`) without needing to create an instance of it directly. This promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability.

The use of `@ts-ignore` is a red flag. It suppresses a TypeScript error, likely because the type definition of `info` (returned by `heatingDataService.getServerInfo()`) doesn't include a `buildTimestampServer` property. This circumvents type safety.  The ideal solution is to properly define the type of the `info` object to include `buildTimestampServer`.  If modifying the server response is not possible, a type assertion could be used (e.g., `(info as any).buildTimestampServer`), but this is less ideal as it still sidesteps the type checking.  A more robust solution might involve adding a conditional check before accessing `info.buildTimestampServer` to prevent runtime errors if the property is missing, but that is a workaround, not a fix.
