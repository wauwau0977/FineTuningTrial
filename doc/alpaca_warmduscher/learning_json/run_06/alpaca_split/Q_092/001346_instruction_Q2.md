For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MySessionFilter.java' with name 'MySessionFilter.java'... 
Considering the `isSessionRelevantRequest` method, what are the potential drawbacks of using a `Stream.of(...).noneMatch()` approach for excluding certain file extensions and paths? Could this approach become problematic as the application grows and requires more exclusions? Explain and suggest a more maintainable alternative.
