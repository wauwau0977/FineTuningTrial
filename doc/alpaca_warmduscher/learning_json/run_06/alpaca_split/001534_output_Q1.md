The `testDuplicates` method relies on the probability that a collision *hasn't* occurred within 10,000 generated UUIDs. This is a statistical approach, and the probability of a collision increases as the number of generated UUIDs increases, even with a well-designed UUID generation algorithm. It's entirely possible, though unlikely with a good algorithm and a relatively small number of iterations, that a collision *could* occur and go undetected. 

A more robust approach would involve generating a significantly larger number of UUIDs (e.g., millions) and *then* checking for duplicates. However, even this isnâ€™t foolproof, as it's still a probabilistic test. A truly thorough test would involve mathematically analyzing the UUID generation algorithm's collision resistance and potentially comparing it against established UUID standards. Another improvement would be to leverage a database with a unique constraint. Inserting each generated UUID into a table with a unique index would immediately expose any duplicates. This, while more resource-intensive, provides definitive proof of uniqueness (within the generated set).
