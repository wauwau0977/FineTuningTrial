The `static` keyword before `emptyInstance` indicates that this method belongs to the `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` class itself, and *not* to instances of the class. This means you call it using `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.emptyInstance()` rather than on an object of that type.  It achieves the creation of a default or "empty" instance of the `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` with pre-defined, likely default or zeroed-out, values for all the properties (0 for numbers, empty string for text). This is useful when you need a baseline object to start with, or to provide a default value in cases where a valid instance isn't immediately available from a data source. It provides a controlled way to ensure a valid object exists, preventing potential `null` or `undefined` errors.
