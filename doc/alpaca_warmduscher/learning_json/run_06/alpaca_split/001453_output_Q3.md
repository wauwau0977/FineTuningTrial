The getter (`getAvailableProcessor()`) and setter (`setAvailableProcessor()`) methods provide controlled access to the `availableProcessor` field. The getter allows external code to *read* the value of the number of available processors, while the setter allows external code to *modify* that value. This pattern is a fundamental aspect of encapsulation, one of the core principles of object-oriented programming.

Encapsulation hides the internal state (the `availableProcessor` field) of the object and provides a controlled interface (the getter and setter methods) to interact with that state. This allows the class to maintain data integrity by controlling how the value is set, and it allows for future changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code that uses the class.  For example, the setter could include validation logic to ensure the value is within a valid range. Without getter/setter pairs, the field would likely be public, allowing direct and uncontrolled access and violating encapsulation principles.
