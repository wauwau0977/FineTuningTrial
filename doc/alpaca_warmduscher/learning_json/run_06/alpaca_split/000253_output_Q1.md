A valuable test case would be to test with a *very low number of data points* – for example, 1 or 2 data points over a week. The existing tests all focus on relatively high data point counts.  Testing with a very sparse dataset is important because the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method might not handle this edge case gracefully. It’s possible the logic is designed assuming a certain minimum data density.  For instance, it might return an invalid interval, throw an error, or default to an inappropriate interval if there isn't enough data to accurately determine an optimal one. The test should verify that in this case, the method either handles the sparse data gracefully (e.g., returning a very long interval) or throws an informative error message, preventing unexpected behavior in the application.
