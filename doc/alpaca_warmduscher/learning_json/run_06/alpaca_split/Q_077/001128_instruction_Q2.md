For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Physics.java' with name 'Physics.java'... 
Consider this part of the method: `(17.67 * temperature) / (temperature + 243.5)`. What potential issue could arise from this division if `temperature` is equal to `-243.5`? How would you prevent this from happening in a production environment?
