You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter for a Spring Boot application. It allows requests from any origin to access the serverâ€™s resources by setting appropriate HTTP headers. This is crucial for enabling client-side applications (e.g., JavaScript running in a browser) to make requests to a different domain than the one serving the web application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java
- **Class Name(s):** `CorsFilter`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code's primary operation is to intercept all incoming HTTP requests and add CORS-related HTTP headers to the response.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** Incoming HTTP requests.
    - **Outputs:** HTTP responses with added CORS headers.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `doFilter` method is invoked for each incoming request.
    2. The response object is cast to `HttpServletResponse`.
    3. The following headers are added to the response:
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Set to `*` to allow requests from any origin.
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Set to `true` to allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers) to be sent with cross-origin requests.
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Specifies the headers that are allowed in the actual request.
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies the HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS) allowed for cross-origin requests.
    4. The filter chain is invoked to pass the request to the next filter or the target resource.
- **External Interactions**: None beyond standard HTTP request/response handling within the servlet container.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  The code does not explicitly handle any edge cases.  Allowing all origins (`*`) is generally not recommended for production environments due to security implications.  

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The filter adds minimal overhead to each request.  Header addition is a fast operation.
- **Scalability**:  The filter is stateless and scales well with increased load.
- **Security**: Allowing all origins (`*`) presents a security risk. This should be reviewed and restricted in a production environment to specific, trusted origins.
- **Maintainability**: The code is simple and easy to understand.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The filter is reliable as it performs a straightforward operation.
- **Usability**: Easy to integrate within a Spring Boot application via component scanning.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`CorsFilter` Class:** This class implements the `Filter` interface and handles the CORS header addition.
- **`init()` function**: This function is called when the filter is initialized. Currently it does nothing.
- **`doFilter()` function**: This function adds the CORS headers to the HTTP response.
- **`destroy()` function**: This function is called when the filter is destroyed. Currently it does nothing.
- **Error Handling:** No explicit error handling is implemented. Any exceptions during header addition will likely be handled by the servlet container.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Basic Java syntax
- Servlet API (provided by the servlet container)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection and component scanning via the `@Component` annotation.
- **Servlet API**: Provided by the container (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** Not applicable, performance is already good.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Replace `*` with specific, trusted origins in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to improve security.  Consider adding logic to dynamically determine allowed origins based on the requesting domain.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The filter is stateless and scales well. No specific changes are needed.
- **Configuration:** Allow configuration of allowed origins, methods, and headers through application properties or environment variables to avoid hardcoding.
- **Logging:** Add logging to track CORS requests and any potential issues.
