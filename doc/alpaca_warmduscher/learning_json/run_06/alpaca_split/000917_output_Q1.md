Using a UUID as a primary key offers several advantages.  It allows for the generation of unique identifiers across distributed systems without requiring central coordination, which is crucial for scalability and avoids potential conflicts. It also offers some degree of security through obscurity, making it harder for attackers to guess valid IDs.

However, UUIDs have disadvantages. They are larger in size (typically 36 characters) than integers, leading to increased storage space and potentially slower indexing.  UUIDs also arenâ€™t inherently sequential, which can lead to fragmentation in B-tree indexes, potentially reducing performance. Auto-incrementing integers are smaller, more efficient for indexing due to their sequential nature, and generally faster for lookups.  The choice depends on the application's requirements; if distributed uniqueness and scalability are paramount, UUIDs are a good choice, but if performance and storage efficiency are critical and the application is not distributed, auto-incrementing integers are often preferable.
