To handle failures when obtaining data, I would implement a robust error handling and reporting mechanism within the concrete implementation of `MeteoDataService`. Here’s how I would approach it:

1. **Try-Catch Blocks:**  Wrap the data retrieval logic (e.g., network calls, API requests) within `try-catch` blocks to catch potential exceptions like `IOException`, `JSONException`, or custom exceptions specific to the MeteoSwiss API.

2. **Custom Exception:** Define a custom exception class, for example, `MeteoDataException`, extending `Exception`. This allows me to encapsulate specific error codes and messages related to data retrieval failures, providing more meaningful information to the calling code.

3. **Logging:** Log all errors with appropriate severity levels (e.g., `ERROR`, `WARN`) using a logging framework (e.g., SLF4J, Log4j). The logs should include details about the error, timestamp, and relevant context.

4. **Error Communication:**  There are a few ways to communicate failures to the calling code:

   *   **Exception Propagation:**  Re-throw the `MeteoDataException` (or a wrapped version of it) to allow the calling code to handle the error. This is a straightforward approach but requires the calling code to have appropriate `try-catch` blocks.

   *   **Return Value:** Return an empty `List<MeteoSwissEntity>` if the data retrieval fails.  This is a simpler approach but doesn’t provide much information about the error. In this case, the calling code would need to check the size of the list to determine if the retrieval was successful. It would be best to also have a logging statement upon return of the empty list.

   *   **Error Codes/Status Objects:** Return a dedicated status object or error code along with the data. This provides a more structured way to communicate errors and allows the calling code to handle different types of failures gracefully.

5. **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., temporary network issues). This can improve the resilience of the service and reduce the impact of intermittent failures.  However, avoid infinite retries – limit the number of retries and/or implement a circuit breaker pattern.

The choice of how to communicate errors depends on the specific requirements of the application. For critical failures, re-throwing an exception is generally the best approach. For less critical failures, returning an error code or an empty list might be sufficient.
