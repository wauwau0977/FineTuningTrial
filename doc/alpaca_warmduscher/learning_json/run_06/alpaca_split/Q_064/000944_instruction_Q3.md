For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
public interface BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek {
   Integer getDayOfWeekStartingMonday();
   String getDayOfWeekText();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease();
   Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1();
}
```

What data types are used for each of the properties being tracked by this interface, and what does this suggest about the nature of the data being represented?
