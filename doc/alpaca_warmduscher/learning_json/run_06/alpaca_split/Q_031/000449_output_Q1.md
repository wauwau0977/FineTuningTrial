The `ofWebService()` method handles potentially missing data by checking if the `data` argument is null. If it is, it returns the `emptyInstance()`. This prevents errors that might occur if you tried to access properties of a null object. The implication is that any hour with missing data will be represented by an entity with all values set to zero.

An alternative approach would be to use optional chaining or the nullish coalescing operator to provide default values for each property individually. For example:

```typescript
static ofWebService(data: any): BoilerStatsByHourEntity {
  return new BoilerStatsByHourEntity(
    data?.hourOfTheDay ?? 0,
    data?.sumBoilerDiffIncrease ?? 0,
    data?.sumBoilerDiffDecrease ?? 0,
    data?.numOfStatisticRecords1 ?? 0,
  );
}
```

This approach allows you to handle missing values for individual properties without necessarily creating an entirely "empty" entity, potentially preserving some meaningful information if only certain fields are missing.
