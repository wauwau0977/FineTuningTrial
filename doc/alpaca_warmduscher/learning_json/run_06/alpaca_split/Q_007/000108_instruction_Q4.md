Describe the purpose and functionality of the `<footer>` element in this HTML file. Detail the structure within it, including the `mat-toolbar`, `mat-toolbar-row`, and the `button` elements. Specifically explain how `routerLink` and `routerLinkActive` attributes are used within the buttons, and what each button navigates to. Finally, explain the purpose of the `mat-icon` and `toolbarText` spans within each button.
