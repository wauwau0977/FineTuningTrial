Currently, the `AppComponent` handles application layout, logging a message, and scheduling a full-page refresh. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Here's how we could refactor it:

1.  **`RefreshSchedulerService`:** Extract the refresh scheduling logic into a dedicated service. This service would handle the `interval` observable and call a method on another component/service to perform the refresh.  This makes the refresh mechanism reusable and testable.

    ```typescript
    // refresh-scheduler.service.ts
    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
    import { interval } from 'rxjs';
    import { environment } from '../environments/environment';
    import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; // Or a more appropriate service

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class RefreshSchedulerService {

      constructor(private appComponent: AppComponent) {} //Dependency Injection

      startRefreshScheduler() {
        interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000).subscribe(() => {
          this.appComponent.myFullPageRefresh();
        });
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Remove Refresh Logic from `AppComponent`:** The `AppComponent` itself should become primarily responsible for layout and potentially application-level state. It would receive a reference to the `RefreshSchedulerService` during construction and initiate the schedule.

    ```typescript
    // app.component.ts
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { RefreshSchedulerService } from './refresh-scheduler.service';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
    })
    export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
      title = 'thserver-client';

      constructor(private refreshScheduler: RefreshSchedulerService) {}

      ngOnInit() {
        this.refreshScheduler.startRefreshScheduler();
        console.log("Setup the page refresh mechanism all " + environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds + " seconds.");
      }

      myFullPageRefresh(): void {
        window.location.reload();
      }
    }
    ```

This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable, testable, and reusable.  The layout component stays focused on presentation, and the refresh scheduling is handled by a dedicated service.  We can also easily add new refresh strategies (e.g., partial updates) without modifying the layout component.
