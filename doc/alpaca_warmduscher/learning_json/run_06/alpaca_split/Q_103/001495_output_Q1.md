The `getSignedNumber` method handles input values from 0 to 65535. While the test cases cover this entire range, a potential issue would arise if the input value were outside this range. Integer overflow could occur if the input is greater than 65535, leading to unexpected or incorrect results. Similarly, if a negative integer is provided as input, the method's behavior is undefined and may lead to incorrect interpretations. The test suite doesnâ€™t cover those scenarios, implying those cases are not handled or not expected, and could represent a potential vulnerability or bug.
