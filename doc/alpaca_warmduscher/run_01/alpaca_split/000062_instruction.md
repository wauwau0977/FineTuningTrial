You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `MeteoDataMockImpl`, is a mock implementation of the `MeteoDataService` interface within the 'Warmduscher' project. It's designed to provide simulated weather data for testing and development purposes, specifically when running the application with the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile. It generates a single `MeteoSwissEntity` with values derived from the current time, providing mock wind gust speed and temperature readings.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataMockImpl.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoDataMockImpl`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Generate mock `MeteoSwissEntity` data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:** This class does not directly accept user input. It outputs a `List<MeteoSwissEntity>` containing mock weather data.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1.  The `getData()` method is called.
    2.  The elapsed time since `t0` (initialized to 1ms before current time) is calculated.
    3.  A `MeteoSwissEntity` is created and populated with:
        -   Current timestamp for `createDate` and measurement dates.
        -   A hardcoded station name ("Kloten") and ID ("KLO").
        -   Wind gust speed calculated from the elapsed time.
        -   Temperature calculated from the elapsed time.
    4.  A `List` containing this single entity is returned.
- **External Interactions:** None.  This implementation is self-contained and does not interact with databases, APIs, or external files.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** No specific error handling is implemented. If the system time is manipulated, the generated data will be affected, but no exception is thrown.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The `getData()` method is expected to execute quickly, as it performs simple calculations and object creation.  The execution time should be negligible for most use cases.
- **Scalability:** This class is not designed for high scalability, as it generates a fixed amount of data.
- **Security:** Not applicable, as the class does not handle sensitive data or external interactions.
- **Maintainability:** The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, but could benefit from comments explaining the data generation logic.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The class is reliable as it is self-contained, but availability depends on the Spring context.
- **Usability:** Easy to use within the context of the 'Warmduscher' application when running with the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile.
- **Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements are applicable.

## 5. Key Components

- **`getData()` Function:** Generates and returns a list containing a single `MeteoSwissEntity` with mock data.
- **Data Generation Logic:** Uses the current time to calculate wind gust speed and temperature.
- **`MeteoSwissEntity`:**  The data model for the mock weather data.
- **`t0` Variable:** Used as a reference time for calculating elapsed time.
- **`init()` Function:** Currently empty, but could be extended for potential initialization logic.
- **Error Handling:** Minimal - no explicit exception handling.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **`Date`**: Used for representing timestamps.
- **`List`**: Used for returning a collection of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.
- **`System.currentTimeMillis()`**: Used for obtaining the current system time.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for calculating the mock data values.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection and component management (via `@Component` annotation).
- **SLF4J**: Used for logging information (via `Logger` and `LoggerFactory`).
- **Spring Profiles**: Used to activate this implementation only when the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile is active (via `@Profile` annotation).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.data.meteoswiss.MeteoDataService`**: Interface this class implements.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissEntity`**: The data model for weather data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.Profiles`**:  A class presumably defining the application profiles (including `SENSOR_MOCK`).

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** Not a significant concern given the simplicity of the code.
- **Code Readability:** Adding comments explaining the logic behind the data generation (the purpose of the calculations) would improve readability.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations:** If the requirement changed to generate a larger number of data points, consider using a more efficient data structure or a streaming approach.
- **Testability:** Add unit tests to verify the generated data falls within expected ranges and that the calculations are correct.
- **Configuration:** Allow the base time (`t0`) and the scaling factors in the data generation formulas to be configurable, making the mock data more flexible.
