For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/ThException.java' with name 'ThException.java' we have the following question: 
Assume you're tasked with adding logging functionality to the `ThException` class.  Describe how you would modify the class to include logging of the exception message and, if available, the stack trace of the original cause. Detail *exactly* what would be logged and where (e.g., to a file, to the console).  You don't need to provide the actual code, just a very detailed description of the logging implementation.
