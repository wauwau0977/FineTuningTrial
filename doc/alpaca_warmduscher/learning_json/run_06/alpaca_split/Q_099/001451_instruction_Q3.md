For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/MemoryInfo.java' with name 'MemoryInfo.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
public MemoryInfo(long totalMemoryKb, long maxMemoryKb, long freeMemoryKb) {
    this.totalMemoryKb = totalMemoryKb;
    this.maxMemoryKb = maxMemoryKb;
    this.freeMemoryKb = freeMemoryKb;
}
```
What is the purpose of this constructor, and how does it relate to the class's overall responsibility?
