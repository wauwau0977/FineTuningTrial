The downside of not unsubscribing from an `interval` observable within a component is a potential memory leak. The `interval` observable will continue to emit values and call `myReload()` every 10 seconds indefinitely, even if the component is destroyed or navigated away from. This means the `myReload` function, and potentially its associated resources, will continue to execute, consuming memory and potentially impacting application performance. 

To mitigate this, the subscription should be stored in a variable (e.g., `private reloadSubscription: Subscription;`) within the component and unsubscribed from in the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook. This ensures that the observable is properly cleaned up when the component is no longer needed.  The code would look something like this:

```typescript
private reloadSubscription: Subscription;

ngOnInit(): void {
  // ... other initialization
  this.reloadSubscription = interval(10000).subscribe(val => {
    this.myReload();
  });
}

ngOnDestroy(): void {
  if (this.reloadSubscription) {
    this.reloadSubscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```
