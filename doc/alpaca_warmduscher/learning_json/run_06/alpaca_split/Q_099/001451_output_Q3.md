This constructor allows for the creation of `MemoryInfo` objects with pre-defined memory values. It initializes the `totalMemoryKb`, `maxMemoryKb`, and `freeMemoryKb` instance variables with the values provided as arguments. This is useful for scenarios where memory information isn’t being retrieved directly from `Runtime` (like in the `getCurrent()` method), but is instead being supplied from another source – perhaps for testing, configuration, or receiving data from another system. The class’s overall responsibility is to encapsulate and provide information about system memory and processors, and this constructor is one way of fulfilling that responsibility by allowing external specification of the memory data.
