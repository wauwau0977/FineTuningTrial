The `@Repository` annotation is a Spring stereotype annotation. It indicates that the class (`MeteoSwissRepository`) is a repository component responsible for data access. While not strictly *required* for the code to function (the interface would still be usable by Spring), it provides several benefits:

1. **Component Scanning:** Spring's component scanning mechanism automatically detects classes annotated with `@Repository` during application startup. This allows Spring to manage the repository as a bean within its application context.

2. **Exception Translation:** Spring's exception translation mechanism automatically translates database-specific exceptions (e.g., `SQLException`) into Spring's own DataAccessExceptions. This provides a more consistent and manageable error handling approach throughout the application. It helps to decouple the application from specific database technologies.

3. **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** The `@Repository` annotation clearly signals the purpose of the class, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. It serves as documentation and a signal to other developers about the component's role.

In essence, `@Repository` promotes a cleaner, more organized, and more robust data access layer within the application, aligning with Spring's overall principles of dependency injection and separation of concerns.
