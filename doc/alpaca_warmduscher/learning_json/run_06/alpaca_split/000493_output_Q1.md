The `emptyInstance()` method serves to create a default, essentially "blank" instance of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class. All properties are initialized with empty strings or default values (0 for numbers, `new Date()` for dates). This is useful for a few scenarios: providing a starting point when a valid `MeteoSwissEntity` hasn't yet been created, serving as a return value when data is missing or unavailable (avoiding null or undefined values), or initializing UI elements before real data arrives. It promotes type safety and predictable behavior by ensuring a valid object is always present, even if it lacks meaningful data.
