For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts'... 
The `get` method uses a private `cache` object (`private cache = {};`). What are the potential drawbacks of using a simple JavaScript object for caching, especially in a multi-threaded or concurrent environment (even though Angular itself handles a lot of concurrency)? What alternatives could be considered to improve the robustness and scalability of this caching mechanism?
