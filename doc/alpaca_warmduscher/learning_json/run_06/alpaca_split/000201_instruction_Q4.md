For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.ts' with name 'client-id.service.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `constructor` method in the `ClientIdService` class. Detail how it attempts to retrieve or generate a client ID, and explain the fallback mechanism employed if the primary method fails. Include how and where the generated or retrieved ID is stored.
