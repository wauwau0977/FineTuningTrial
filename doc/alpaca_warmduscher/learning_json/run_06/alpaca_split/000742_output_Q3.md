These `@Value` annotations are part of Spring's dependency injection mechanism. They are used to inject values from a configuration source (typically a `application.properties` or `application.yml` file) into the corresponding fields of the `MeteoDataServiceImpl` class. 

Specifically:

*   `@Value("${thserver.meteoSwiss.urlSunshine}")` injects the value of the property `thserver.meteoSwiss.urlSunshine` from the configuration file into the `urlSunshine` string field. This URL likely points to the MeteoSwiss API endpoint for sunshine data.
*   `@Value("${thserver.meteoSwiss.urlTemperature}")` does the same for temperature data.
*   `@Value("${thserver.meteoSwiss.urlWindGust}")` does the same for wind gust data.
*   `@Value("${thserver.meteoSwiss.stationIds}")` injects a list of station IDs, presumably from the configuration file, into the `stationIds` list.

This approach allows for external configuration of the service without modifying the code, enhancing flexibility and making it easier to adapt to different environments or data sources. It promotes loose coupling and adheres to the principles of dependency injection.
