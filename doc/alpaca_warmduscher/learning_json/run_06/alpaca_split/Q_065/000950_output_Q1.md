The commented-out methods suggest that at some point, calculating and storing max, min, and average boiler temperatures were considered as part of this analytics entity. Reasons for their removal or commenting out could include:

*   **Performance:** Calculating these values might have been computationally expensive, especially if dealing with a large volume of data.  Storing them directly added storage overhead.
*   **Data Redundancy:**  These values could potentially be derived from the raw data used to calculate `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` and `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`. Storing derived data introduces redundancy and potential inconsistencies if the source data changes.
*   **Reporting Requirements:** The original reporting or analytics requirements may have changed, removing the need for these specific metrics.
*   **Complexity:** Adding these values might have increased the complexity of the data model and queries without a proportional benefit.

Re-introducing them would provide direct access to these commonly needed statistics, simplifying reporting and analysis. However, it would also reintroduce the performance and storage costs, and the need to ensure data consistency if they are derived values. A good approach might be to calculate them on-demand within a query or report rather than storing them persistently unless their performance impact is minimal and they're frequently needed.
