I would expect the output to be 32767. 

This value represents the maximum positive value representable in a 16-bit signed integer. A 16-bit signed integer uses one bit for the sign (positive or negative) and the remaining 15 bits to represent the magnitude of the number. This allows for a range of -32768 to 32767.  The test explicitly confirms this upper boundary is correctly handled, which is important for ensuring the code accurately reflects the range of possible values from the Modbus device.
