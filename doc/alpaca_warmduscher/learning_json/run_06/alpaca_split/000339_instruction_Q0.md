You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below## IT Specification

### 1. Summary

This component displays various charts related to boiler performance and environmental data. It allows users to select a date range, adjust the number of data points displayed, and view charts representing temperature differences, statistics, and other relevant metrics. The component retrieves data and renders it using Highcharts. The overall purpose is to provide a visual representation of boiler operation and efficiency.

### 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.html`
- **Class Name(s):** `boiler-chart.component` (associated TypeScript class)

### 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Display multiple charts related to boiler performance.
    - Allow date range selection for data filtering.
    - Adjust the number of data points displayed on charts.
    - Fetch and render chart data using Highcharts.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** Date range (start and end), number of data points, auto-matching interval setting.
    - **Outputs:** Various charts (Boiler Temperature, Temperature Difference, Statistics, Outdoor Temperature, etc.) are displayed.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. User selects a date range and adjusts the number of data points.
    2. The component sends a request to retrieve the data for the selected range and number of points.
    3.  The data is formatted and used to configure Highcharts options.
    4.  Highcharts renders the charts based on the provided options.
    5. Charts are dynamically updated when the input parameters are changed.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Data Source:**  The component likely interacts with a backend API to retrieve chart data.
    - **Highcharts:** The component leverages the Highcharts JavaScript library for chart rendering.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - **No Data Available:** The component should handle cases where no data is available for the selected date range.  This could be handled by displaying a "No data" message or an empty chart.
    - **Invalid Date Range:**  The component should validate the selected date range (e.g., start date must be before end date) and display an error message if invalid.
    - **Large Date Range:**  The component should handle large date ranges gracefully, possibly by limiting the number of data points or implementing server-side pagination.
    - **API Errors:** Handle potential errors when fetching data from the backend API (e.g. network errors, server errors). Display error messages to the user.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - Charts should render within a reasonable time (e.g., under 5 seconds).
    - Data fetching should be optimized to minimize network latency.
- **Scalability:**
    - The component should be able to handle a large number of data points without significant performance degradation.
    - Consider server-side pagination to improve scalability.
- **Security:**
    - Ensure data is transmitted securely (e.g., using HTTPS).
    - Validate user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Maintainability:**
    - The component should be well-structured and documented for easy maintenance and modification.
    - Use clear and concise variable names.
- **Reliability & Availability:**
    - The component should be robust and handle unexpected errors gracefully.
    - Implement error handling and logging to aid in debugging.
- **Usability:**
    -  The charts should be visually appealing and easy to understand.
    - The date picker and other input elements should be intuitive and user-friendly.

### 5. Key Components

- **`myForm`:** A form group that handles input fields for date selection and number of data points.
- **`customFromDate`, `customToDate`:**  Date pickers used for selecting the start and end dates.
- **`Highcharts`:**  JavaScript library for rendering charts.
- **`chartOptionsBoilerAverageTemp`, `chartOptionsBoilerDeltaTemp`, ...:** Configuration objects for different charts, specifying data series, labels, colors, and other visual properties.
- **`chartUpdateFlag`, `chartUpdateFlagBoilerStatsByHour`, ...:** Flags used to trigger chart updates.
- **`loading`, `loadingBoilerByHour`, ...:** Flags used to indicate whether data is being loaded.
- **`myReload()`:**  A function that triggers data reloading and chart updates.
- **`operationsChartCallback()`:** Callback function used with the operation chart.

### 6. Dependencies

#### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **HTML:** For rendering the component's structure and UI elements.
- **TypeScript:** For component logic and data handling.
- **Angular Forms:** Used for handling form input and validation.

#### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular:**  Provides the framework for building the component.
- **Material Design (Angular Material):** Provides UI components such as date pickers, buttons, cards, and spinners.
- **Highcharts:** JavaScript charting library.

#### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- Likely dependencies on services for data fetching and API interaction.  (Details would require access to the associated TypeScript code).

### 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:**
    - Implement caching of chart data to reduce the number of API calls.
    - Optimize data fetching by requesting only the necessary data.
    - Consider using web workers to perform data processing in the background.
- **Code Readability:**
    - Refactor large functions into smaller, more manageable units.
    - Add more comments to explain complex logic.
- **Security Improvements:**
    - Implement server-side validation of user input to prevent malicious data from being processed.
    - Ensure that all data transmitted over the network is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Implement server-side pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
    - Consider using a message queue to distribute data processing tasks across multiple servers.
    - Use lazy loading for charts that are not immediately visible to the user.
