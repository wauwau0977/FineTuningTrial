Given the simple definition of `ThException`, effective logging is crucial. Simply catching and logging the message may not be enough to diagnose issues. I'd implement the following considerations:

1. **Log the Exception Stack Trace:** Always log the stack trace of the `ThException` *itself*. This immediately provides context about where the exception originated within the application code.

2. **Log the Root Cause (if any):** As discussed, `ThException` can wrap another exception.  When logging a `ThException`, *always* check if it has a cause using `getCause()`. If a cause exists, log its message and, crucially, its stack trace as well. This ensures the original error isn't masked.

3. **Include Contextual Information:**  Beyond the exception details, log contextual information relevant to the operation that failed. For 'Warmduscher', this might include sensor ID, timestamp, current temperature reading (if available), and any relevant configuration parameters.

4. **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging framework (e.g., Logback, Log4j2, SLF4J) and log to a format that is easily parsed (e.g., JSON). This facilitates efficient querying and analysis of logs.

5. **Correlation ID:** Implement a correlation ID that's passed through all layers of the application. Include this ID in log entries to track a single request or operation across multiple services and components.
