The `ofWebService` static method serves as a factory method responsible for creating a `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` instance from data received, presumably from a web service. It takes a single argument, `data`, which represents the data received from the web service.

The method first checks if the input `data` is null. If it is, it gracefully handles this by returning an `emptyInstance()` of the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`, preventing potential errors.

If the `data` is not null, the method proceeds to create a new `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` instance. It extracts the relevant properties from the `data` object and uses them to initialize the instance's properties. Crucially, the `measurementDateStart` and `measurementDateEnd` properties are initialized using `HeatingDataService.convertDate(data.measurementDateStart)` and `HeatingDataService.convertDate(data.measurementDateEnd)`. This indicates that the dates received from the web service may be in a format that needs to be converted to the Date format expected by the class. The `HeatingDataService.convertDate` method is therefore responsible for parsing or transforming the date strings (or other date representations) received from the web service into `Date` objects suitable for use within the class. The remaining properties—`soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`, `compressorState`, and `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`—are directly assigned from the `data` object.

In essence, the method adapts the format of data received from the web service to the format expected by the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` class, ensuring data consistency and proper initialization of the class instance.
