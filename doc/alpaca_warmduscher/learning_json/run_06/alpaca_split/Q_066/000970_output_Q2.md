This interface-based design provides significant benefits related to testability, maintainability, and dependency injection. Using an interface decouples the consuming code from any specific implementation of the data structure.

**Testability:** Because we interact with the interface `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats`, we can easily mock or stub this dependency during unit testing.  Instead of needing a fully functional implementation (which might rely on a database or other external system), we can create a mock object that returns controlled, predictable values for the getter methods.  This isolates the code under test and allows for focused, reliable tests.

**Maintainability:** Changes to the underlying data source or the way this data is calculated won't require changes to any code that *uses* the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface.  We can provide a different implementation without affecting dependent components, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. This simplifies updates and reduces the risk of introducing regressions.

**Dependency Injection:** This design lends itself naturally to dependency injection. We can pass in an implementation of `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` (perhaps from a data access layer, or even a simple in-memory implementation for testing) via a constructor, setter, or field injection. This promotes loose coupling and allows for flexible configuration.  Using a dependency injection framework (like Spring) would further streamline this process.

Compared to a concrete class, this approach forces us to define a contract (the interface) which helps in defining clear boundaries and responsibilities. While a concrete class might be simpler initially, it quickly becomes harder to manage and test as the application grows.
