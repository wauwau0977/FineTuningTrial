The `<router-outlet>` tag is a directive in Angular that acts as a placeholder where the router will display the component associated with the current route.  Essentially, it's where the dynamically loaded content appears. Angular's routing module listens for route changes (e.g., when a user clicks a link) and then renders the appropriate component *inside* this `<router-outlet>`.  The `class="myContent"` is simply applying a CSS class for styling purposes â€“ it doesn't affect the routing logic itself, but controls the visual presentation of the content loaded within the outlet.
