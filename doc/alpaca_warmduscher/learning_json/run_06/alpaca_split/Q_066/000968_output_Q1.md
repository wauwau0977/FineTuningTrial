Several data quality issues could arise:

*   **Missing Data:** Sensors might fail, or data transmission could be interrupted, leading to missing values for some of the properties. Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and logging. Use default values or imputation techniques (e.g., using the average of neighboring values) for missing data, but document these substitutions.
*   **Outliers:** Faulty sensors or unusual environmental conditions could produce outlier values. Mitigation: Implement outlier detection algorithms (e.g., using statistical methods like standard deviation or interquartile range) and flag or remove these values.  Establish reasonable ranges for each property and reject values outside those ranges.
*   **Incorrect Timestamps:** Inaccurate system clocks or synchronization issues could lead to incorrect timestamps. Mitigation: Ensure all sensors and data storage systems are synchronized using a reliable time source (e.g., NTP). Validate timestamps for plausibility.
*   **Data Type Errors:** Incorrect data types (e.g., a string instead of a number) could cause processing errors. Mitigation: Implement strict data validation at the point of data ingestion.
*   **Inconsistent Units:** If data is collected from multiple sensors, ensure all sensors use consistent units for the same properties. Mitigation: Convert all values to a standard unit during data ingestion.
*   **Data Drift:** Changes in sensor calibration or environmental conditions over time could lead to data drift. Mitigation: Regularly recalibrate sensors and monitor data distributions for shifts.

To mitigate these issues generally, a comprehensive data quality pipeline is necessary, including validation, cleansing, and transformation steps. Logging and monitoring of data quality metrics are crucial for identifying and addressing problems proactively.
