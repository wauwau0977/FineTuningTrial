The `routerLink` attribute is an Angular directive that allows you to navigate to a specific route within your application. In this case, `routerLink="/dashboard"` tells the button to navigate the user to the route associated with the path `/dashboard` when clicked.

The `routerLinkActive` attribute is another Angular directive that adds CSS classes to the button when the current route matches the route specified in `routerLink`. In this example, `routerLinkActive="active-link"` means that when the user is currently on the `/dashboard` route, the button will have the CSS class `active-link` applied to it.

Together, they create a visual indication of the currently active route. You would typically define CSS styles for the `active-link` class (e.g., different background color, bolder font) to highlight the active button in the footer, providing a clear indication to the user which section of the application they are currently viewing.
