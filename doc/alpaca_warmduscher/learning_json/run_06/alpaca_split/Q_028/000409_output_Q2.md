The `minRange: 20` setting within the `yAxis` configuration of `chartOptionsOutdoorTemperature` ensures that the y-axis will always span at least 20 units, even if the data's range is smaller.  

This is designed to address a problem where a chart with a very small data range can appear flattened or visually uninformative. Without `minRange`, if the outdoor temperatures only vary by, say, 2 degrees Celsius, the chart's y-axis would scale to that narrow range, making it difficult to discern any differences. By setting `minRange: 20`, the y-axis will always display a range of 20 degrees, regardless of the actual dataâ€™s minimum and maximum values.  This provides a consistent and more interpretable visual scale, even with limited temperature variation, preventing the chart from appearing compressed or insignificant.  The actual data will be plotted within this minimum range of 20, effectively zooming into the data.
