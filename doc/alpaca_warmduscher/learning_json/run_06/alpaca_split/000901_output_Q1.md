When using collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`, the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are crucial for determining object equality and ensuring the correct behavior of the collection. 

*   `equals()` defines *logical* equality. It determines if two objects are considered equal based on their content. In this case, two `SessionDevice` objects are considered equal if their `sessionId` values are the same.
*   `hashCode()` generates an integer value representing the object. This hash code is used by the collection to quickly locate the object.

The relationship is this: **If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, their `hashCode()` methods *must* return the same value.**  If this contract is violated, the collection will not function correctly. For example, you might add an object to a `HashSet`, and then be unable to find it later, or you might have duplicate objects in the set.

In this specific `SessionDevice` class, the `hashCode()` method is implemented based solely on the `sessionId`. This is consistent with the `equals()` method, which also only compares `sessionId` values. This is a good practice: if you use multiple fields in `equals()`, you *must* also include those same fields in `hashCode()`.
