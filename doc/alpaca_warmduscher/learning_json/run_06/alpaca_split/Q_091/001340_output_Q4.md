The `afterCompletion` method is an implementation of the `HandlerInterceptor` interface's `afterCompletion` method. It's executed after the request has been processed by the handler (controller) and the response has been rendered. Its primary purpose is to gather request information, create a `SessionRequest` object, and persist it to the database if the request is deemed "relevant" based on the `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)` check.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Time Measurement:** It retrieves the `startTime` from the request attributes (set in the `preHandle` method) and calculates the total execution time and processing time.

2. **Data Extraction:** It extracts the following information from the request and response:
   - `path`: The servlet path of the request.
   - `clientId`: The client ID from the `TH-KEY-CLIENT-ID` header.
   - `clientVersion`: The client version from the `TH-KEY-CLIENT-VERSION` header.
   - `ip`: The client's IP address using `Utils.getRequestIP(request)`.
   - `sessionId`: The session ID from the `TH_SERVER_SESSSION_ID` cookie.  If the cookie is not present, the session ID is set to "unknown".
   - `httpStatus`: The HTTP status code from the response.
   - `exception`: The exception message if an exception occurred during request processing; otherwise, it's null.

3. **`SessionRequest` Creation:** A `SessionRequest` object is created and populated with the extracted information.

4. **Conditional Persistence:** The `SessionRequest` object is only persisted to the database if `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)` returns `true`.  This method (defined elsewhere) presumably determines whether the request is of a type that should be logged.

5. **Logging:**
   - If the request is persisted, an informational log message is printed including the total time taken and the `SessionRequest` object itself.
   - If the request is *not* persisted, a different informational log message is printed indicating that the request was received but not persisted, along with the URL.

In essence, this method is responsible for capturing request-level data for monitoring, analytics, or debugging purposes. The conditional persistence and logging ensure that only relevant requests are saved and tracked, potentially reducing database load and log volume.
