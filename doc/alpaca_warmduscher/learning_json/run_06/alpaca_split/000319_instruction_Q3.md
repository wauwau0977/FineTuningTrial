For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
 beforeEach(async () => {
   await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
     declarations: [ AboutComponent ]
   })
   .compileComponents();
 });
```

Explain what the `beforeEach(async () => { ... })` block does, specifically focusing on the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` and `.compileComponents()` methods. Why is the `async` keyword important here?
