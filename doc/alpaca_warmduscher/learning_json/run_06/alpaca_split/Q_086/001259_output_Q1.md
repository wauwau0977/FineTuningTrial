The `SpringApplication` parameter provides access to the Spring Boot application instance, allowing interaction with the application's configuration and environment.  The `String[] args` parameter represents the command-line arguments passed to the application. While not used in this specific implementation, they are available for potential use. For instance, the listener could parse the arguments and configure the `StartupData` bean based on them, or perform some initial setup based on the arguments. The parameters are part of the `SpringApplicationRunListener` contract, and the framework provides them even if the listener doesnâ€™t explicitly use them.  Their presence allows for greater flexibility in future implementations.
