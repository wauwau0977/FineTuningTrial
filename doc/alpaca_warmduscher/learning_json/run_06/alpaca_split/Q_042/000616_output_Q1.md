The use of a dedicated configuration file like `environment.prod.ts` stems from the principle of separating configuration from code. This is a crucial design consideration for several reasons:

*   **Environment-Specific Settings:** It allows the application to behave differently based on the environment (e.g., development, staging, production) without requiring code changes.
*   **Maintainability:** Modifying configuration values doesn't necessitate rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.
*   **Security:** Sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) can be stored separately and securely managed.

**Advantages (Maintainability & Scalability):**

*   **Simplified Deployment:** Different configuration files can be used for different environments, streamlining the deployment process.
*   **Reduced Risk of Errors:** Changes to configuration values are less likely to introduce bugs than changes to code.
*   **Easier Testing:** Mock configurations can be used for testing purposes.
*   **Scalability:** Enables easier scaling as environments are separated and managed.
*   **Collaboration:**  Configuration changes can be handled separately by operations/DevOps teams.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Increased Complexity:**  Introduces an extra layer of complexity in the build and deployment process.
*   **Potential for Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect configuration values can lead to application errors.
*   **Build Step Required:** A build step is usually needed to replace environment variables or swap configuration files.
