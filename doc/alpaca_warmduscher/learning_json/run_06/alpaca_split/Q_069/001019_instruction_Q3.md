For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
private Double temperature;
private Double temperatureMin;
private Double temperatureMax;
private Date temperatureMeasureDate;
```
Considering these fields, what type of data is being stored about temperature, and why might it be useful to store not only the current temperature but also minimum, maximum, and the date of the current measurement?
