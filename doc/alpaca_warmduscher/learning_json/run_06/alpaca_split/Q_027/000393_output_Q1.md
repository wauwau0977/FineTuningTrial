Using a fixed-interval timer like `interval(1000 * 180)` to reload data has several potential implications:

*   **Unnecessary Reloads:** The data is reloaded every 3 minutes, regardless of whether the underlying data has changed. This can waste resources and impact performance.
*   **Potential for Conflicts:** If the data loading takes longer than 3 minutes, multiple requests could be initiated simultaneously, leading to conflicts or errors.
*   **Lack of Responsiveness:** The UI will not reflect data changes until the timer interval elapses, leading to a delay in updating the information.

Here are some alternatives:

1.  **Event-Driven Approach:** Instead of a timer, listen for events that indicate data changes on the server (e.g., using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events). This ensures that the UI is updated only when necessary.
2.  **Polling with Backoff:** Implement a polling mechanism that checks for updates at regular intervals, but with a backoff strategy. If the server returns a "no changes" response, increase the polling interval to reduce unnecessary requests.
3.  **Cache Invalidation:** Utilize a caching mechanism on the server and invalidate the cache when the data changes. The client can then request the latest data whenever needed.
4.  **Combine with User Interaction:** Trigger a reload only when the user interacts with the chart or a specific component, allowing for on-demand updates.
