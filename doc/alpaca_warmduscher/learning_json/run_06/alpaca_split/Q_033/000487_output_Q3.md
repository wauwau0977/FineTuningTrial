The `static` keyword indicates that the `emptyInstance()` method belongs to the `HeatingEntity` class itself, rather than to instances of the class. This means you can call `HeatingEntity.emptyInstance()` directly on the class, without needing to create an instance of `HeatingEntity` first.

The method is intended to return a default, empty instance of the `HeatingEntity` class, populated with default or null values for all its properties. This is useful in situations where you need a placeholder `HeatingEntity` object, or as a starting point for creating a new instance with data. It's a convenient way to ensure that you always have a valid object to work with, even if no data is available yet.
