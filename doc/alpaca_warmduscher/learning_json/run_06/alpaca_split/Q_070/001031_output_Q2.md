This constructor exemplifies the **Dependency Injection (DI)** design principle. Instead of the `HeatingDataPoller` creating its own instances of `HeatingDataReadService` and `HeatPumpRepository`, these dependencies are *injected* into the class via the constructor.

DI is crucial for unit testing because it allows you to easily **decouple** the class under test from its dependencies. This means you can:

1.  **Mock or Stub Dependencies:** You can replace the real `HeatingDataReadService` and `HeatPumpRepository` with mock objects during testing. These mocks allow you to control the behavior of the dependencies and isolate the logic of the `HeatingDataPoller`. For example, you can configure a mock `HeatingDataReadService` to return specific test data or simulate error conditions.

2.  **Isolate Unit Tests:**  By mocking dependencies, you can focus your tests solely on the `HeatingDataPoller`'s logic without being affected by the complexities or failures of its dependencies. This makes your tests more reliable, faster, and easier to understand.

3.  **Test Different Scenarios:** You can easily test different scenarios by injecting different mock dependencies. For example, you can inject a mock `HeatPumpRepository` that simulates a database connection error to verify that the `HeatingDataPoller` handles such errors gracefully.

Without DI, you would be forced to create and configure the dependencies within the `HeatingDataPoller` during testing, which would make your tests more complex, brittle, and tightly coupled to the implementation details of the dependencies.
