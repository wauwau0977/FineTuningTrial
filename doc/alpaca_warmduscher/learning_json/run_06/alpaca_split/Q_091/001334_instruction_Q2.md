For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java' with name 'MyRequestInterceptor.java'... 
The code uses `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)` to determine whether to save the request details.  If `MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request)` returns `false`, the code logs "Did receive a request which was not persisted. url=" + path". What is the primary design consideration behind this conditional logging and why is it important?
