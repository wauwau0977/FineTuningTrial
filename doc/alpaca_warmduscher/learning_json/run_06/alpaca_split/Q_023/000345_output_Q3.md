The `[class.myLoading]="loading"` binding dynamically applies the CSS class `myLoading` to the `<highcharts-chart>` element when the value of the `loading` component variable is truthy.  This means that if the `loading` variable is set to `true`, the `myLoading` class is added to the `highcharts-chart` element, and when `loading` is `false`, the `myLoading` class is removed.

This binding is used in conjunction with the `<mat-spinner>` element. The `<mat-spinner>` is conditionally rendered using the `*ngIf="loading"` structural directive. This means the `<mat-spinner>` is only displayed when the `loading` variable is `true`. 

The intended effect is to provide visual feedback to the user that data is being loaded or processed. When `loading` is `true`, both the `myLoading` class is applied to the chart (presumably adding some visual indication within the chart itself, like a placeholder or overlay), and the `<mat-spinner>` is displayed, creating a combined loading indicator. When `loading` is `false`, the `<mat-spinner>` disappears and the `myLoading` class is removed, indicating that the data is loaded and the chart is ready.  This creates a better user experience by keeping the user informed about the application's state.
