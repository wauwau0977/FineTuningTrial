This implementation, while seemingly straightforward, has several potential edge cases and boundary conditions that need to be addressed:

1. **Temperature of Absolute Zero (0 Kelvin):**  The formula includes `(temperature + 273.15)` in the denominator. If `temperature` is -273.15 (absolute zero), this will result in division by zero, causing an exception.  A test case should specifically verify that this scenario is handled gracefully (either by throwing an exception or returning a sensible default value).

2. **Negative Temperature:** While temperatures below 0Â°C are possible, the original formula may not be accurate or meaningful for such values. A test case should verify the output for negative temperatures to determine whether it needs adjustments or error handling.

3. **Humidity of 0%:**  If humidity is 0, the calculated absolute humidity should also be 0. A test case should confirm this.

4. **Humidity of 100%:** If humidity is 100%, the formula is valid, but it might be worth testing a value very close to 100% to ensure that there aren't any rounding issues that could lead to unexpected results.

5. **Extremely High or Low Temperatures:** Very high or low temperatures (outside the typical range for atmospheric conditions) might cause the formula to produce unrealistic or inaccurate results.  Testing with extreme values can help identify these issues.

6. **Large Numbers:** Inputting extremely large numbers (although unlikely in a real-world scenario) could cause overflow issues.

Here are some test cases to cover these scenarios:

*   **Temperature = -273.15, Humidity = 50:** Should throw an exception or handle the division by zero appropriately.
*   **Temperature = -10, Humidity = 50:** Verify the result for a negative temperature.
*   **Temperature = 20, Humidity = 0:**  Assert that the result is 0.
*   **Temperature = 20, Humidity = 100:** Assert the value is correct
*   **Temperature = 50, Humidity = 50:** Test with a high temperature.
*   **Temperature = 20, Humidity = 101:** Check for inputs outside the range of 0-100
*   **Temperature = -274, Humidity = 50:** Additional edge case.
*   **Temperature = Double.MAX_VALUE, Humidity = 50:** Testing with extremely large input values.
