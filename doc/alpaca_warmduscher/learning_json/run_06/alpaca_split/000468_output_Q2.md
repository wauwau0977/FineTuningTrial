The `public` keyword in the constructor's parameter list is a convenient shorthand in TypeScript. It automatically declares and assigns the constructor parameters as public instance variables of the class.  In essence, it combines declaration and initialization in one step, reducing boilerplate code. Without `public`, you'd need to declare each variable as a private or protected member of the class and then assign the constructor parameter to it.

The benefit is cleaner, more concise code. It makes the constructor easier to read and maintain.

However, there are potential drawbacks:

1. **Reduced Flexibility:** It tightly couples the constructor parameters to the class's public API. If you later need to change the internal representation of a property without changing its public interface, you're limited. This can make refactoring more difficult.

2. **Increased Coupling:**  It increases the coupling between the constructor and the public API.  Any change to the constructor parameters inherently affects the public interface.

3. **Testability Concerns:**  While not a major issue, it can slightly complicate unit testing if you need to mock or intercept the creation of instances. You're directly creating public properties, rather than having more control over initialization through private/protected setters.

4. **Potential for Accidental Exposure:** It's easier to accidentally expose properties that were intended to be private or protected.  A simple typo or oversight can result in a property being publicly accessible.

In general, while convenient for simple classes, I'd recommend carefully considering whether the benefits of using `public` outweigh the potential drawbacks, especially for more complex classes or those that are likely to undergo significant refactoring in the future. Using private or protected members and providing controlled access through getters and setters can offer greater flexibility and maintainability.
