The immediate re-throwing of the exception as a `RuntimeException` within `pollData()` is problematic. While it ensures the error isn't silently swallowed, it lacks nuance and can lead to application crashes.  If `heatingDataReadService.getData()` fails (e.g., due to a temporary network issue or Modbus communication error), the entire application (or a significant portion) could terminate, as the `RuntimeException` will bubble up unless caught higher up the call stack. This removes any opportunity for graceful error handling or retries.

A better approach would be:

1. **Specific Exception Handling:** Catch more specific exceptions within the `try-catch` block.  Instead of `Throwable`, catch `IOException`, `ModbusException` (assuming such a class exists), or other expected exception types. This allows for different handling strategies based on the error.
2. **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors.  For example, if an `IOException` occurs, log the error, wait a short period, and retry the `heatingDataReadService.getData()` call a few times. Use a backoff strategy (increase the wait time between retries) to avoid overwhelming the external service.
3. **Error Reporting & Logging:** Log the error with sufficient detail, including the exception message, stack trace, and any relevant context.  Consider using an error reporting service to track and monitor errors.
4. **Fallback Value/Default State:** In some cases, it might be appropriate to use a fallback value or set the system to a safe default state if data retrieval consistently fails. This prevents the application from crashing and ensures it remains functional, even with limited data.
5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern. If the `heatingDataReadService.getData()` fails repeatedly within a certain timeframe, the circuit breaker will trip, preventing further calls to the service and potentially returning a cached value or a default state. This protects the application from being overwhelmed by a failing external service.

For example:

```java
@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}", initialDelay = 0)
public void pollData() {
    long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    HeatPumpEntity heatPumpEntity;
    int retries = 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
        try {
            heatPumpEntity = heatingDataReadService.getData();
            break; // Exit loop if successful
        } catch (IOException e) {
            log.warn("IO Exception while reading data (attempt {}/{}), retrying...", i + 1, retries, e);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000 * (i + 1)); // Backoff strategy
            } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                log.error("Interrupted during retry", ie);
                throw new RuntimeException("Interrupted during retry", ie);
            }
        } catch (Throwable e) { // Catch other exceptions
            log.error("Exception while reading data from ModBus or MockService.", e);
            throw new RuntimeException("Exception while reading data", e); //Still throw, but after logging
        }
    }
    heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity);
    log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0));
}
```
