You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

The `AboutComponent` is an Angular component that displays build timestamp information for both the client and server sides of the Warmduscher application. It fetches the server build timestamp from a `HeatingDataService` and displays it alongside the client build timestamp, which is sourced from the `environment` file. This component aims to provide versioning and debugging information within the application's "About" section.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `AboutComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Display client and server build timestamps. Fetch the server build timestamp via a service call.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: No direct user inputs.  Outputs are the displayed client and server build timestamps on the "About" page.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. On initialization (`ngOnInit`), the component fetches the server build timestamp using the `HeatingDataService`.
    2. The component then displays both the client build timestamp (from `environment`) and the fetched server build timestamp.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Makes an HTTP request to retrieve server information via the `HeatingDataService`.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If the `HeatingDataService` call fails or returns no data, `buildTimestampServer` will remain empty and be displayed as such.
    - Type safety is bypassed with `@ts-ignore`. This is potentially problematic if the service response structure changes.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The component should load quickly and not introduce noticeable delays in displaying the "About" information.  The `HeatingDataService` call should be reasonably fast.
- **Scalability**: The component itself does not directly impact scalability.  Scalability depends on the `HeatingDataService` and the server it interacts with.
- **Security**:  No direct security concerns within the component itself. The security of the fetched server information depends on the `HeatingDataService` implementation and server-side security.
- **Maintainability**: The component is relatively small and straightforward. Good variable naming and code commenting would improve maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The component's reliability depends on the `HeatingDataService` and the server's availability.
- **Usability**: The "About" information provides useful debugging and versioning information to users or administrators.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are apparent.

## 5. Key Components

- **`AboutComponent`**: The main component that orchestrates the display of build timestamps.
- **`ngOnInit()`**: Lifecycle hook that triggers the server timestamp retrieval.
- **`getBuildTimestampServer()`**: Retrieves the server build timestamp from the `HeatingDataService`. It uses a subscription to the observable returned by the service.
- **`buildTimestampClient`**: Stores the client build timestamp from the `environment` file.
- **`buildTimestampServer`**: Stores the server build timestamp fetched from the service.
- **Error Handling**: Limited.  Empty string displayed if service call fails.
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: Part of the Angular application module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript syntax.
- Angular component lifecycle hooks.
- Observable/Subscription pattern for asynchronous data retrieval.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular:**  Used for building the UI component.
- **RxJS:** Used for handling asynchronous operations with Observables.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`**:  Provides access to server information, including the build timestamp.
- **`environment`**:  Provides configuration variables, including the client build timestamp.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: Consider caching the server build timestamp to reduce the number of service calls.
- **Code Readability**: Add more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each variable and function.
- **Security Improvements**:  Evaluate if the server build timestamp is sensitive data and if any security measures are needed to protect it.
- **Scalability Considerations**: The component itself doesn't directly affect scalability but relies on the `HeatingDataService`'s scalability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling. Display an error message to the user if the `HeatingDataService` call fails instead of just showing an empty string.
- **Remove `@ts-ignore`**: Investigate the type mismatch and correct the code to remove the need for `@ts-ignore`. This will improve type safety and prevent potential runtime errors. Consider defining a proper interface for the expected response from `HeatingDataService`.
