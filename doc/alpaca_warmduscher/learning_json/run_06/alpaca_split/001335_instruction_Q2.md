For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java' with name 'MyRequestInterceptor.java'... 
Consider the following code snippet:

```java
String clientId = request.getHeader(TH_KEY_CLIENT_ID);
String clientVersion = request.getHeader(CLIENT_VERSION);
```

What potential issues might arise if the `TH_KEY_CLIENT_ID` or `CLIENT_VERSION` headers are missing from the request? How could you improve the robustness of this code to handle these scenarios?
