The `public` keyword before each parameter in the constructor creates instance variables of the `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` class, directly accessible from outside the class. This effectively combines the declaration and initialization of the class properties.  Without `public`, these parameters would be local variables within the constructor, and you'd need separate lines of code to assign them to class properties. The use of `public` offers a concise way to define and initialize the class's state in a single step, promoting readability and reducing boilerplate code. It means that any code using an instance of `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` can directly access and modify these properties (e.g., `instance.dayOfWeekStartingMonday = 1`).
