The `webhook` method is the core of the Dialogflow integration, handling incoming requests from Dialogflow and generating responses. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Request Parsing:** The method receives a raw JSON string `rawData` representing the Dialogflow webhook request. It uses the `jacksonFactory` to create a JSON parser from this string and then parses it into a `GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest` object. The parsed request is then logged for debugging purposes.

2. **Data Processing:** The method retrieves current heating data using `heatPumpDataService.getCurrent()`. Specifically, it extracts the `boilerTemp` from the returned object.  This `boilerTemp` is the core data being used to build the response.

3. **Response Construction:** A `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessage` is created, and a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2IntentMessageText` is nested within it. The `boilerTemp` value is formatted into a string "Boiler Temperatur ist " + [boilerTemp] and added as a single element to a list, which becomes the text content of the message. This list of messages is then assigned to the `fulfillmentMessages` field of a `GoogleCloudDialogflowV2WebhookResponse` object.

4. **Response Serialization:** A `StringWriter` is created to hold the serialized JSON. A `JsonGenerator` is created, linked to the `StringWriter`, and pretty printing is enabled. The `response` object is serialized into the `JsonGenerator`, and the generator is flushed. Finally, the content of the `StringWriter` (which now contains the JSON response) is returned as a string. This string is sent back to Dialogflow as the fulfillment response.
