For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts' with name 'heating-data.service.spec.ts'... 
Assuming the `HeatingDataService` has a method called `getHeatingData()`, which returns an Observable of type `any`, how would you write a unit test to verify that this method is called when a specific component method (e.g., `loadData()`) is triggered?
