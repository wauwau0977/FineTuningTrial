```java
@Component
public class CorsFilter implements Filter {
    // ... rest of the class
}
```

The `@Component` annotation signifies that the `CorsFilter` class is a Spring-managed component.  In the context of the Spring framework, it's a marker for auto-detection of classes that should be registered as beans in the Spring application context.

Here's how it influences the lifecycle and management of the class:

1. **Bean Registration:** Spring's component scanning mechanism (enabled by default in many configurations, or explicitly through `@ComponentScan`) will scan the application for classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`. When `CorsFilter` is found, Spring will create an instance of it (a bean) and register it in the application context.

2. **Dependency Injection:**  If `CorsFilter` had dependencies on other beans, Spring would automatically resolve and inject those dependencies into the `CorsFilter` instance.

3. **Lifecycle Management:** Spring manages the lifecycle of the `CorsFilter` bean.  This means Spring handles the instantiation, initialization (potentially through a constructor or initialization methods), and destruction of the bean.

4. **AOP and other Spring features:** As a Spring-managed bean, `CorsFilter` can participate in other Spring features like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), transaction management, and more.

In summary, `@Component` tells Spring to treat `CorsFilter` as a managed bean, making it eligible for dependency injection, lifecycle management, and participation in other Spring framework features. The alternative is to manually define the bean in a Spring configuration file (XML or Java config), but using `@Component` simplifies the configuration and promotes a more component-based architecture.
