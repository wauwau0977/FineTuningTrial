The use of `Arrays.toString` on the `value` string, which is derived from an HTTP header, introduces a few potential issues:

1.  **Unnecessary String Formatting:** `Arrays.toString` is designed to represent arrays as strings (e.g., "[element1, element2]"). In this context, it adds brackets and commas, which isn't the desired format for representing an IP address or a list of IP addresses. It complicates parsing the IP address if it's used later.
2.  **Handling Multiple IPs:**  The code intends to split the header value by ", " (comma and space). However, the `Arrays.toString` converts the resulting array into a string like "[192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1]".  This makes it difficult to reliably extract individual IP addresses.
3.  **Security Concerns (IP Spoofing):** While not directly related to `Arrays.toString`, relying solely on HTTP headers for IP address identification is inherently vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks. Malicious clients can manipulate these headers to report false IP addresses.

**Alternative Approaches:**

1.  **Directly return the split string as a list:** Instead of `Arrays.toString`, the code should return a `List<String>` created from the `split("\\s*,\\s*")` operation:

    ```java
    String[] ips = value.split("\\s*,\\s*");
    return String.join(",", ips); //or return Arrays.asList(ips);
    ```
2.  **IP Address Validation:** After splitting the header value, validate each potential IP address using a regular expression or a dedicated IP address validation library to ensure it's a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. This helps mitigate the risk of accepting spoofed or invalid data.
3.  **Consider X-Forwarded-For Header carefully:** When using `X-Forwarded-For`, be aware that it can contain a chain of IP addresses (proxy IPs and the original client IP). You might want to extract only the first IP address in the chain (the original client IP) or handle the entire chain appropriately based on your application's requirements.
4.  **Use `request.getRemoteAddr()` as a Last Resort:** If no reliable IP address can be extracted from the headers, fall back to `request.getRemoteAddr()`. However, be aware that this will only provide the IP address of the immediate proxy server or the client if there's no proxy.
5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to filter out malicious requests and prevent IP spoofing attacks.
