The `FilterChain` is a core component of the Servlet Filter mechanism in Java. It represents a chain of filters that can intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the target Servlet or resource.  Each filter in the chain has the opportunity to examine and potentially modify the request and/or response.

`chain.doFilter(request, response)` is crucial because it's the mechanism by which the filter chain is progressed.  When a filter calls `chain.doFilter()`, it delegates control to the *next* filter in the chain.  This process continues until the end of the chain is reached. At that point, control is passed to the target Servlet or resource.  

Effectively, `chain.doFilter()` says, "I've done my processing of this request/response, now let the next filter (or the target resource) handle it." If `chain.doFilter()` isn't called, the request will be halted at that filter, and the target resource won't be reached, potentially causing a timeout or error.
