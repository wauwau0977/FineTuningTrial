The benefit of including `console.log` statements in unit tests is primarily for debugging purposes. They allow developers to inspect the value of variables at specific points during test execution, helping to understand why a test might be failing or behaving unexpectedly. This is especially useful when the logic is complex or the source of the problem isn’t immediately obvious.

However, there are drawbacks. `console.log` statements add noise to the test output, making it harder to identify actual failures. They can also slow down test execution, especially if there are many of them. Most importantly, tests should be deterministic and reliable, and relying on `console.log` for understanding the test behavior isn’t ideal. Good tests should have clear assertions that indicate success or failure without requiring manual inspection of logs. Therefore, while helpful during development, `console.log` statements should typically be removed or commented out before committing test code.
