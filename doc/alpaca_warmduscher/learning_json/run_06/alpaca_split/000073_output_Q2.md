While `require.context` is a common approach in older Angular projects, it has several limitations compared to more modern test discovery methods offered by tools like Jest or Karma's glob-based file lists.

*   **Static at Build Time:** `require.context` resolves the list of test files at *build time*. This means that if you add a new test file, you need to rebuild your application for the test runner to recognize it. Modern tools like Jest and Karma can dynamically scan for test files at runtime, so you don't need to rebuild.
*   **Limited Configuration:** It lacks the fine-grained configuration options available in other tools.  For example, you can't easily specify complex include/exclude patterns or filter tests based on tags or categories using `require.context`.
*   **Webpack Dependency:**  `require.context` relies heavily on Webpackâ€™s module resolution. This can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if you're not using Webpack or if your Webpack configuration is complex.
*   **Difficult to Mock:** Mocking or stubbing dependencies can be more challenging with `require.context` because the test files are loaded dynamically.
*   **Performance:**  For large projects, the initial load of all tests using `require.context` can be slower than more optimized approaches that load tests on demand or in parallel.
* **Test Isolation**: It's harder to achieve true test isolation. All tests are loaded at once which makes it possible for tests to interfere with each other.

Tools like Jest and Karma's glob patterns offer several advantages:

*   **Dynamic Discovery**: Tests are discovered at runtime, eliminating the need for rebuilds.
*   **Glob Patterns**:  Support for powerful glob patterns for including/excluding files.
*   **Configuration Options**:  Extensive configuration options for customizing the test discovery process.
*   **Caching**:  Caching mechanisms to improve performance.
*   **Test Runners**: Provide built-in test runners with features like test filtering, coverage reporting, and mocking.
