You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines an Angular HTTP interceptor (`MyHttpInterceptor`) that adds client identification and version information to every outgoing HTTP request. This is likely used for tracking, analytics, or compatibility purposes on the server-side. The interceptor retrieves the client ID from a dedicated service (`ClientIdService`) and uses the application's build timestamp as the client version.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `MyHttpInterceptor`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** The primary operation is to intercept all outgoing HTTP requests and add headers containing the client ID and client version before sending the request to the server.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Input:** An `HttpRequest` object representing the outgoing HTTP request.
    - **Output:** An `Observable<HttpEvent<any>>` representing the modified HTTP request and the response from the server.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `intercept` method is called for every outgoing HTTP request.
    2. It retrieves the client ID from the `ClientIdService`.
    3. It retrieves the client version from the `environment` configuration file (specifically, `environment.buildTimestampClient`).
    4. It clones the original request.
    5. It adds/updates the `ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID` and `ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION` headers in the cloned request.
    6. It passes the modified request to the next handler in the chain using `next.handle()`.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Interacts with `ClientIdService` to retrieve the client ID.
    - Reads the `environment.buildTimestampClient` value from the `environment` configuration file.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - If `ClientIdService` fails to retrieve a client ID, it currently defaults to no client ID being added (as the code does not include explicit error handling or fallback logic).
    - If `environment.buildTimestampClient` is undefined, no client version is added.
    - The interceptor handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The interceptor should add minimal overhead to the request processing time.  The header addition process is lightweight, but excessive processing within the `intercept` method could become a bottleneck.
- **Scalability:** The interceptor does not directly impact scalability. However, the service used to retrieve the client ID (`ClientIdService`) and the storage of client IDs could impact scalability.
- **Security:** While not directly implementing security measures, the addition of client IDs could be used for tracking or auditing purposes, which may have security implications if not handled correctly on the server-side.
- **Maintainability:** The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The interceptor's reliability depends on the reliability of the `ClientIdService` and the application environment.
- **Usability:** Easily integrated into an Angular application by registering the interceptor in the `app.module.ts`.
- **Compliance:** N/A (unless specific client tracking regulations apply).

## 5. Key Components

- **`MyHttpInterceptor` Class:** The main class that implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface.
- **`intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>>` Function:**  This function intercepts HTTP requests and adds the client ID and version headers.
- **Error Handling:** Minimal error handling. The code doesn't explicitly handle scenarios where `ClientIdService` fails to retrieve a client ID.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:** Part of the Angular application module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript:**  Used for type safety and code organization.
- **RxJS (Observable):**  Used for handling asynchronous HTTP requests.
- **Angular HTTP Interceptor Interface:** Used to intercept HTTP requests.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **@angular/common/http:** Provides the HTTP client and interceptor interfaces.
- **@angular/core:** Provides dependency injection and core Angular functionalities.
- **RxJS:** Provides Observable types for handling asynchronous operations.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`./client-id.service.ts` (ClientIdService):**  Provides the client ID.
- **`../environments/environment.ts`:** Provides the build timestamp for the client version.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling within the `intercept` method. If `ClientIdService` fails to retrieve a client ID, log an error and potentially use a default value or skip adding the header.
- **Configuration:** Consider making the header keys (`ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID`, `ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION`) configurable through environment variables or a configuration file.
- **Logging:** Add logging to track successful header additions and any errors encountered.
- **Performance Monitoring:** If the interceptor is suspected of causing performance issues, add performance monitoring to measure the time taken by the `intercept` method.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests to verify that the interceptor correctly adds the client ID and version headers for different HTTP methods and request types.
- **Client ID Strategy**: Investigate different strategies for generating and storing client IDs, considering privacy and security implications.
