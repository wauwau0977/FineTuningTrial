The `emptyInstance()` static method is a factory method designed to create and return a default, "empty" instance of the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` class. It's intended to provide a safe, initialized object when no real data is available.

The method initializes a new `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` instance with the following default values:

*   `measurementDateStart`: A new `Date()` object representing the current date and time.
*   `measurementDateEnd`: A new `Date()` object representing the current date and time.
*   `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`: 0
*   `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`: 0
*   `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`: 0
*   `compressorState`: `false`
*   `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`: 0

The primary problem this method solves is the need to avoid returning `null` or undefined values when data is missing. Providing an `emptyInstance` allows calling code to reliably work with an initialized object, preventing potential errors such as accessing properties of a null object.  It's often used as a fallback when web service calls fail or return empty data, providing a predictable and safe default state.
