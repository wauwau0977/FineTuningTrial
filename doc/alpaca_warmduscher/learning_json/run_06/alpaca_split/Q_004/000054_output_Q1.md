Having too many global styles in a single file, like `styles.sass`, can lead to several drawbacks:

*   **Specificity Conflicts:** Global styles can easily conflict with styles defined in components, leading to unexpected behavior and difficulty in debugging.
*   **Maintainability Issues:**  A large, monolithic style file becomes difficult to navigate, understand, and maintain.  Finding specific styles becomes time-consuming.
*   **Code Duplication:** Global styles are often duplicated across components, leading to redundancy and increased file size.
*   **Performance Impact:**  Browsers have to parse and apply all the global styles, even if they are not needed for the current page, potentially impacting performance.

Strategies for better organization and management:

*   **Component-Specific Styles:** The preferred approach is to define styles directly within the component that needs them, using techniques like CSS Modules, Styled Components, or scoped styles in frameworks like Angular or Vue.
*   **Modularization:** Break down the global styles into smaller, more manageable files (partials) based on functionality or components. For example: `_variables.sass`, `_typography.sass`, `_buttons.sass`.
*   **Importing Partials:** Import these partials into the main `styles.sass` file using `@import`.
*   **CSS-in-JS:** Consider using CSS-in-JS libraries (like Styled Components or Emotion) which co-locate styles with components, offering encapsulation and dynamic styling.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Establish clear naming conventions to avoid conflicts and improve readability.  BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular methodology.
*   **Utility-First CSS:** Libraries like Tailwind CSS offer pre-defined utility classes which can reduce the need for custom CSS, but introduce a different set of challenges regarding bundle size and learning curve.
