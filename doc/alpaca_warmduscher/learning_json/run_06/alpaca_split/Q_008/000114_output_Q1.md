Using SASS (or a similar CSS preprocessor) for this project offers several benefits compared to plain CSS, but also introduces some complexity.

**Benefits specific to this file:**

*   **Organization:** While not extensively used in this small snippet, SASS allows for better organization of CSS through nesting.  Even here, nesting the `button` styles within `.toolbarNav` improves readability. In a larger project, this becomes significantly more valuable.
*   **Maintainability:** The use of nesting makes the code more maintainable. Changes to styles can be made in a localized manner.
*   **Readability:** Nesting improves the readability of the code.
*   **Variables (Potential):** Although not currently used, SASS allows the use of variables. This makes it easy to manage colors, fonts, and other values across the entire project. It promotes consistency and simplifies updates.

**Drawbacks:**

*   **Compilation Step:** SASS requires a compilation step to convert the SASS code into plain CSS. This adds complexity to the build process.
*   **Learning Curve:** Developers need to learn the SASS syntax and features, which adds a learning curve.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging SASS can be more difficult than debugging plain CSS, as the browser only sees the compiled CSS. Source maps help mitigate this.
*   **Increased Project Complexity:** For very small projects, the overhead of SASS might not be worth it.

**In summary:** For this specific file, the benefits of SASS are modest. However, if the project is likely to grow in complexity, the organizational and maintainability benefits of SASS will become increasingly valuable. The current nesting improves the codeâ€™s structure, and the potential for using variables and mixins would further enhance its maintainability and scalability. If the project were significantly larger, SASS would be highly recommended.
