For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/main.ts' with name 'main.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the role of the `environment` object imported from `./environments/environment`. How does this file and its associated logic contribute to the application's configuration and adaptability?
