To support future analytics without breaking existing code, I’d focus on extensibility and non-breaking changes.  I'd use the following principles:

1. **Add methods, don’t modify existing ones:** Any new analytics requirements should be addressed by adding new getter methods to the interface.  This avoids changing the existing contract and breaking code that relies on the current methods.
2. **Default methods (Java 8+)**: Introduce default methods to provide default implementations for new methods. This allows existing implementing classes to continue functioning without immediate modification.  Later, specific implementations can be provided when needed.
3. **Versioning (if necessary)**: If significant changes are unavoidable, consider a versioning strategy. This could involve creating a new interface (e.g., `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeekV2`) or using a version identifier within the existing interface.
4. **Avoid complex data structures**: Keep the interface lean and focused. Avoid adding complex data structures that might require significant changes in the future.

For example, if we needed to add the average boiler difference, I’d add a `Double getAverageBoilerDiff();` method with a default implementation that returns null or throws an UnsupportedOperationException.  This allows existing code to continue functioning while providing a hook for future enhancements.
