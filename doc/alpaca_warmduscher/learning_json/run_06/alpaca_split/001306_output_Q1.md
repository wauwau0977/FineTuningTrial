Choosing ISO 8601 formats (like `ISO_DATE` and `ISO_DATE_TIME`) has several important implications:

*   **Interoperability:** ISO 8601 is a universally recognized standard. This ensures that data can be easily exchanged with other systems and applications, regardless of their programming language or platform. This is crucial for integrations with external services or systems.
*   **Sorting:** ISO 8601 formats are designed to be lexicographically sortable. This means that strings representing dates and times can be sorted alphabetically as strings, and the resulting order will also be chronologically correct. This simplifies data retrieval and ordering.
*   **Human Readability:** While not as immediately intuitive as some locale-specific formats (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY"), ISO 8601 is reasonably readable, especially for technical users. The consistent structure makes it easier to parse visually.
*   **Unambiguity:** ISO 8601 eliminates ambiguity in date and time representation. It clearly defines the order of year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, avoiding confusion that can occur with different locale-specific formats.
*   **Database Compatibility:** Many databases have native support for ISO 8601 date/time types, simplifying data storage and retrieval.

In summary, ISO 8601 provides a robust, unambiguous, and interoperable way to represent dates and times, making it a good choice for data exchange, storage, and sorting, particularly in distributed systems and applications that need to handle data from multiple sources. While it may require some adaptation for users accustomed to locale-specific formats, the benefits in terms of reliability and compatibility usually outweigh the drawbacks.
