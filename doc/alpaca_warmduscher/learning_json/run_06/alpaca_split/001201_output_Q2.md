The `getMedian` method, as implemented, has potential performance issues when dealing with very large `entries` collections (millions of elements).

**Potential Issues:**

1.  **Memory Consumption:** The code creates a `double[] values` array with a size equal to `samples` (which is either the collection size or a specified limit). For extremely large collections, even if `limit` is used, the `values` array can consume a significant amount of memory.
2.  **Iteration Overhead:** The code iterates through the entire `entries` collection to populate the `values` array, even if only a subset of elements is needed for calculating the median. This iteration can become a performance bottleneck for large datasets. The nested loop and conditional `i < startPos` adds up.
3.  **Array Copying:** While not explicit in the code, creating and populating the `values` array involves copying data from the `entries` collection, which can be time-consuming for large datasets.

**Optimization Strategies:**

1.  **Use a Streaming Approach:** Instead of loading all elements into an array, use a streaming approach to calculate the median. Libraries like Apache Commons Math provide methods for calculating the median using a streaming algorithm, which processes elements one at a time without requiring the entire dataset to be loaded into memory.
2.  **Quickselect Algorithm:** Implement the Quickselect algorithm, which is a selection algorithm that can find the k-th smallest element in an unordered list. This can be used to find the median directly without sorting the entire dataset.  This approach typically has an average time complexity of O(n), making it more efficient than sorting.
3.  **Reservoir Sampling:** If you can't load the entire dataset into memory, use reservoir sampling to select a random sample of elements from the collection. Then, calculate the median of the sample. The accuracy of the estimate will depend on the sample size.
4.  **Parallel Processing:** If the data allows it, parallelize the iteration and data processing.  Split the `entries` collection into smaller chunks and process each chunk in a separate thread.
5.  **Reduce Data Precision:** If appropriate, reduce the precision of the numbers in the `entries` collection (e.g., from double to float) to reduce memory consumption and processing time.

For this specific method, a combination of using a streaming approach with Quickselect, or employing parallel processing with a smaller array size would likely yield the most significant improvements.
