For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpEntity.java'... 
The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are overridden, and the `equals()` method only checks the `id` field. What implications does this have for comparing `HeatPumpEntity` objects, and under what circumstances might this behavior lead to unexpected results or bugs?
