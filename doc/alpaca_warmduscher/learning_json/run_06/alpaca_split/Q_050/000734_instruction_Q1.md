For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataServiceImpl.java' with name 'MeteoDataServiceImpl.java'... 
The `extractFromJSON` method uses `JsonPath` to retrieve data. How does the use of `TypeRef` contribute to the correctness and type safety of data extraction, specifically when handling the 'value' property? Could this be accomplished without using `TypeRef` and what would be the risks?
