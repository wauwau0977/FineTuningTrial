Checking for the absence of specific characters is a fragile approach. It only catches the presence of those *particular* characters, and doesn't guarantee that other invalid or unexpected characters aren't present in the encoded string, or that the decoding process is working correctly. It's possible for the encoding to be corrupted in subtle ways that don't manifest as those specific characters.

Additional validation needed:

1.  **Valid Base58 Character Set:**  Verify that the encoded string contains *only* valid Base58 characters (a-zA-Z0-9). The current `assertTrue(base58.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]+"));` is a good start, but should be applied to *all* encoded strings.
2.  **Round Trip Test:**  The core test is to ensure a round trip: encode a string, and then decode the result.  The decoded string *must* be identical to the original input string.  This is already done with `assertEquals(testString, Base58BitcoinFlavor.decodeBase58ToUnicodeString(base58));`, but should be the primary validation.
3.  **Boundary and Edge Cases:** Test with various boundary and edge cases, such as empty strings, strings with special Unicode characters, very long strings, and strings containing characters near the beginning or end of the Unicode range.
4.  **Error Handling:**  If the encoding or decoding process is expected to throw exceptions for invalid input, ensure that these exceptions are handled correctly and that the tests verify that exceptions are thrown when appropriate.
