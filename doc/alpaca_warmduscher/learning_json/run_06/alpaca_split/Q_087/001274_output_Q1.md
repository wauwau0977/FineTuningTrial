The `@Component` annotation is a Spring framework annotation that marks the class `StartupData` as a Spring-managed component. This signifies that Spring's dependency injection container will automatically detect, instantiate, and manage this class as a bean within the application context. 

The implications are:

1.  **Bean Creation:** Spring will create an instance of `StartupData` when the application context is initialized.
2.  **Dependency Injection:** Other beans in the application can depend on `StartupData`, and Spring will automatically inject an instance of this class into those beans, eliminating the need for manual object creation and wiring.
3.  **Lifecycle Management:** Spring manages the lifecycle of the `StartupData` bean, including creation, initialization, and destruction.
4.  **Singleton Scope (by default):** Unless a different scope is specified, Spring creates a single instance of `StartupData` and shares it across the entire application context.
5.  **Auto-discovery:**  Spring's component scanning mechanism will search for classes annotated with `@Component` (or its specialized forms like `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`) and register them as beans.
