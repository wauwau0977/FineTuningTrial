For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.spec.ts' with name 'client-id.service.spec.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the purpose of the first `it` block ("should be created"). What is it testing and why is it often included as the first test case in a test suite like this one? What does it actually *verify*?
