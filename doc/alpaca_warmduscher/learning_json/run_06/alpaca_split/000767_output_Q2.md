As the `heat_pump` table grows to millions of records, the `getLastEntries(int maxRows)` query, while seemingly simple, can become a performance bottleneck. The primary concern is that without proper indexing, the database might need to perform a full table scan to identify the last 'maxRows' entries. This scan becomes increasingly expensive as the table size increases, leading to longer query execution times.

**Performance Concerns:**

1.  **Full Table Scan:** Without an index, the database has to read every row in the table to determine the most recent entries.
2.  **Sorting:**  To return the *last* 'maxRows', the database might need to sort the table based on a timestamp column (presumably `measurement_date`) before retrieving the desired rows. This sorting operation can be very resource-intensive.
3.  **Disk I/O:** A full table scan and sorting require significant disk I/O, further slowing down the query.

**Indexing Strategies to Mitigate Concerns:**

1.  **Index on `measurement_date`:** The most crucial indexing strategy is to create an index on the `measurement_date` column. This index allows the database to quickly locate the rows with the latest timestamps without scanning the entire table. A B-tree index is generally suitable for this purpose.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_measurement_date ON heat_pump (measurement_date DESC);
    ```

    The `DESC` keyword in the index creation is important. It creates a descending index, meaning that the index is sorted in descending order of `measurement_date`. This is beneficial because it allows the database to efficiently retrieve the last 'maxRows' entries directly from the index without needing to sort the results.

2.  **Combined Index (If Other Filters Are Common):** If the query frequently includes other filters (e.g., based on a specific heat pump ID), consider creating a combined index on `measurement_date` and the other filter columns. This can further improve performance by allowing the database to efficiently filter the results based on multiple criteria.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_measurement_date_heatpumpid ON heat_pump (measurement_date DESC, heatpumpid);
    ```

3.  **Regular Index Maintenance:**  As the table grows and data is updated, the index can become fragmented. Regularly rebuilding or reorganizing the index can help maintain its performance.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., at the application layer or using a database caching feature) to store frequently accessed data and reduce the need to query the database repeatedly.
*   **Pagination:** For very large datasets, consider implementing pagination to retrieve data in smaller chunks, rather than loading all the results at once.
*   **Query Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize the query execution plan to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
