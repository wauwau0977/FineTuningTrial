The primary benefit of using a `HashSet` versus a `List` in the `testDuplicates` method is its constant-time (O(1) on average) complexity for `add` and `contains` operations.

Here's how it contributes to efficiency:

*   **`List`:** If a `List` were used, checking for duplicates would require iterating through the entire list for each generated UUID (O(n) complexity for `contains`). This would result in an overall complexity of O(n^2) for the entire test, where n is the number of UUIDs generated.
*   **`HashSet`:** A `HashSet` uses a hash function to determine the storage location of each element. When adding a new UUID, it calculates its hash code and checks if an element with the same hash code already exists. If it doesn't, the UUID is added. If it does, `add` returns `false`, indicating a duplicate. This check happens in constant time on average.

Therefore, the `testDuplicates` method using a `HashSet` has an average time complexity of O(n), making it significantly more efficient than using a `List` for duplicate detection, especially when a large number of UUIDs are generated.  The test aims to be efficient because we're looking for a potentially *rare* event (a duplicate) and we want to quickly reject the possibility.
