The primary drawback of relying solely on cookies for session management is that cookies are vulnerable to several attacks and limitations:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into your website, they can steal the session cookie and impersonate the user.
2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can trick a user into making unwanted requests to your application while they are authenticated.
3. **Cookie Size Limits:** Cookies have size limitations, which can restrict the amount of data you can store in them.
4. **User Control:** Users can disable cookies or clear them from their browser.
5. **Statelessness Challenges:** Relying solely on cookies makes it harder to build truly stateless applications, as session data is stored on the client-side.

To improve robustness and security, consider these alternative or complementary approaches:

1. **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT):**  Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to store session data in a secure and stateless manner. JWTs can be stored in HTTP headers or cookies, but offer better security features like signing and expiration.
2. **HTTP Headers:** Store session identifiers (e.g., JWTs) in custom HTTP headers instead of cookies. This can mitigate some CSRF risks.
3. **Server-Side Sessions (with Strong Session IDs):**  Store session data on the server and use strong, randomly generated session IDs. This provides greater control and security, but requires server-side storage.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA to add an extra layer of security.
5. **Secure Cookie Attributes:**  If you continue to use cookies, set the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes to protect them from XSS attacks. `Secure` ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS, and `HttpOnly` prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.

A common and recommended approach is to use JWTs stored in HTTP headers or secure cookies, combined with secure cookie attributes. This provides a good balance between security, scalability, and statelessness.
