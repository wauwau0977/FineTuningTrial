The `FormattingConversionService` is a general-purpose service for converting between types, including strings and objects like dates and times. It acts as a central registry for formatters. The custom `Formatter` beans (for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`) are specific implementations of how to parse and format those particular types.

The `FormattingConversionService` uses these custom formatters internally. When a conversion is required (e.g., a string to a `LocalDate`), the service looks up the appropriate formatter (in this case, our custom `localDateFormatter`) and delegates the parsing or formatting operation to it.

The primary use cases are:

*   **FormattingConversionService:** Used implicitly by Spring's data binding and validation mechanisms when handling form submissions, request parameters, and other input values. Spring automatically leverages the formatters registered within it.
*   **Custom Formatter Beans:**  These are useful when you need more fine-grained control over formatting or parsing beyond what the standard Spring mechanisms provide, or when you need to inject dependencies into the formatting logic. They can also be directly used in your service layer if you need to explicitly parse or format dates/times outside the context of Spring's data binding.

In this case, the custom formatters are providing the specific formatting logic for the registered date and time formatters, while the service manages the overall conversion process.
