The `evict` flag, when set to `true`, forces the removal of a specific entry from the `cache`.  Specifically, it sets the value associated with the provided `cacheKey` to `null`. This effectively invalidates any previously cached result for that key.  

The impact on subsequent behavior is that if `get` is called again with the same `cacheKey` after `evict` has been set to `true`, the condition `this.cache[cacheKey] == null` will evaluate to true, triggering the `loader()` function to be called and the cache to be repopulated with the new data. This provides a mechanism for manually clearing specific cache entries when their data is known to be stale or inaccurate.
