A race condition can occur where multiple instances of the `ClientIdService` attempt to read and write the `KEY_CLIENT_ID` from `localStorage` concurrently. Here's how:

1.  **Instance A reads:** Instance A checks `localStorage` for `KEY_CLIENT_ID` and finds nothing.
2.  **Instance B reads:** Before Instance A can generate and write a new ID, Instance B also checks `localStorage` and finds nothing.
3.  **Instance A generates & writes:** Instance A generates a new ID and writes it to `localStorage`.
4.  **Instance B generates & writes:** Instance B *also* generates a new ID and writes it to `localStorage`, *overwriting* the ID written by Instance A.

The result is that only the ID generated by Instance B is preserved, leading to lost client identification for the client associated with Instance A.  This issue is particularly relevant in web applications where multiple browser tabs or windows might be running the same code concurrently, or in environments with asynchronous operations.
