The pattern of storing minimum, maximum, and corresponding measurement dates suggests the entity is designed to efficiently represent a range or distribution of measurements over a specific period. This is a good approach if the application frequently needs to query for the extreme values within a given timeframe without having to perform calculations on a large dataset of individual measurements.

Design considerations:

*   **Reporting/Analytics:** This structure is well-suited for generating reports or performing analytics on historical data, as the minimum and maximum values are readily available.
*   **Pre-aggregation:** It represents a form of pre-aggregation, improving query performance by avoiding the need to calculate min/max values on the fly.

Trade-offs:

*   **Storage Space:** Storing min/max values and their dates increases storage requirements compared to storing only individual measurements.
*   **Data Consistency:**  Maintaining consistency between individual measurements and the pre-aggregated min/max values requires careful consideration and potentially complex update logic.  If individual measurements change, the min/max values must be recalculated.
*   **Flexibility:**  The structure limits the ability to easily query for other statistical measures (e.g., average, standard deviation) without additional data or calculations.
