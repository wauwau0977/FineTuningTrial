For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionDevice.java' with name 'SessionDevice.java' we have the following question: 
Implement the `toString` method for the `SessionDevice` class. The method should return a string representation of the object including the values of `sessionId`, `agentString`, `clientId`, and `ip` in a readable format. If any of these fields are `null`, represent them as the string "null" in the output.
