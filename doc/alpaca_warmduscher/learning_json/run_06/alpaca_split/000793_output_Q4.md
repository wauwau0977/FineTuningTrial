The `deleteMeasurements` method is designed to remove heat pump measurement data from the database based on a specified date range. Its purpose is likely to facilitate data cleanup, archiving, or retention policy enforcement.

**Prevention of Accidental Data Loss:**

A critical safeguard against accidental data loss is a condition check *before* any records are deleted. The method checks if the `measurement_date` is earlier than a given `cutoffDate`. This `cutoffDate` represents the minimum date for measurements to be eligible for deletion.  This condition is vitally important because it ensures that only measurements older than the defined retention period are deleted, preventing the accidental removal of recent or important data. Without this check, a coding error or incorrect parameter could lead to the entire measurement history being erased.

**JPA/Hibernate Concepts & Efficient Deletion:**

Several JPA/Hibernate concepts can be used to efficiently perform the deletion:

*   **JPQL/HQL DELETE Statement:** The most common approach is to use a JPQL/HQL `DELETE` statement with a `WHERE` clause that incorporates the `measurement_date < cutoffDate` condition. This allows the database to efficiently delete matching records.
*   **`@Query` Annotation (Spring Data JPA):** If using Spring Data JPA, the `@Query` annotation can be used to define a native SQL query or a JPQL query that performs the deletion. This provides flexibility in customizing the deletion process.
*   **Entity Manager:** The `EntityManager` (or `Session` in older Hibernate versions) is used to execute the deletion query.
*   **Transaction Management:**  The deletion operation should be performed within a transaction to ensure atomicity and consistency. If the deletion fails midway, the transaction can be rolled back, preventing partial data loss.
*   **Batch Processing (Optional):** For large date ranges, consider implementing batch processing to delete records in smaller chunks. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the database.
