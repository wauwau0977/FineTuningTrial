Using an interface like `BoilerStatsByHour` instead of a concrete class provides several significant advantages related to flexibility, testability, and maintainability.

*   **Flexibility & Decoupling:**  An interface decouples the definition of *what* the boiler statistics represent from *how* those statistics are calculated or stored. This allows for different implementations of the interface without affecting other parts of the system.  For example, we could have one implementation that calculates the statistics in memory, another that fetches them from a database, or a third that streams them from a real-time data source – all while adhering to the same contract defined by the interface.

*   **Testability:** Interfaces facilitate unit testing through the use of mock objects. We can easily create a mock implementation of `BoilerStatsByHour` during testing to isolate the component being tested. This allows us to control the values returned by the methods and verify the behavior of the code that relies on the statistics, without needing to worry about the complexities of the actual data source or calculation logic.

*   **Future Modifications/Extensibility:**  If the requirements change and we need to add more statistics (e.g., standard deviation of temperature, maximum/minimum temperature values), we can simply add new methods to the interface.  Existing code that relies on the interface will not need to be modified, as long as the new methods don’t break the existing contract. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

**Specific Examples:**

1.  **Data Source Flexibility:** Imagine we switch from storing the raw boiler data in a relational database to using a NoSQL database or a message queue.  We can create a new class that implements `BoilerStatsByHour` and fetches the data from the new source, without modifying any code that *uses* the interface.

2.  **Calculation Logic Changes:** If we decide to improve the algorithm for calculating the average temperature difference, we can simply modify the implementation class without affecting any other code that relies on the interface.

3.  **Simplified Mocking:** In a unit test for a report generator that consumes `BoilerStatsByHour` objects, we can create a mock implementation that returns predefined values for each method, allowing us to test the report generation logic in isolation, without needing to access a real data source.

In essence, the interface promotes loose coupling, making the system more modular, testable, and easier to maintain and extend in the future.
