The `@Lob` and `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` annotations are used together to handle large text fields – `message`, `detail`, and `exception` – within the `AuditLogEntity` class.

`@Lob` stands for Large Object and is a JPA annotation that indicates that a field should be persisted as a large object in the database. This tells the persistence provider (in this case, Hibernate) to use a data type suitable for storing large amounts of text data (like `TEXT`, `CLOB`, or `BLOB`).

`@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` is a Hibernate-specific annotation that further refines how the large object is persisted.  Specifically, `org.hibernate.type.TextType` ensures that the field is mapped to a database column that can handle long strings efficiently.  Without this, Hibernate might use a standard string mapping which could have length limitations or performance issues when dealing with very large text values.

Together, these annotations solve the problem of storing potentially very long strings (like error messages, detailed descriptions, or exception stack traces) in a database. Without them, the database column might be limited in length, leading to data truncation or errors. They ensure that these fields are stored correctly and efficiently, preserving the full content of the audit log information. The annotations signal to Hibernate that it should use a database-specific large text type and appropriate handling mechanisms for these fields.
