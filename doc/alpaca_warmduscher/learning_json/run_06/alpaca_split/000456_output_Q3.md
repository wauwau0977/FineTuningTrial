The `public` keyword before each parameter in the constructor is a TypeScript feature that automatically declares and initializes a class attribute with the same name and value as the corresponding parameter. It's a shorthand way of both declaring a private attribute and assigning it a value from the constructor arguments in a single line. Without `public`, the parameters would only exist within the scope of the constructor, and you would need to explicitly declare the attributes and assign the parameter values to them. This improves code conciseness and readability. Effectively, it creates instance variables directly from the constructor parameters, making them accessible throughout the class.
