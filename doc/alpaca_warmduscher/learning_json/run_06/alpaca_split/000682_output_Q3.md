The `@Scheduled` annotation on the `logStartup` method indicates that this method should be executed according to a predefined schedule. In this case:

*   `initialDelay = 50`: The method will be executed for the first time after an initial delay of 50 milliseconds.
*   `fixedDelay = Long.MAX_VALUE`:  This essentially means the method will only execute *once* after the initial delay. Because the `fixedDelay` is set to the maximum long value, the scheduler will not reschedule the method for subsequent execution.

The method's purpose is to log startup information to the audit log. Specifically, it collects several pieces of data and saves them as a JSON string within an `AuditLogEntity`:

*   `startupTimes`: Data from the `startupData` object, likely containing timing information related to the application's startup process.
*   `memoryInfo`: Current memory usage information obtained from the `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` method.
*   `serverInfo`: Information about the server, as held within the `infoBean` object.

This data is combined into a `TreeMap` (ensuring key ordering), converted to a JSON string using `Utils.toJSON()`, and then saved to the audit log with a category of "SERVER", a type of "START", and an event of "STARTUP". This provides a historical record of the application's startup state, including timing, memory usage, and server configuration.
