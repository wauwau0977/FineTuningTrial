The key difference lies in the method of grouping data *before* applying the aggregation functions:

*   **`findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats`**: This method uses `ntile(:maxRows)` to divide the data into a fixed *number* of groups.  The size of each group (in terms of time or data points) is not fixed; it depends on the distribution of the data and the number of rows. This effectively limits the *number of rows* returned per station, by dividing the data into `:maxRows` buckets.

*   **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`**: This method uses `round(extract(epoch from temperature_measure_date) / :group_every_nth_second)` to group data into fixed *time intervals*.  The length of each group is determined by the `:group_every_nth_second` parameter. This ensures that each group represents a specific duration, regardless of the amount of data within it.

Here’s when you’d choose one over the other:

*   **`findBetweenDatesLimitByRowsStats`**:  Use this when you need to limit the total amount of data returned and don't care about strict time intervals.  For example, if you’re building a dashboard and want to display a maximum number of data points per station to avoid performance issues, this method is suitable. It’s good when you just want to reduce the number of results and the granularity isn't as important.

*   **`findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats`**: Use this when you need to analyze trends over specific time intervals. For example, if you’re calculating hourly average temperatures or generating reports with consistent time granularity, this method is more appropriate. It's perfect for time series analysis where consistent intervals are critical for accurate trend identification.
