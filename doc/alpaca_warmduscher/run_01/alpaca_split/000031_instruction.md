You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a simple Spring component, `StartupData`, designed to store the time taken during application startup. This allows for monitoring and analysis of application initialization performance. It is a data holder class, offering getter and setter methods for a single long value representing startup time.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `StartupData`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code provides a mechanism to store and retrieve the application startup time.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: There are no direct user inputs or outputs. The data is populated and read programmatically by other components within the application.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Another component calculates the application startup time.
    2. This component calls the `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method of the `StartupData` instance to store the calculated time.
    3. Other components can call the `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method to retrieve the stored startup time for logging, monitoring, or reporting.
- **External Interactions**:  None. This class operates solely in memory.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: There are no specific edge cases handled within this class itself.  The calling components are responsible for handling potential errors during time calculation or data access.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The class is lightweight and operations (get/set) are expected to be very fast (sub-millisecond).
- **Scalability**:  The class itself does not contribute to scalability concerns. Scalability would be determined by the broader application architecture.
- **Security**: No security implications. The data is not sensitive.
- **Maintainability**: Code is simple and easy to understand and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Class is simple, so low risk of failure.
- **Usability**: Easy to integrate into the Spring application context and use via dependency injection.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()`: Retrieves the startup time in milliseconds.
    - `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis)`: Sets the startup time in milliseconds.
- **Important logic flows**:  Simple get/set operations.
- **Error handling**:  No explicit error handling.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: Part of the `utils.spring` package, suggesting utility functions for Spring-based applications.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Primitive data types (long)
- Standard getter and setter methods

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**: Used for component scanning and dependency injection via the `@Component` annotation.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly declared within this class.  However, it assumes the existence of a Spring application context.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** No significant performance enhancements needed given the simplicity of the class.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already highly readable.
- **Security Improvements:** No security concerns.
- **Scalability Considerations:** No scalability issues with this class directly. However, consider if the startup time is recorded to a central monitoring system to allow for tracking over time and potentially scaling the application based on observed startup trends.
- **Consider adding logging**: Adding logging within the setter to record when the startup time is set would be beneficial for troubleshooting.
