Angular Material's flex-box layout system, powered by Angular Flex-Layout, is extensively used in this HTML to create a responsive and flexible user interface. Here's a breakdown of how the `fxLayout`, `fxShow`, `fxFill`, and other related directives influence the positioning and sizing of elements:

**1. `fxLayout` Directive:**

*   `fxLayout` is the core directive for enabling flex-box layout. It defines the layout direction and alignment of items within a container.
*   **`fxLayout.xs="column"` and `fxLayout.gt-xs="row"`:** This combination creates a responsive layout. On extra-small screens (xs), the elements within the container are arranged in a column (vertical). On screens larger than extra-small (gt-xs), the elements are arranged in a row (horizontal). This is a common technique for adapting the layout to different screen sizes.

**2. `fxShow` Directive:**

*   `fxShow.gt-sm` : This directive conditionally shows/hides elements based on screen size. `fxShow.gt-sm` means the element will only be displayed on screens larger than small (sm). This is used to selectively show/hide elements for better responsiveness.

**3. `fxFill` Directive:**

*   `fxFill` is used to distribute available space within a flex-box container.
*   The use of `fxFill` without a specific value implies that the element should fill the available space within its container. This allows elements to grow and shrink to fit the available space.

**4. Specific Layout Examples:**

*   **Date Selector:**
    *   `fxLayout.xs="column"` : Arranges the date input fields vertically on small screens.
    *   `fxLayout.gt-xs="row"` : Arranges the date input fields horizontally on larger screens.
    *   `fxShow.gt-sm` : Used to show a division between date input.
*   **Chart Layout:**  The numerous `mat-card` elements likely use `fxLayout` to arrange charts horizontally or vertically, depending on the screen size.

**5. Influence on Positioning and Sizing:**

*   **Dynamic Sizing:** Flex-box allows elements to dynamically size based on their content and the available space.
*   **Alignment:** Flex-box provides control over the alignment of items within a container (e.g., horizontally, vertically).
*   **Order:** The order of items within a flex-box container can be controlled, regardless of their source order in the HTML.
*   **Responsiveness:** By combining `fxLayout` with different media queries (e.g., `xs`, `gt-xs`, `sm`, `gt-sm`), you can create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

**In summary:**

The Angular Flex-Layout directives in this HTML are used to create a responsive and flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. These directives provide control over the positioning, sizing, and alignment of elements within the page, allowing for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across a range of devices. The combination of directives makes the layout dynamic and flexible, creating a better user experience on different screen sizes.
