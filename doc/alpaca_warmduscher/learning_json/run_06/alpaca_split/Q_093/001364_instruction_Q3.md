For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/dialogflow/DialogFlowWebhookController.java' with name 'DialogFlowWebhookController.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest request = jacksonFactory
               .createJsonParser(rawData)
               .parse(GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3WebhookRequest.class);
```

What is the role of the `jacksonFactory` in this code snippet, and what does this line of code accomplish?
