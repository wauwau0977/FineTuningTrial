The core reason to use `AutowireCapableBeanFactory` is its ability to autowire *existing* bean instances. A standard `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext` is designed to create and manage beans within the context lifecycle. They're focused on bean definition and instantiation.

`AutowireCapableBeanFactory` specifically provides the `autowireBean()` method, which allows you to take an *already existing* object and have Spring attempt to resolve and inject its dependencies.  This is exactly what the `BeanUtils.autoWire()` method does.  A regular `BeanFactory` or `ApplicationContext` would not have this capability. They are designed to manage beans from their creation onwards, not to inject dependencies into beans that have been instantiated outside of the Spring container's control.

In short, `AutowireCapableBeanFactory` provides the runtime capability to dynamically resolve and inject dependencies into objects that were not originally managed by the Spring container.
