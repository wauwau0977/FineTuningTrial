`enableProdMode()` is an Angular function that optimizes the application for production by disabling development-time features like change detection and additional logging. This results in a smaller application bundle size and improved runtime performance. It’s conditionally executed based on the value of `environment.production`. 

`environment.production` is typically a boolean flag set in the `environment.ts` (or similar) configuration file.  It signals whether the application is being run in a development or production environment.  During development, this flag is usually set to `false`, allowing for helpful debugging tools and slower, more verbose execution. In production, it’s set to `true`, triggering the optimization performed by `enableProdMode()`.

The implications of *not* enabling production mode in a deployed application are significant:

*   **Performance Degradation:** The application will be slower due to the overhead of development-time features.
*   **Larger Bundle Size:**  Development-related code will be included in the production bundle, increasing download times.
*   **Security Concerns:**  Development features could expose debugging information or vulnerabilities.
*   **Increased Resource Usage:** The application will consume more memory and CPU resources.
