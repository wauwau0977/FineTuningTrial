When writing unit tests for `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation`, the following edge cases and boundary conditions are crucial:

1.  **Zero Temperature:** `temperature = 0`. This tests the behavior of the formula at a common temperature.
2.  **Maximum and Minimum Temperatures:** Test the upper and lower limits of the expected temperature range (e.g., -40°C and +40°C, or whatever range the formula is valid for). This verifies correct handling at the boundaries.
3.  **Zero Relative Humidity:** `relativeHumidity = 0`.  This tests the case where there is no humidity.
4.  **100% Relative Humidity:** `relativeHumidity = 1.0` (or 100 if represented as an integer percentage). This tests maximum humidity.
5.  **Negative Temperature (near absolute zero):** Test values approaching absolute zero (e.g., -273.15°C). This tests the formula’s behavior at extremely low temperatures. While unlikely in a sensor context, it's a good edge case.
6. **Temperature = -243.5:**  This is the boundary condition that leads to division by zero and should be tested explicitly to ensure the preventative measures implemented in the production code are effective.
7.  **Values near 0 and 1 for relative humidity:** Test values like 0.001 and 0.999 to verify the calculations are stable and accurate at the extreme ends of the humidity range.
8.  **Typical Values:** Test with common and realistic temperature and humidity combinations to ensure the formula produces expected results in normal operating conditions.

Why these are prioritized:

*   **Boundary conditions** are critical because errors often occur at the limits of input values.
*   **Zero values** often reveal special case handling issues.
*   **Extreme values** help assess the robustness and stability of the formula.
*   **Realistic values** verify the overall accuracy of the implementation in typical use cases.
*   Testing the value that causes division by zero explicitly verifies the logic to avoid it is working correctly.
