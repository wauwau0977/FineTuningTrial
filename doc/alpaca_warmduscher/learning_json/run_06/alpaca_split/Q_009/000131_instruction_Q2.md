For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.spec.ts' with name 'app.component.spec.ts'... 
Considering the following test case:

```typescript
it(`should have as title 'thserver-client'`, () => {
   const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
   const app = fixture.componentInstance;
   expect(app.title).toEqual('thserver-client');
});
```

How does this test ensure the application's title is correctly initialized, and what potential issues might this test *not* catch regarding the application title?
