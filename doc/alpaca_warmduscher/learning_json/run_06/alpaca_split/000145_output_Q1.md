The current code doesn't unsubscribe from the `interval` observable. This means the subscription will continue to run even after the component is destroyed, leading to a memory leak. The `interval` observable continuously emits values, and if the component is navigated away from without unsubscribing, the `myFullPageRefresh` function will still be called, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix this, we need to unsubscribe from the `interval` observable in the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook. Here's the modified component:

```typescript
import { Component, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from "rxjs";
import { environment } from "../environments/environment";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnDestroy {
  title = 'thserver-client';

  constructor() {
    console.log("Setup the page refresh mechanism all " + environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds + " seconds.");
    // figure out a client id
  }

  myFullPageRefresh(): void {
    window.location.reload();
  }

  subscribe: any; // changed type to any for compatibility

  ngOnInit() {
    this.subscribe = interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000).subscribe(
      val => {
        console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")
        this.myFullPageRefresh();
      }
    );
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    if (this.subscribe) {
      this.subscribe.unsubscribe();
      console.log("Interval subscription unsubscribed.");
    }
  }
}
```

By unsubscribing in `ngOnDestroy`, we ensure that the observable's resources are released when the component is destroyed, preventing memory leaks and improving application performance and stability.
