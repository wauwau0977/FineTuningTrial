For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass' with name 'app.component.sass'... 
The code defines a `.toolbarNav` class with `position: fixed`, `bottom: 0`, and `z-index: 1000`. Considering a scenario where the content of the page is dynamically loaded and might exceed the viewport height, potentially obscuring the toolbar, how would you approach ensuring the toolbar *always* remains visible, and what CSS properties or techniques would you utilize? Explain your reasoning.
