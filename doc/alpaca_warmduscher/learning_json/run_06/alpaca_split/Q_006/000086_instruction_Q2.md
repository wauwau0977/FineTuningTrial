For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app-routing.module.ts' with name 'app-routing.module.ts'...
Considering the provided `app-routing.module.ts` file, the `routes` constant is currently an empty array. If we wanted to add a route that maps the path `/home` to a component named `HomeComponent`, how would you modify this file? Please provide the necessary import statement *and* the modification to the `routes` array.
