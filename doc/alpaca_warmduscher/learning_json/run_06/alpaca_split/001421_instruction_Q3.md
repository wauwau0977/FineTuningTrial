For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/InfoService.java' with name 'InfoService.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
   private final InfoBean infoBean;
   public InfoService(InfoBean infoBean) {
       this.infoBean = infoBean;
   }
```
What is the purpose of dependency injection used in this part of the code, and how does it contribute to the design of the `InfoService` class?
