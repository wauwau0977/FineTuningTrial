The current approach, while functional, suffers from significant code duplication and makes the component hard to maintain and read. Each subscription block essentially repeats the same logic: fetching data, transforming it, and updating a corresponding chart.

Potential drawbacks include:

*   **Code Duplication:**  Makes it harder to modify or fix bugs across all charts consistently.
*   **Increased Complexity:** Makes the component long and difficult to understand.
*   **Difficulty in Testing:** Testing each data loading and chart updating scenario becomes tedious.
*   **Tight Coupling:** The component is tightly coupled to the specific services, making it harder to change or mock them during testing.

Refactoring could involve:

1.  **Extract a Common Function:** Create a function (e.g., `processChartData(data, chartType)`) that takes the raw data and the chart type as input, processes the data appropriately, and updates the corresponding chart.
2.  **Use a Single Subscription:** Instead of multiple subscriptions, consider using a `forkJoin` or `combineLatest` to manage all data requests. This provides a way to trigger chart updates only after all required data has been loaded.
3.  **Consider a Service:** Move the data processing logic into a separate service, making the component more focused on presentation.
4.  **Use Observables:** Utilize observables effectively for managing asynchronous operations and handling errors gracefully.
