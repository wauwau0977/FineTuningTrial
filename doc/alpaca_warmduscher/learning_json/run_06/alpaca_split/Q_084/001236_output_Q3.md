The `throws Throwable` clause in both the `before` and `after` methods indicates that these methods are allowed to propagate any type of exception (checked or unchecked) that they might encounter during their execution. This is crucial for flexibility and error handling.

Impact on Implementations: Any class implementing the `Hooks` interface *must* either:

1.  **Handle any exceptions** that might occur within the `before` or `after` methods internally. This could involve `try-catch` blocks to gracefully manage errors and potentially log them or take corrective actions.
2.  **Declare that *it* also `throws Throwable` (or a subclass of `Throwable`)** in its own method signature. This effectively passes the responsibility of handling the exception up the call stack.  This is acceptable if the implementing class doesn't have sufficient information or ability to deal with the exception locally.

This design allows `Hooks` implementations to perform potentially risky operations (e.g., logging, network calls, database access) without being forced to always catch and handle all possible exceptions. It shifts the exception handling burden to the caller, giving them more control over how errors are managed within the broader application context. The use of `Throwable` instead of `Exception` is deliberate, as it also allows propagation of errors like `Error` which typically represent more serious, unrecoverable conditions.
