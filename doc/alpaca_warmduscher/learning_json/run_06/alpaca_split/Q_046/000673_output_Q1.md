Constructor injection provides several benefits in this scenario, making it the preferred method over field or setter injection:

*   **Immutability:** By receiving dependencies through the constructor, these dependencies become final (although not explicitly declared as such in this example, itâ€™s a best practice). This promotes immutability, making the class easier to reason about and less prone to unexpected state changes.
*   **Dependency Clarity:** The constructor clearly defines all the dependencies required by the class. This makes it easy to understand the class's requirements and facilitates testing, as you can easily mock or stub these dependencies.
*   **Early Validation:**  Dependencies are validated during object creation. If a required dependency is missing, the application will fail early in the startup process, making it easier to identify and fix issues.  With field or setter injection, a missing dependency might only be discovered at runtime when the field or setter is actually used.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:**  It avoids the need for `@Autowired` annotations on fields or setter methods, resulting in cleaner code.
*   **Testability:** Constructor injection makes unit testing significantly easier because you can simply create an instance of the class with mocked dependencies.

Compared to field injection, constructor injection prevents potential issues with uninitialized dependencies. Compared to setter injection, it guarantees the dependencies are available immediately after object creation and prevents partially initialized objects.
