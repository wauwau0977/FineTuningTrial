The calculation of `month` as `30.436875 * day` aims to provide a more accurate average month length than simply using 30 days.  Months do not all have the same number of days. Using a fixed value like 30 days would introduce a systematic error in calculations that involve monthly intervals. 

The value `30.436875` is derived from averaging the length of months over a year. Specifically, it's approximately (365.25 days / 12 months = 30.4375 days/month) which accounts for leap years and provides a more representative average for calculations across longer time spans.  While it's still an approximation, it's more precise than simply using 30 days. The comment clarifies this is an average acknowledging the variations in month lengths.
