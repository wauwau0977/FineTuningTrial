The signature of the utility method would be:

```java
public static void executeUnsafeRunnable(UnsafeRunnable runnable) throws Exception {
    try {
        runnable.run();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw e; // Re-throw the exception to be handled by the caller
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`public static void executeUnsafeRunnable(UnsafeRunnable runnable)`:**  It's a public static method, making it easily accessible as a utility. It takes an instance of `UnsafeRunnable` as input.

2.  **`throws Exception`:**  Crucially, the method *declares* that it throws `Exception`. This is because the `UnsafeRunnable` interface allows checked exceptions to be thrown. By re-declaring the exception, we pass the responsibility of handling it to the calling code.

3.  **`try-catch` Block:** The method encloses the `runnable.run()` call within a `try-catch` block to catch any `Exception` that might be thrown.

4.  **`throw e;`:** Inside the `catch` block, the exception is *re-thrown* using `throw e;`.  This ensures that the calling code is aware of the failure and can handle it appropriately.  An alternative would be to wrap the exception, but that obscures the original cause.
