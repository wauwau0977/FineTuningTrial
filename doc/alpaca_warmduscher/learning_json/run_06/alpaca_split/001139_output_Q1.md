Several additions would enhance debugging and error handling. First, adding a field for an error *code* (e.g., an `enum` or integer) would allow for programmatic handling of specific error scenarios without relying solely on parsing the message string. Second, a field to store contextual information, like the specific sensor ID or data point that caused the exception, would be extremely valuable for tracing the origin of the error. A timestamp of when the exception occurred could also be helpful. Finally, adding a method to provide a more structured representation of the exception (e.g., returning a `Map<String, Object>` with error details) could facilitate logging and integration with monitoring systems. This structured data would improve automation and analysis of errors.
