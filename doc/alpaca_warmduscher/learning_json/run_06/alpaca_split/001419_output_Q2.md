Directly calling a static method like `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` within a controller has several potential drawbacks, especially in a production environment.

1.  **Difficult Testing:** Static methods are harder to mock or stub during unit testing.  You can't easily inject a different implementation for testing purposes, making it difficult to isolate the controller's logic and test it independently.
2.  **Hidden Dependencies:** It creates a hidden dependency on the `MemoryInfo` class within the `InfoService`. This makes it less clear what dependencies the controller has and can make refactoring more difficult.
3.  **Reduced Flexibility:**  It limits the ability to change the way memory information is retrieved without modifying the controller.  If you wanted to, for example, cache the memory info, it becomes much harder.
4.  **Concurrency Issues:** If `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` is not thread-safe, it could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption in a multi-threaded environment. While unlikely for a simple 'current' getter, it's a good principle to avoid.

Alternatives to consider:

1.  **Dependency Injection:**  The best approach. Create an interface (e.g., `MemoryInfoProvider`) with a method like `getCurrentMemoryInfo()`. Implement this interface with a class that calls `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`. Inject this implementation into `InfoService` through its constructor. This allows for easy mocking and testing and makes the controller more flexible.
2.  **Service Layer:** Introduce a separate service layer. The controller would call a method on the service layer, which in turn would call `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`. This separates the controller's concerns and promotes a cleaner architecture.
