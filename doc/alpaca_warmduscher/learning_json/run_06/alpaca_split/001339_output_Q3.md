The conditional `if (MySessionFilter.isSessionRelevantRequest(request))` checks if the incoming request is one that should be logged and persisted to the database. The `isSessionRelevantRequest` method (likely defined in the `MySessionFilter` class) determines whether a request is of interest for tracking purposes â€“ potentially filtering out requests for static resources or other non-essential operations.

If the condition is true, a new `SessionRequest` object is created and populated with the following data:

*   `path`: The servlet path of the request.
*   `sessionId`: The session ID retrieved from a cookie.
*   `clientId`: The client ID obtained from the request header.
*   `clientVersion`: The client version obtained from the request header.
*   `ip`: The IP address of the client making the request.
*   `processingTime`: The time taken to process the request (calculated in the `afterCompletion` method).
*   `httpStatus`: The HTTP status code of the response.
*   `exception`: The exception message, if an exception occurred during processing.

This `SessionRequest` object is then saved to the database using the `sessionRequestRepository`. The log message confirms that the request was received and saved, along with the total processing time.
