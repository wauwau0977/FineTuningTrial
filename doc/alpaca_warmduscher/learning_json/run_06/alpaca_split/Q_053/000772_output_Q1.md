The primary goal of using `To_Char(measurement_date, 'DAY')` is to extract the textual representation of the day of the week from the `measurement_date` column. This allows the query to group and analyze boiler statistics based on the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).  The `day_of_week_text` column derived from this function is used in the final `GROUP BY` clause to generate statistics for each day of the week.

However, directly using `To_Char` in SQL for date-based analysis has several potential drawbacks:

*   **Locale Dependency:** The textual representation of the day of the week is locale-dependent. The exact format (e.g., "Monday", "Mon.", "Lun.") will vary based on the database server's locale settings. This can lead to inconsistent results if the database is migrated or the locale is changed.

*   **Sorting Issues:**  Sorting the results based on `day_of_week_text` might not produce the desired order if the textual representation is not consistent or if the desired order is not alphabetically aligned with the textual output.

*   **Performance:** String comparisons are generally slower than integer comparisons.  Using `To_Char` forces the database to perform string comparisons, which can negatively impact query performance, especially with large datasets.

*   **Data Consistency:** Different locales might use different abbreviations or full names for days of the week, leading to data inconsistencies if the application expects a specific format.

A more robust and reliable approach would be to extract the day of the week as an integer (e.g., 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday) using database-specific functions like `EXTRACT(DOW FROM measurement_date)` or `DAYOFWEEK(measurement_date)` and then use this integer value for grouping and sorting. This eliminates locale dependencies and improves performance.
