A concrete implementation of `MeteoDataService` would likely source data from an external provider â€“ MeteoSwiss, as suggested by the package name.  This could be via a REST API, a SOAP web service, or perhaps a file download (e.g., CSV, JSON). The `init()` method would be responsible for establishing this connection (authentication, initial data pull for caching) and setting up any necessary resources.

The `init()` method might perform the following actions:
1.  Establish connection to MeteoSwiss data source.
2.  Handle authentication if required.
3.  Perform an initial data fetch to populate a local cache (in-memory, database, or dedicated caching system like Redis).
4.  Potentially schedule a periodic task (using a scheduler like Quartz or a simple Timer) to refresh the data cache at regular intervals. This ensures the data remains relatively current.

The `getData()` method would then retrieve the data from this local cache, formatted as a `List<MeteoSwissEntity>`. The cache would likely be the primary source for performance reasons, reducing the need to hit the external MeteoSwiss API on every request.

Regarding persistence, the `MeteoSwissEntity` objects could be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).  The choice depends on the expected data volume, query patterns, and scalability requirements.  The `init()` method could also be responsible for initially populating the database with the fetched data, or the data could be persisted lazily the first time `getData()` is called. The implementation would also need to consider error handling for network issues, API rate limits, and data format inconsistencies.
