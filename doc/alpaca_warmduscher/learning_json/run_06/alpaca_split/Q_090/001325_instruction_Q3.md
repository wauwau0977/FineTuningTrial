For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MvcConfig.java' with name 'MvcConfig.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
// Attention: DO NOT ADD... It will override and destroy the applicaiton properties settings
// @EnableWebMvc
```
What does the comment indicate about the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation, and why is it explicitly discouraged here?
