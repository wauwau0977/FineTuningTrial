The `buildTimestampServer` and `buildVersionServer` fields in the `InfoBean` class are initialized using the `@Value` annotation from Spring. This annotation allows injecting values from external sources, such as application properties files, directly into class fields. 

Specifically, `@Value("${thserver.buildTimestampServer}")` instructs Spring to retrieve the value associated with the key `thserver.buildTimestampServer` from the application's property files (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) and assign it to the `buildTimestampServer` field. Similarly, `@Value("${thserver.buildVersionServer}.0")` retrieves the value of `thserver.buildVersionServer` from the properties file, appends ".0" to it, and assigns the resulting string to the `buildVersionServer` field.

Here's the exact code demonstrating their definition:

```java
@Value("${thserver.buildTimestampServer}")
private String buildTimestampServer = "";

@Value("${thserver.buildVersionServer}.0")
private String buildVersionServer = "";
```
