The primary purpose of `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` is to determine an appropriate time interval for data aggregation or visualization, based on the *density* of data points available within a given time range. Itâ€™s likely solving the problem of preventing overly cluttered or unreadable charts/graphs when dealing with large datasets.  The method seems to return a string key representing the interval (e.g., "1d", "1h"), which would likely be used to format or group the data before display.  The tests demonstrate it's selecting intervals to ensure a maximum number of data points are displayed without overlapping or becoming illegible. The logic seems to balance displaying sufficient detail with maintaining readability by dynamically adjusting the interval.
