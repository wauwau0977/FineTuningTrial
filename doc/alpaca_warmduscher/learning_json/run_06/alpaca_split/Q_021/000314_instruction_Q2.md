For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts'... 
The test suite includes the line `expect(component).toBeTruthy();`. What is the purpose of this assertion and what does it verify?  Could a different assertion be used, and if so, what would it be and why might it be preferable?
