For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java' with name 'UnsafeRunnable.java'... 
Suppose you want to extend the functionality of `UnsafeRunnable` to include a context object that is passed to the `run()` method. This context object contains information relevant to the task being executed (e.g., sensor ID, timestamp). How would you modify the interface to accommodate this, and why would this be beneficial?
