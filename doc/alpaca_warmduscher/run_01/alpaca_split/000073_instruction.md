You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements an HTTP interceptor for Angular applications within the 'Warmduscher' project. Its primary function is to automatically add a Client ID and Client Version header to every outgoing HTTP request. This allows the backend to identify the client making the request and its version, potentially for analytics, feature flagging, or compatibility purposes.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `MyHttpInterceptor`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:  Intercepts all outgoing HTTP requests and adds specific headers.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Input**:  An outgoing `HttpRequest` object.
    - **Output**: A modified `HttpRequest` object with added headers, passed to the next handler in the request pipeline, and ultimately the HTTP response.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `intercept` method receives the outgoing `HttpRequest` and the `HttpHandler`.
    2. It retrieves the Client ID from the `ClientIdService`.
    3. It retrieves the Client Version from the `environment` configuration file.
    4. It clones the original request to avoid modifying it directly.
    5. It adds the Client ID and Client Version as headers to the cloned request.
    6. It passes the modified request to the `HttpHandler` for further processing.
- **External Interactions**: 
    - Interaction with `ClientIdService` to obtain the Client ID.
    - Reads the `environment.buildTimestampClient` value from the `environment` file.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If `ClientIdService` fails to provide a Client ID, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the code. It might result in a null or empty Client ID being added to the header.
    - No explicit error handling for the retrieval of the Client Version from the environment file.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The interceptor should add minimal overhead to HTTP requests. Header addition is generally a lightweight operation, but excessive processing within the interceptor could impact performance.
- **Scalability**: The interceptor itself is stateless and should scale well with increased load. The performance is dependent on the `ClientIdService`, which needs to be scalable.
- **Security**:  The added headers do not directly introduce security vulnerabilities. However, the Client ID should be treated as sensitive information if it can be used to identify individual users.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. Using cloning of the request avoids side effects.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The interceptor's availability depends on the availability of the `ClientIdService`.
- **Usability**: The interceptor is designed to be transparent to the calling code.

## 5. Key Components

- **`MyHttpInterceptor` Class**:  Implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- **`intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>>` Function**:  The core function that intercepts requests, adds headers, and passes the modified request to the next handler.
- **`ClientIdService`**: Provides the Client ID.
- **`environment`**: Configuration file holding client version details (`buildTimestampClient`).
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling, relies on the `ClientIdService` to potentially handle errors.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript
- Observable (RxJS)
- Object cloning
- Header manipulation

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **`@angular/core`**:  Angular core module for dependency injection and services.
- **`@angular/common/http`**: Angular HTTP client module for making HTTP requests and using interceptors.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous operations with Observables.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`./client-id.service`**:  Provides the Client ID.
- **`../environments/environment`**: Configuration file containing build-specific information like the Client Version.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**:  Benchmarking the interceptor to identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
- **Code Readability**:  The code is already relatively readable.
- **Security Improvements**:  Consider if the Client ID should be encrypted or hashed for added security.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  Ensure that the `ClientIdService` is scalable to handle a large number of requests.
- **Error Handling**: Implement explicit error handling within the `intercept` method to handle cases where the `ClientIdService` fails to provide a Client ID.  Log the error for debugging.
- **Configuration**: Consider making the header keys configurable instead of hardcoding them within the interceptor. This would provide greater flexibility.
