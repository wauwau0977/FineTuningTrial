The `init()` method is called by Spring after the bean has been constructed and all dependencies have been injected. It provides a good place to perform initialization tasks.

In the provided code, I've added the following logic:

1.  **Configuration Validation:**  It checks if the `mailSender`, `mailPassword`, and `receiverMailsDefault` properties are not empty. If any of them are missing, it logs an error message and throws an `IllegalStateException`.  This ensures that the application fails fast if essential configuration is missing.

2.  **Optional Connection Test:** I've included commented-out code to demonstrate how you could attempt to establish a connection to the mail server.  This is a good way to proactively verify that the configuration is correct. However, I've commented it out because establishing a connection during bean initialization can add to the application's startup time, and it might not be necessary in all cases. If you uncomment this section, ensure that your environment allows for testing the connection during startup (e.g., that the network is available and that the SMTP server is reachable). The exception handling within the connection test will propagate any connection errors as `IllegalStateException` preventing the app from starting with an invalid configuration.

By performing these initialization tasks, you can ensure that the `MailSend` bean is properly configured and ready to send emails when the application starts. This improves the robustness and reliability of your application.
