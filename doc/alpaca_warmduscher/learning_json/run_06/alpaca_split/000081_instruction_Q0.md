You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines the root routing module for the 'Warmduscher' Angular application. Currently, it's a basic setup with no defined routes. It imports the `RouterModule` and `Routes` modules, defines an empty `routes` array, and exports the configured `RouterModule`. Essentially, it sets up the infrastructure for navigation within the application but doesn't yet define *where* the user can navigate *to*.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app-routing.module.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `AppRoutingModule`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:  Provides the foundation for routing in the Angular application.  It initializes the `RouterModule` with a configuration object.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This module doesn’t have direct user inputs or outputs.  It *enables* other parts of the application to respond to user navigation.  The output is a configured `RouterModule` available for use in the application's main module.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The module imports necessary Angular modules, defines an empty array for routes, and then creates a module that imports and exports the configured router.
- **External Interactions**:  No direct external interactions.  It relies on Angular’s built-in routing mechanisms.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Currently, there are no routes defined.  Adding routes would require handling cases where a requested route doesn't match a defined path (e.g., displaying a 404 error).  This module itself doesn't handle such cases.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal performance impact, as it's a basic setup.  The actual performance will depend on the complexity of routes added later.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability is not a primary concern at this stage.  However, a well-structured routing system is essential for larger applications.
- **Security**: No direct security implications in the current state. Security would need to be addressed when defining routes and implementing access control.
- **Maintainability**: The current code is simple and easy to maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The code is reliable in its current state, as it is a basic setup.
- **Usability**: Not directly applicable. This is infrastructure code.
- **Compliance**:  No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **`AppRoutingModule` Class:**  This class encapsulates the routing configuration and makes it available to the rest of the application.
- **`routes` Constant:**  An empty array (`const routes: Routes = [];`) that will eventually hold the defined routes for the application.
- **`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)`:** Configures the root router with the specified routes.
- **`NgModule`**:  Defines the `AppRoutingModule` as an Angular module, importing and exporting the `RouterModule`.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and code organization.
- **ES Modules**: Used for modular code structure.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **`@angular/core`**: Provides core Angular functionalities, including the `NgModule` decorator.
- **`@angular/router`**: Provides the routing functionality for Angular applications, including `RouterModule` and `Routes`.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None at this stage.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Route Definition**: The most important improvement is to define routes for the application's different views or components.
- **Lazy Loading**:  For larger applications, consider using lazy loading to improve initial load time.
- **Route Guards**: Implement route guards to protect sensitive routes and control access.
- **Error Handling**: Add a default route to handle unknown routes and display a 404 error page.
- **Parameterization**: Use route parameters to pass data between different views.
- **Wildcard Route**: Implement a wildcard route (`**`) to catch all unmatched routes and redirect to a specific component (e.g., a 404 page).
