**Advantages of Native SQL Queries:**

*   **Performance:** Native SQL can often be more performant, especially for complex queries, as you have complete control over the SQL executed and can optimize it specifically for the database. You avoid the overhead of JPA's object-relational mapping and query translation.
*   **Complex Features:** Native SQL allows you to use database-specific features or functions that are not directly supported by JPA or QueryDSL, such as window functions, advanced indexing options, or custom stored procedures.
*   **Legacy Databases:** Useful when interacting with legacy databases that have specific SQL dialects or schemas not easily handled by JPA.

**Disadvantages of Native SQL Queries:**

*   **Portability:** Native SQL queries are tied to a specific database system. Switching to a different database would require significant code changes.
*   **Maintainability:** Native SQL can be harder to read and maintain than JPA's Criteria API or QueryDSL, which provide a more object-oriented and type-safe way to build queries.
*   **Security Risks:**  Directly concatenating user input into native SQL queries can open up SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Proper parameterization is essential, but it requires careful attention.
*   **Type Safety:**  Native SQL queries lack the type safety provided by JPA or QueryDSL, which can lead to runtime errors if the query returns unexpected data types.
*   **Testing:**  Native SQL queries can be more difficult to test because they require setting up a database connection and executing the query directly.

In the context of this repository, the developers likely chose native SQL because they needed the performance and flexibility to implement the specific time-based bucketing and aggregation logic efficiently. The need to use functions like `ntile` and precise control over the SQL execution may have outweighed the portability and maintainability benefits of JPA or QueryDSL. However, it's crucial to ensure that the queries are properly parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
