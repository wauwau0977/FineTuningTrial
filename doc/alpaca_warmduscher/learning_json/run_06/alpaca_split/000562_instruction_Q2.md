For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.html' with name 'overview-current.component.html'... 
Considering the following line: `{{heatingEntity.boilerTemp | number: '1.1-1'}} Â°C`, explain the purpose of the `number` pipe and what the argument `'1.1-1'` does.  What are potential drawbacks of using this formatting approach?
