For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass' with name 'app.component.sass'... The code includes a commented-out CSS rule: `//button:hover, //.active-link // color: blueviolet`. What does this suggest about the intended functionality, and how would you approach implementing this feature in a way that promotes code quality and maintainability?
