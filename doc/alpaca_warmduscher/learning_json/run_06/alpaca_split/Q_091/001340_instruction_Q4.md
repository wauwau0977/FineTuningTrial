For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java' with name 'MyRequestInterceptor.java' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `afterCompletion` method. Detail what information is extracted from the request and response objects, how it's used to create a `SessionRequest` object, and under what conditions this object is persisted to the database. Also explain the logging behavior within this method, differentiating between relevant and irrelevant requests.
