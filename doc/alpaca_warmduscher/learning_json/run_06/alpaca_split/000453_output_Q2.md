Using `public` access modifiers directly in the constructor parameters is a concise way to declare and initialize class properties in TypeScript. It essentially combines property declaration and assignment in a single step. However, it has both advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages:**

*   **Conciseness:** It reduces boilerplate code.  Without `public`, you would need to declare each property separately and then assign it in the constructor body. This makes the code more readable and compact.
*   **Readability:** It clearly shows the properties of the class and how they are initialized at construction.
*   **Automatic Property Creation:** TypeScript automatically creates and initializes the class properties with the values passed to the constructor.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Reduced Flexibility:**  It limits the ability to perform more complex initialization logic or validations within the constructor. If you need to transform the input values before assigning them to the properties, you cannot easily do so with this approach.  Any transformation must happen *before* the constructor is called.
*   **Limited Control:** You lose some control over the property assignment process. If you need to perform side effects or other operations during assignment, it becomes more difficult.
*   **Potential for Accidental Modification:** Since the properties are public, they can be modified directly from outside the class.  While this isn't necessarily a disadvantage in all cases, it can lead to unintended side effects if not carefully managed.
*   **Refactoring Challenges:** If you later decide to change the initialization logic or add validation, you will need to modify the constructor parameters, which can be more disruptive than modifying the constructor body.

In the context of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`, if the properties were solely initialized with the provided constructor parameters and no complex logic or validation was required, the `public` access modifier approach is perfectly acceptable and even preferable due to its conciseness. However, if thereâ€™s a possibility that the initialization process might become more complex in the future, using private or protected properties with a more traditional constructor approach would provide greater flexibility and control.  I often prefer to be explicit and provide greater control, even if it adds a few lines of code.
