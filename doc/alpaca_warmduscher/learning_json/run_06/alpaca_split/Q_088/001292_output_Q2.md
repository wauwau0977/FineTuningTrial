The "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" header indicates whether or not cross-site requests should be handled with credentials (cookies, authorization headers, TLS client certificates). Setting it to "true" allows the browser to include credentials in cross-origin requests.

When `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header *cannot* be set to "*".  It must be a specific origin (e.g., `http://example.com`).  The wildcard "*" is not allowed when credentials are being sent, as it would create a significant security risk. The browser will block the request if `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is "true" and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is "*". This is a crucial security measure to prevent unauthorized access to resources that require credentials.
