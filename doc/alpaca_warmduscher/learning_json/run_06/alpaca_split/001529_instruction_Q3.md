For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
assertTrue(ah > 13.7 && ah < 13.9);
```
What is the purpose of this assertion in the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` test? Explain what this line is verifying and what might happen if the condition `ah > 13.7 && ah < 13.9` evaluates to false.
