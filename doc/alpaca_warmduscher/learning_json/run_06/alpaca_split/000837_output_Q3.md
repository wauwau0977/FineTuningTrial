The `extends` keyword indicates that `AuditLogRepository` is inheriting from the `CrudRepository` interface. This means `AuditLogRepository` gains all the methods defined in the `CrudRepository` interface as if they were declared directly within it. It's a form of inheritance, allowing `AuditLogRepository` to reuse existing functionality and focus on potentially adding custom query methods or behaviors specific to `AuditLogEntity`. Essentially, it's building upon an existing foundation of database operations provided by Spring Data JPA, creating a specialized repository for audit logs.
