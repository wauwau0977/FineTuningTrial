```typescript
expect(component.title).toBe('Default Title');
```

This assertion would be placed inside an `it()` block (e.g., `it('should initialize title correctly', () => { ... });`) and would verify that the value of the `title` property on the `component` instance is equal to 'Default Title' after the component has been created. It relies on the fact that `component` holds the instance of `OverviewCurrentComponent` created by the test fixture.
