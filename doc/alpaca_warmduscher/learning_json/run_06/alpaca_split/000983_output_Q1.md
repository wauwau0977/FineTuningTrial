These overrides are essential for ensuring that instances of `AuditLogEntity` can be correctly compared for equality and used as keys in collections like `HashSet` or as keys in a `HashMap`. Without these overrides, the default implementations inherited from `Object` would compare object *references* (memory addresses) rather than the actual content of the objects.  This means two `AuditLogEntity` objects with the same `id` would be considered different if they are distinct objects in memory.

The crucial relationship is that whenever you override `equals()`, you *must* also override `hashCode()`. This is because:

* **Consistency:** If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, their `hashCode()` must also be equal.
* **Contract Requirements:**  Collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet` rely on the `hashCode()` to determine where to store objects. If `equals()` returns true but `hashCode()` returns different values, the collection won't be able to find the objects correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

In this specific implementation, the `id` field is used for both `equals()` and `hashCode()` ensuring that two `AuditLogEntity` objects are considered equal if and only if they have the same `id`.
