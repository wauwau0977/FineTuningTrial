The `@SpringBootTest` annotation instructs Spring Boot to create a fully-fledged application context for this test class. This means Spring Boot will scan the application for components (beans, services, configurations, etc.) and instantiate them, creating a complete, running instance of the application within the test environment.

The implications for resources are significant.  Spring Boot will:

*   **Scan for Components:** It searches for components based on the application's configuration and the package structure.
*   **Bean Creation:**  It creates all the beans defined in your application, including those managed by Spring's dependency injection.
*   **Data Source:** If a data source is configured in the application, Spring Boot will start it and potentially populate it with test data (depending on other configurations).
*   **Server (potentially):** Depending on the configuration (and if the application embeds a server like Tomcat), it could start an embedded server.
*   **Resource Loading:** Loads configuration files (application.properties/yml) and other resources needed by the application.

Because it loads the entire application context, the test will consume more resources (memory, CPU) compared to a simple unit test. It also makes the test slower to execute, as it needs to perform the initialization of the entire application.
