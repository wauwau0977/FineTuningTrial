The `@Component` annotation marks the `MeteoDataMockImpl` class as a Spring-managed component. This means that Spring will automatically detect, instantiate, and manage this class as a bean within its application context. This allows Spring to handle dependencies and lifecycle management of this class.

The `@Profile(Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK)` annotation specifies that this component should only be activated when the Spring application is run with the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile.  Profiles are a mechanism in Spring that allows you to conditionally enable or disable components based on the environment or configuration being used.  

In effect, this class is a mock implementation of the `MeteoDataService`.  It will only be used when the application is explicitly configured to use the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile.  This is useful for testing, development, or situations where you need to simulate data without connecting to a real MeteoSwiss data source.  If the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile is *not* active, Spring will ignore this component and potentially use a different implementation of `MeteoDataService`.  This provides a flexible way to swap out implementations without changing the code.
