For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataService.java' with name 'MeteoDataService.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
public interface MeteoDataService {
   void init();
   List<MeteoSwissEntity> getData();
}
```
What is the purpose of the `init()` method within this interface?  Considering the context, what kind of operations might be performed during the initialization process?
