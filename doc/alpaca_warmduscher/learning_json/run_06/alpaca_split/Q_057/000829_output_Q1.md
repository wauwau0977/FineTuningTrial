To retrieve all audit logs with a specific `message` value, we'd need to add a custom query method to the interface. Spring Data JPA supports query derivation based on method names. We would add a method with a name following a convention that Spring Data JPA can understand.  For example:

```java
List<AuditLogEntity> findByMessage(String message);
```

Spring Data JPA would automatically translate this method name into a corresponding JPA query, searching for `AuditLogEntity` records where the `message` field matches the provided string.  The framework handles the query generation and execution without any explicit query definition in the code.
