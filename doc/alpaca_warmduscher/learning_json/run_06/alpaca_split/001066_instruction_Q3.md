For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingDataReadServiceMock.java' with name 'HeatingDataReadServiceMock.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
   @Override
   public List<String> scanAllRegisters(int maxRegister) {
       return List.of("Not implemented");
   }
```

What is the purpose of the `scanAllRegisters` method, and what does its current implementation indicate about the functionality of this mock service?
