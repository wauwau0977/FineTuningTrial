For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java'... 
The interface includes `Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`.  Why use `Long` instead of `Integer` for representing the number of records? What kind of scenario would necessitate a `Long` here?
