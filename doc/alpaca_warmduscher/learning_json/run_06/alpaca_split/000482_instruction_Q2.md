For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/heatingEntity.ts' with name 'heatingEntity.ts'... 
The `HeatingEntity` class has many properties, all initialized in the constructor. Considering maintainability and potential future changes, what are the potential drawbacks of this approach, and how might you refactor it to address them? Please specifically consider the impact of adding or removing properties.
