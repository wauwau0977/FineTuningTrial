Using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) as the primary key offers several benefits, particularly in a distributed system.  Its primary advantage is that it allows generating unique IDs without requiring coordination with a central authority like a database sequence. This is critical in a distributed environment where multiple servers might be inserting data simultaneously.  It avoids potential ID conflicts and simplifies scaling.

However, UUIDs have drawbacks:

*   **Storage Space:** UUIDs are typically 128 bits (36 characters as a string), taking up more storage space than an integer (e.g., 32 or 64 bits).
*   **Indexing Performance:** UUIDs are inherently random, leading to potential performance issues with database indexes.  Random inserts can cause page splits and fragmentation, slowing down index lookups. Strategies like UUIDv7 (time-ordered) mitigate this.
*   **Readability:**  UUIDs are less human-readable than auto-incrementing integers, making debugging and manual inspection more difficult.

Auto-incrementing integers are more compact and efficient for indexing if you're working within a single database instance.  However, they require a centralized sequence, which becomes a bottleneck in a distributed system and necessitate complex ID generation strategies.  For this project and given the potential for distribution, the UUID approach is likely chosen for its scalability and independence.
