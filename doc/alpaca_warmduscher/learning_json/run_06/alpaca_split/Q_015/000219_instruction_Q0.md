You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `HeatingDataService`, is a central component for retrieving heating and meteorological data from a remote server. It provides a caching mechanism to optimize performance and reduce server load. It offers methods to fetch current and historical data for heat pump operations, boiler statistics, and meteorological data from MeteoSwiss. The service utilizes HTTP requests to communicate with the server and `CacheService` for data caching.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingDataService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Retrieve current heat pump data.
    - Retrieve historical heat pump data within a specified date range.
    - Retrieve boiler statistics by day of the week.
    - Retrieve boiler statistics by hour.
    - Retrieve sole temperature delta stats during operation.
    - Retrieve current meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    - Retrieve historical meteorological data from MeteoSwiss within a specified date range.
    - Retrieve general server information.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:** Date ranges (from, to), maximum rows, grouping intervals (seconds), station IDs (for MeteoSwiss), eviction cache flag (boolean).
    - **Outputs:** JSON responses containing heating and meteorological data, or server information.  Data is formatted as Observable responses.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - Each data retrieval method constructs HTTP parameters based on input values.
    - Methods utilize the `CacheService` to check if the requested data is already cached.
    - If data is in the cache, it is returned directly.
    - If not in the cache, an HTTP request is made to the server.
    - The response from the server is cached (using `CacheService`) before being returned.
    - Date/Time conversions are performed using the `moment` library.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **HTTP Requests:**  The service interacts with a remote server using GET requests to various endpoints.
    - **CacheService:** The service depends on the `CacheService` for caching and retrieving data.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Invalid date ranges: The server API is expected to handle invalid date ranges and return an appropriate error response. The service itself doesn't validate the dates.
    - Network errors:  HTTP requests may fail due to network connectivity issues. The Observable will handle these errors and propagate them to the calling component.
    - Server errors: The server API might return error responses (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error). The service passes these error responses through the Observable.
    - Missing station ID (MeteoSwiss): The server API is expected to handle this and provide a reasonable response.
    - Empty Resultsets: The server API should handle requests that yield no data and return an empty array or a suitable null value.
    - Cache Eviction: The `evictCache` flag allows for bypassing the cache to force a refresh of the data.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:
    - Caching is implemented to minimize response times and server load.
    - The average response time for cached data should be less than 200ms.
    - Server response times should be under 2 seconds.
- **Scalability**:
    - The service is designed to handle a moderate number of concurrent requests.  Horizontal scaling of the server API is the primary scaling mechanism.
- **Security**:
    - Data transfer is assumed to be over HTTPS. Authentication and authorization are handled by the server API.
- **Maintainability**:
    - The code is well-structured and modular, with clear separation of concerns.
    - Consistent naming conventions are used.
- **Reliability & Availability**:
    - The caching mechanism improves reliability by providing data even when the server is unavailable.
    - The service itself does not implement any specific fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Usability**: The class is designed to be easy to integrate into other Angular components by utilizing RxJS Observables.
- **Compliance**:  The service doesn't have any specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `convertDate(utcDateText)`: Converts a UTC date string to a JavaScript Date object.
    - `convertDateToTime(utcDateText)`: Converts a UTC date string to a Unix timestamp (milliseconds).
    - `getCurrent(evictCache)`: Retrieves current heat pump data.
    - `getHistorical(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecon)`: Retrieves historical heat pump data.
    - `getServerInfo()`: Retrieves general server information.
    - `getMeteoSwissCurrent(evictCache, stationId)`: Retrieves current meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    - `getMeteoSwissHistorical(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecon, stationIds, doNotCache)`: Retrieves historical meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.
    - `getBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek(evictCache, from, to)`: Retrieves boiler statistics by day of the week.
    - `getBoilerStatsByHour(evictCache, from, to)`: Retrieves boiler statistics by hour.
    - `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats(evictCache, from, to, maxRows, groupEveryNthSecon)`: Retrieves sole temperature delta stats.
- **Important logic flows**: The primary logic flow involves constructing HTTP requests, utilizing the cache, and returning data via RxJS Observables.
- **Error handling**: Errors from HTTP requests are handled by the Observable chain. The service itself doesnâ€™t have dedicated error handling beyond passing through the exception.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The service depends on Angular's `HttpClient` and the custom `CacheService`.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: Arrays, objects
- Date/Time manipulation:  Utilizes the `Date` object directly and the moment library for formatted date/time conversions.
- HTTP requests:  Angular `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular**: Used for dependency injection, Observables, and HTTP client.
- **Moment.js**: Used for date/time manipulation and formatting.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`CacheService`**: A custom service responsible for caching and retrieving data.
- **`environment`**: Configuration file providing the base URL for the API.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**:
    - Explore server-side caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database.
    - Implement more granular caching strategies based on data usage patterns.
- **Code Readability**:
    - Extract commonly used parameters into constants to improve code clarity.
    - Consider using a more descriptive naming convention for cache keys.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Implement input validation to prevent potential injection attacks.
    - Ensure that all communication with the server is over HTTPS.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - Implement a load balancing mechanism to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
    - Consider using a message queue to handle asynchronous requests.
    - The cache could be moved to a distributed caching solution (Redis, Memcached) for greater scalability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms.  Handle different types of errors (e.g., network errors, server errors, invalid data) differently.
- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to cover all critical functionalities and ensure code quality.
