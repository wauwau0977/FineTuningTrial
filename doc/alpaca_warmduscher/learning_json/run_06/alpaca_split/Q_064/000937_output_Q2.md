The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation, provided by Jackson, controls the order in which the properties of this interface are serialized into JSON. Without this annotation, Jackson typically serializes properties based on the order they appear in the interface definition (or getter methods).  This annotation explicitly defines a desired serialization order.

In this case, the JSON output will always have the properties in this order: `dayOfWeekStartingMonday`, `dayOfWeekText`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, `numOfStatisticRecords1`.

For example, if an implementation of this interface had values: `dayOfWeekStartingMonday = 1`, `dayOfWeekText = "Monday"`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease = 2.5`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease = 1.0`, `numOfStatisticRecords1 = 100`, the resulting JSON would be:

```json
{
  "dayOfWeekStartingMonday": 1,
  "dayOfWeekText": "Monday",
  "sumBoilerDiffDecrease": 2.5,
  "sumBoilerDiffIncrease": 1.0,
  "numOfStatisticRecords1": 100
}
```

Without the annotation, the order might vary depending on the implementation and Jackson version. Consistent order is useful for client-side code that expects a specific structure or for debugging and readability.
