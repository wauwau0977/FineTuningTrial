For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java' with name 'HeatPumpRepository.java'... 
The method `getLastEntries(int maxRows)` retrieves the last 'maxRows' entries from the 'heat_pump' table. This appears to be a simple query. However, consider scenarios where the 'heat_pump' table might contain millions of records. What potential performance concerns might arise with this query as the table grows, and what indexing strategies could you implement to mitigate these concerns?
