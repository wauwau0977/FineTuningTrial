`dtProcessing` represents the time taken specifically to process the request *after* the interceptor has retrieved the start time. It's calculated as `System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime` *inside* the `afterCompletion` method. This means it captures the time spent within the controller, service layers, database interactions, and any other operations triggered by the request.

`dtTotal`, on the other hand, represents the total time taken for the entire request lifecycle, from when the interceptor's `preHandle` method is entered to when `afterCompletion` finishes. It's calculated as `System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime` *at the end* of `afterCompletion`. This includes the time spent in the interceptor itself (both `preHandle` and `afterCompletion`), the time spent in the controller and its dependencies, and any other operations triggered by the request.

Therefore, `dtProcessing` provides a more focused metric for the performance of the core request handling logic, while `dtTotal` provides a broader view of the overall request time, including interceptor overhead. Comparing these two values can help pinpoint performance bottlenecks â€“ if `dtProcessing` is significantly larger than `dtTotal`, it suggests the interceptor itself might be contributing to the overall latency.
