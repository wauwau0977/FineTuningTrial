For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
public Double getTemperature() {
    return temperature;
}
public void setTemperature(Double temperature) {
    this.temperature = temperature;
}
```
What is the purpose of these getter and setter methods, and how do they facilitate access and modification of the `temperature` field in this class? Explain the benefit of using these methods instead of directly accessing the field.
