Providing unrestricted access through getters and setters, while simple, can lead to several drawbacks:

1.  **Encapsulation Violation:**  It weakens encapsulation, making it easier for other parts of the application to directly modify the internal state of the `InfoBean` without proper validation or control.
2.  **Data Integrity:**  Unrestricted setters can allow invalid or inconsistent data to be set, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
3.  **Maintainability:**  It makes it harder to change the internal implementation of the class without affecting other parts of the application.

Alternative approaches to consider:

1.  **Immutable Objects:**  Make the fields `private` and `final`, and initialize them through the constructor. This prevents modification after creation, ensuring data integrity.
2.  **Controlled Setters:**  Provide setters only for fields that need to be modified, and include validation logic within the setters to ensure that only valid values are accepted.
3.  **Fluent Interface:** Use a builder pattern or fluent interface to allow controlled creation and modification of the bean's state.
4.  **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use a DTO pattern to decouple the internal representation of the data from the external interface.  The DTO can have a controlled API for accessing and modifying the data.

For this specific case, because the values seem like configuration or build information that isn't expected to change after instantiation, making the fields `private` and `final`, initialized in the constructor, would likely be the most appropriate approach.  This enforces immutability and improves the robustness of the application.
