For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/MutexOperation.java' with name 'MutexOperation.java'... 
Assume you are tasked with building a system where different types of sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure) need to be synchronized using this interface. How would you structure your implementation to accommodate these varying data types while maintaining code reusability and avoiding type casting?
