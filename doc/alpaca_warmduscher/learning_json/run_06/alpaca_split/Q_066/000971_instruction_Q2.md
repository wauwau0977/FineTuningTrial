For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java'... 
The interface includes a `getCompessorState()` method that returns a `Boolean`.  Considering that a compressor might have more complex states (e.g., 'RUNNING', 'IDLE', 'FAULTED'), what are the potential drawbacks of representing compressor state simply as a Boolean? How could you improve this to provide more information while maintaining backward compatibility?
