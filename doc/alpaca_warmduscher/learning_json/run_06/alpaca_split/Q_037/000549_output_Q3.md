The `myReload()` method is responsible for fetching the current heating data and updating the component's state.  It does the following:

1. **Calls `this.heatingDataService.getCurrent(false)`:** This makes a request to the `HeatingDataService` to retrieve the current heating data.  The `false` parameter likely indicates some configuration or flag for the data retrieval process (details of this aren't visible in the snippet). The `getCurrent()` method probably returns an Observable.

2. **`.subscribe((data: any) => { ... })`:** This subscribes to the Observable returned by `heatingDataService.getCurrent()`. When the data is available from the service, the provided callback function is executed.

3. **`this.heatingEntity = HeatingEntity.ofWebService(data);`:** The received data (of type `any`) is passed to the static method `HeatingEntity.ofWebService()`. This method likely converts the raw data from the service into an instance of the `HeatingEntity` class, which is a more structured and usable representation of the heating data.  The result is then assigned to the `this.heatingEntity` property, updating the component's internal state.

4. **`this.receivedNewTHValue.emit(data);`:**  As described in the previous answer, this emits an event to notify any parent components that the heating data has been updated. The original `data` (before conversion to `HeatingEntity`) is emitted.

In summary, `myReload()` is the central method for updating the component's data, fetching it from the service, transforming it into a meaningful object, and notifying other components of the change.
