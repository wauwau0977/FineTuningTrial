The `style="width: 100px; height: 50px;"` attribute directly sets the width and height of the `<highcharts-chart>` element in pixels. This attribute controls the amount of screen space allocated to rendering the gauge chart.

Effect on rendering: By explicitly setting the width and height, the gauge chart will be rendered within a 100x50 pixel area. The chart will scale its contents to fit within these dimensions. If the chart's default size is different, it will be resized accordingly, potentially affecting the readability of labels, the size of data points, or the overall visual balance of the chart.

Considerations influencing dimensions:

*   **Data Density and Readability:** If the gauge chart displays a lot of data or has complex labels, a larger area might be necessary to prevent overcrowding and ensure readability. Conversely, if the chart is simple, smaller dimensions might be sufficient.
*   **UI Layout and Responsiveness:** The dimensions should be chosen to fit well within the overall user interface layout. It's important to consider how the chart will adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. The dimensions might be defined using relative units (e.g., percentages) instead of fixed pixels to achieve responsiveness.
*   **Visual Emphasis:** The size of the chart can be used to emphasize its importance within the UI. A larger chart will naturally draw more attention.
*    **Chart Type**: Certain chart types may require specific aspect ratios to be displayed effectively. For example a pie chart might benefit from a square or nearly square aspect ratio.
*   **Accessibility**: Sufficient size ensures that the chart remains visually discernible for users with visual impairments.
