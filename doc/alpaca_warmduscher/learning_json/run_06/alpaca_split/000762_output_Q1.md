The innermost subquery (starting with `SELECT measurement_date, year1, ... FROM heat_pump h1 WHERE 1 = 1...`) is the foundation of the entire query, responsible for extracting and preparing the raw data from the `heat_pump` table. Its primary purpose is to enrich each record with several calculated fields that are then used by subsequent subqueries. Specifically, it does the following:

1.  **Extracts Year and Day of Year:** It extracts the year (`year1`) and day of the year (`doy`) from the `measurement_date`. These are used for grouping and ordering data.
2.  **Calculates Day of Week:** It determines the day of the week (`day_of_week_starting_sunday`) for each record.
3.  **Calculates Window Values:** It utilizes window functions (`FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, `MIN`, `MAX`) to calculate minimum and maximum values, first and last values of `boiler_temp` over a “window” defined by `year1`, `doy` and `hour_of_day`. This is done to create values for later calculations.
4.  **Calculates Record Count:** `count(1) over ()` calculates the total number of records.
5.  **Selects Boiler Temp:** It selects the `boiler_temp` for use in later window function calculations.

The results of this subquery are then passed to the next level up, where the window function values are used to compute differences and statistics. The purpose is to calculate metrics like the maximum decrease and increase in boiler temperature within each hour, providing data for analysis of temperature fluctuations. The overall query uses these values to calculate statistical summaries for each day of the week and hour of the day. In essence, it’s a data preparation and enrichment step that sets the stage for the more complex calculations in the outer subqueries.
