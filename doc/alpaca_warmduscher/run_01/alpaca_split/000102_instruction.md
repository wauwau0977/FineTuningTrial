You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# Boiler Chart Component - Technical Documentation

This document details the technical aspects of the `Boiler Chart` component, a front-end Angular component responsible for displaying various charts related to boiler performance data.

## 1. Overview

The `Boiler Chart` component fetches and visualizes data through multiple charts. These charts provide insight into boiler operation, efficiency, and environmental factors.  The component utilizes Highcharts for rendering the visualizations.  Data loading is asynchronous, with indicators displayed during loading.

## 2. Component Functionality

*   **Data Fetching:** The component retrieves data from a backend service (not defined within this HTML snippet, but implied).  This data is then formatted and used to configure the various Highcharts.
*   **Chart Rendering:** Highcharts are configured with appropriate data series, titles, axes, and other visual properties.
*   **Dynamic Data Updates:** Charts are updated dynamically as new data becomes available.
*   **Loading Indicators:** Visual cues (loading spinners) are displayed while data is being fetched or processed.
*   **Configuration Options:** The charts likely have configurable options, such as time ranges, data granularity, and display preferences (not directly visible in the HTML).

## 3.  Key Technologies

*   **Angular:** Front-end framework for building the component.
*   **Highcharts:** JavaScript charting library used for data visualization.
*   **HTML/CSS:** For component structure and styling.
*   **Backend Service (Implied):** A server-side component providing the data for the charts.

## 4. Component Structure (HTML Breakdown)

The HTML consists of a series of `mat-card` components. Each card encapsulates a single chart related to a specific aspect of boiler operation.

*   **`mat-card`:** A Material Design card component providing a container for the chart and its title.
*   **`mat-card-subtitle`:** Displays the title of the chart within the card.
*   **`highcharts-chart`:**  A custom Angular component wrapping the Highcharts library.  This component is responsible for initializing and configuring the Highcharts instance.
    *   `[options]="chartOptionsX"`: This attribute binds the Highcharts configuration object to the component.  `chartOptionsX` refers to Angular component properties that contain the Highcharts configuration (series, titles, axes, etc.).
    *   `[(update)]="chartUpdateFlagX"`:  Two-way data binding to a flag which triggers the update of the chart.
    *   `[callbackFunction]="operationsChartCallback"`: An optional function to execute after the chart has been rendered. Used for custom manipulations or further configuration.
*   **`mat-spinner`:** A Material Design spinner component that is displayed while the data for a specific chart is loading.

## 5. Data Displayed (Charts)

The component displays the following charts:

*   Boiler Temperature (In/Out)
*   Boiler Temperature Difference (In/Out)
*   Boiler Stats by Hour
*   Boiler Stats by Day of Week
*   Sole Temperature (In/Out)
*   Sole Temperature Difference (In/Out)
*   Sole Temperature Difference (Operating)
*   Heating Temperature (In/Out)
*   Heating Temperature Difference (In/Out)
*   Compressor Hours
*   Operation Chart
*   Outdoor Temperature
*   Wind Gusts (Meteo-Schweiz Kloten)

Each chart displays time series data, potentially with different units and scales.  Chart titles provide context for the displayed data.

## 6.  Component Properties (Inferred)

The HTML suggests the existence of several Angular component properties:

*   `chartOptionsBoilerTemp`: Configuration object for the Boiler Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsBoilerDeltaTemp`: Configuration object for the Boiler Delta Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsBoilerStatsByHour`: Configuration object for the Boiler Stats by Hour chart.
*   `chartOptionsBoilerStatsByDayOfWeek`: Configuration object for the Boiler Stats by Day of Week chart.
*   `chartOptionsSoleTemp`: Configuration object for the Sole Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsSoleDeltaTemp`: Configuration object for the Sole Delta Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsSoleDeltaTempInOperation`: Configuration object for the Sole Delta Temperature (Operating) chart.
*   `chartOptionsHeatingTemp`: Configuration object for the Heating Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsHeatingDeltaTemp`: Configuration object for the Heating Delta Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsCompressorHours`: Configuration object for the Compressor Hours chart.
*   `chartOptionsOperationsChart`: Configuration object for the Operation Chart.
*   `chartOptionsOutdoorTemperature`: Configuration object for the Outdoor Temperature chart.
*   `chartOptionsWindGustMeteo`: Configuration object for the Wind Gusts chart.
*   `chartUpdateFlagBoilerTemp`, `chartUpdateFlagBoilerDeltaTemp`, ... : Boolean flags used to trigger updates to the respective charts.
*   `loadingBoilerTemp`, `loadingBoilerDeltaTemp`, ...: Boolean flags indicating whether a chart is currently loading data.
*   `operationsChartCallback`: Function to execute after the Operation Chart is rendered.
*   `boilerStatsByHourNumberOfStaticsRecords`: Number of data points in the Boiler Stats by Hour chart.
*   `boilerStatsByDayOfWeekNumberOfStaticsRecords`: Number of data points in the Boiler Stats by Day of Week chart.

## 7.  Potential Improvements

*   **Data Loading Management:** Implement a centralized data loading mechanism to handle data fetching and error handling more efficiently.
*   **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully handle cases where data cannot be loaded.
*   **Configuration Options:** Provide a user interface for configuring the charts (e.g., time range, data granularity).
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the charts are accessible to users with disabilities.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Ensure the charts are displayed correctly on different screen sizes.

## 8. Conclusion

The `Boiler Chart` component is a complex visualization component that displays a wide range of data related to boiler operation.  The component utilizes Angular and Highcharts to provide a user-friendly and informative interface for monitoring boiler performance.
