```java
package com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.cache;
import org.springframework.cache.CacheManager;
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching;
import org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheManager;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class CachingConfig {
    @Bean
    public CacheManager cacheManager() {
        return new ConcurrentMapCacheManager("sessionDeviceCache");
    }
}
```

The `CachingConfig` class is a Spring configuration class responsible for setting up caching within the application. The `@Configuration` annotation marks it as a source of bean definitions for the Spring container. The `@EnableCaching` annotation enables Spring's caching functionality, allowing the use of `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, and `@CacheEvict` annotations in other parts of the application.

The `cacheManager` method is annotated with `@Bean`, indicating that it should create and return a bean that will be managed by the Spring container.  This method returns an instance of `ConcurrentMapCacheManager`, which is a simple in-memory cache implementation that uses a `ConcurrentMap` to store cached data.

The `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` is configured with a single cache named "sessionDeviceCache". This means that a cache with this name will be created and available for use by other parts of the application to store and retrieve data related to session devices.  The cache will reside entirely in memory and will be automatically managed by Spring.
