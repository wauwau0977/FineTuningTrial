For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' we have the following question: 

Assume the `BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek` interface is used in a system that calculates daily boiler performance metrics.  Describe a scenario where a class implementing this interface might return a `null` value for `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()` despite having valid data for the other fields (e.g., `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, `numOfStatisticRecords1`). Explain what might have caused this situation and how your implementation would handle it to prevent errors further downstream.
