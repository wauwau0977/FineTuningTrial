For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UnsafeRunnable.java' with name 'UnsafeRunnable.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnsafeRunnable {
   void run() throws Exception;
}
```
How does defining `UnsafeRunnable` as an interface contribute to the overall design principle of loose coupling, and what are the benefits of using an interface over, for example, an abstract class in this scenario?
