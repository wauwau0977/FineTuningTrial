The provided tests primarily focus on scenarios with a roughly one-year date range and varying data point counts. Several edge cases aren’t covered:

1.  **Zero Data Points:** The tests don’t cover the scenario where `dataPoints` is zero. The method’s behavior in this case is unknown and could lead to division by zero or an infinite loop if not handled correctly.
2.  **Very Short Date Ranges:** The tests all use date ranges of at least 7 days. A very short date range (e.g., a single day) combined with a large number of data points might cause unexpected behavior or return an inappropriate interval.
3.  **Very Large Date Ranges:** While a one-year range is tested, extremely large date ranges (e.g., several years) combined with a moderate number of data points could cause issues. The algorithm might not scale well and could return overly coarse intervals.
4.  **Data Point Counts Near Thresholds:** The tests seem to focus on values that lead directly to "1d", "1h", "4h", "3d". Testing values *very close* to these thresholds (e.g. 164, 166, 359, 361) would be important to check boundary conditions and prevent off-by-one errors.
5.  **Negative Data Points:** Although unlikely, the method should be robust enough to handle negative input values for `dataPoints`. This would reveal whether any input validation is performed.
6.  **Invalid Dates:** The tests assume valid date ranges. Testing with invalid dates (e.g., future dates, dates out of range) could uncover potential errors.
7.  **Floating Point Precision:** Though not directly visible in the tests, internal calculations might involve floating-point arithmetic. Large date ranges combined with numerous data points could potentially lead to precision errors.
