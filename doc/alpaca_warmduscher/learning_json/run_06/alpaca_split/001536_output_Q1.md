While `UUID.equals()` is the correct way to compare `UUID` objects, asserting string equality provides an extra layer of confidence, particularly when dealing with custom implementations or conversions.

`UUID.equals()` checks if the underlying long values representing the UUID are equal. However, there's a potential for subtle errors in how a custom conversion (like `toShortText` and `fromShortText`) handles string representation. The string representation might be subtly incorrect even if the underlying long values are correct.

By also asserting that the string representations of the original and converted UUIDs are equal, the test verifies that the entire process—conversion to a short text representation and back to a UUID—is lossless, including the formatting and representation of the UUID. It ensures consistency in how the UUID is represented at both the object and string levels.  It's a more thorough validation of the conversion process.
