The primary issue is that `response.getStatus()` is likely being set *within* Spring's framework after the actual request handling is complete, but *before* `afterCompletion` is invoked. Therefore, the time taken to set the HTTP status code is included in `dtProcessing`, skewing the measurement of the application’s processing time. This leads to an overestimation of how long the application code took to handle the request.

Mitigation strategies:

1. **Store Status Code Earlier:** Ideally, the framework should allow access to the status code *before* it's fully committed. If possible, capture the status code within the request handling logic itself (e.g., in a controller) and store it as a request attribute *before* `afterCompletion` is called.

2. **Use a Request Attribute:** If capturing the status code within the handler is not feasible, consider using a request attribute set *before* the response is written. The controller could set `request.setAttribute("th.status", response.getStatus());` before returning, then `afterCompletion` could use that value.

3. **More Granular Timestamps:** Add timestamps at various stages *within* the request handling logic (e.g., after database calls, after business logic execution).  This allows for finer-grained analysis of where time is spent and reduces the impact of framework overhead included in `dtProcessing`.

4. **Accept Imprecision:** Recognize that obtaining *perfect* accuracy in a production environment is difficult and potentially costly. A reasonable margin of error might be acceptable. In such cases, the existing implementation is acceptable, but it’s crucial to document the potential skew.

A robust solution would likely combine approaches 2 and 3. Capture the status code in the controller and add additional timestamps within the core logic to provide a comprehensive view of performance.
