For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/MailSend.java' with name 'MailSend.java' we have the following question: 

The `send` method (with three parameters: `String subject`, `String content`, `String receiverMails`) is responsible for sending an email. Describe in detail how this method establishes a connection to the SMTP server, authenticates, constructs the email message, and ultimately sends it. Include details about the properties used for the connection, the authentication mechanism, and the error handling in place.  Focus on explaining the steps involved from the creation of the `Properties` object to the call of `Transport.send(message)`.
