You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code represents the main HTML template for the 'Warmduscher' application's root component. It primarily functions as a container for displaying different application views based on routing. It includes a router outlet for dynamic content, and a fixed footer navigation bar with links to the Dashboard, Insights (Charts), and About sections of the application.  It uses Angular Material components for styling and UI elements.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.html
- **Class Name(s):** AppComponent (inferred from the surrounding Angular project)

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Displaying the application's content based on the current route, providing a consistent footer navigation.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  The code does not directly handle user input. It *displays* output based on the application's logic and routing. User interaction with the buttons in the footer triggers route changes.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `<router-outlet>` directive renders the component associated with the current route.
    2. The footer remains persistently displayed, providing navigation links.
    3. Clicking a footer button updates the route, causing the `<router-outlet>` to display the corresponding component.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Routing:**  Relies on Angular's Router module to handle navigation between different application views.  The `routerLink` directives trigger route changes.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** The code doesn't have specific error handling within the HTML. Error handling would be implemented in the components loaded within the `<router-outlet>`.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The template itself is lightweight and should render quickly.  Performance will largely depend on the components loaded into the `<router-outlet>`.
- **Scalability:** The template itself doesn't directly impact scalability.
- **Security:** The template does not handle any sensitive data and doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities directly.  Security concerns would reside in the application logic and data handling within the routed components.
- **Maintainability:**  The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. Using Angular Material components improves maintainability by providing a consistent look and feel.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The template itself is static and reliable.  Reliability of the application depends on the underlying components and services.
- **Usability:** Provides a clear and consistent navigation experience via the footer.
- **Compliance:**  Compliant with Angular and HTML standards.

## 5. Key Components

- **`<router-outlet>`:**  A directive that dynamically renders the component associated with the current route.
- **`<mat-toolbar>` & `<mat-toolbar-row>`:** Angular Material components for creating a toolbar, which in this case serves as the footer.
- **`<button mat-flat-button>`:** Angular Material button component for navigation.
- **`<mat-icon>`:**  Angular Material icon component for displaying icons.
- **`routerLink` & `routerLinkActive`:** Angular directives for handling navigation and highlighting the active route.
- **CSS Classes:** `myContent`, `myLastSpace`, `toolbarNav`, `toolbarText`, and `active-link` provide styling.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- HTML5
- CSS3

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular:**  Used for building the application's UI and handling routing.
- **Angular Material:**  Provides UI components (toolbar, buttons, icons) and styling.
- **Router:** The Angular Router is used for navigation between different application views.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly identified in the code snippet. The project likely has other internal modules and services used by the components loaded into the `<router-outlet>`.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Accessibility:** Ensure all UI elements are accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- **Theming:** Implement a more robust theming solution to allow users to customize the application's appearance.
- **Responsiveness:** While likely handled by Angular Material's responsive grid system, it's important to thoroughly test the application on different screen sizes and devices.
- **Code Splitting:** Consider code splitting to reduce the initial load time of the application.
- **Componentization:** While the template itself is simple, ensure that the components loaded into the `<router-outlet>` are well-structured and reusable.
