For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/.mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java' with name 'MavenWrapperDownloader.java'... 
The code creates a file path using `File(baseDirectory, MAVEN_WRAPPER_PROPERTIES_PATH)`. What potential issues could arise from directly concatenating strings to form file paths, and how could the code be improved to handle these issues more robustly?
