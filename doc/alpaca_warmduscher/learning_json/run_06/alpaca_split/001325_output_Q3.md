The comment explicitly warns against adding the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation. It states that doing so will "override and destroy the application properties settings." This is because `@EnableWebMvc` triggers Spring's default MVC configuration, which can conflict with the application-specific settings defined in `application.properties` or `application.yml`. Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring MVC, and `@EnableWebMvc` disables this auto-configuration, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of functionality. The auto-configuration is designed to work seamlessly with the application's properties, while `@EnableWebMvc` forces a default configuration that might not respect those properties.
