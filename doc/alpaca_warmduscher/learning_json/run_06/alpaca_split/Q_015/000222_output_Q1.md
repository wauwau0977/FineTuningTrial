`HttpParams` is an Angular class designed for constructing HTTP request parameters. It provides a safe and convenient way to append key-value pairs to a URL without manually constructing the query string.  Instead of concatenating strings, you use methods like `.set()` to add parameters, and Angular handles the correct encoding and formatting of the query string.

The main advantages of using `HttpParams` over manually constructing query strings are:

1.  **Encoding:** `HttpParams` automatically handles URL encoding of parameter values, which is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.  Manually encoding is error-prone.
2.  **Readability & Maintainability:** Using `.set()` and other methods makes the code more readable and easier to maintain than manually concatenating strings.
3.  **Type Safety:** While not strictly typed, using the `HttpParams` API reduces the risk of typos and errors compared to manually constructing strings.

**Security Implications of Manual Query String Construction:**

Manually constructing query strings can introduce several security vulnerabilities:

1.  **Injection Attacks:** If you don't properly encode user-provided data before including it in the query string, attackers could inject malicious code or modify the request's behavior.  For example, an attacker could inject special characters to alter the query or inject JavaScript code.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the server-side code doesn't properly sanitize the query string parameters, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
3.  **URL Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the URL to bypass security checks or access unauthorized resources.

`HttpParams` significantly mitigates these risks by automatically handling encoding and preventing the inclusion of malicious characters. It enforces a safer way to construct HTTP requests.
