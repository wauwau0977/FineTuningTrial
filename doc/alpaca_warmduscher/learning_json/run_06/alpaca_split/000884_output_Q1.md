The inclusion of both regular and min/max getter methods suggests the interface is likely supporting queries or reporting that require both current values and historical ranges. This could be for several reasons:

*   **Trend Analysis:** Clients might want to calculate the range of a value over a specific period (e.g., daily, weekly) to identify trends or anomalies.
*   **Alerting/Thresholds:** The min/max values could be used to define acceptable ranges for certain parameters. If a current value falls outside the min/max, an alert can be triggered.
*   **Data Visualization:** Charts and dashboards might display both the current value and the historical range to provide context.

The implications are:

*   **Data Storage:** It implies that the implementing classes are storing both current values *and* the minimum and maximum observed values for each parameter.
*   **Update Logic:**  Implementing classes will need logic to update the min/max values whenever a new measurement is received. This could involve comparing the new value with the existing min/max and updating them accordingly.
*   **Potential Redundancy:**  If the min/max values are rarely used, it might represent unnecessary storage and update overhead.
