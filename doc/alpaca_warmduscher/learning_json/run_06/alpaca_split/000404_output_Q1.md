Having multiple series for outdoor temperature (sensor and Meteo-Schweiz data) can create visual clutter and make it difficult to interpret the data accurately. Overlapping data points can obscure trends and make it hard to distinguish between the different data sources.

The configuration attempts to mitigate these issues in a few ways:

1.  **Different Colors:** Each series is assigned a distinct color ('#2596be', '#518663', '#8c4522'), allowing for visual differentiation.
2.  **Series Names:** Each series has a descriptive name, which is displayed in the legend, helping users understand the source of each line.
3.  **Legend Enabled:** The legend is enabled, providing a key for interpreting the different series.
4.  **Line Styles (potentially):** Although not explicitly set, differing line widths are used, offering a slightly different visual weight.
5. **`minRange: 20`**: This setting on the yAxis helps ensure that even if data becomes very close, the chart doesn't collapse or become unreadable.

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these mitigations depends on the degree of overlap and the user's ability to distinguish between the colors and line styles.
