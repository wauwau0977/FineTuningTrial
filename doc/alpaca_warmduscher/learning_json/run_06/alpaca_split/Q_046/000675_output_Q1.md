A `TreeMap` is used instead of a `HashMap` because a `TreeMap` maintains its keys in a sorted order. In this specific scenario, itâ€™s used to store `detailInfo` which contains information about the application's startup process.

The benefits of using a `TreeMap` in this context are:

*   **Consistent Logging Order:**  When the `detailInfo` map is serialized to JSON (using `Utils.toJSON`), the keys will always be in the same sorted order. This ensures consistency in the audit logs, making them easier to read and compare over time.
*   **Readability:**  The sorted order improves the readability of the logs. Developers and administrators can easily find specific information within the log message.
*   **Debugging and Analysis:** When debugging or analyzing startup issues, the sorted order can help quickly identify any missing or unexpected data in the logs.

While a `HashMap` would provide faster lookups (although performance is likely negligible in this context), the consistent and predictable ordering provided by `TreeMap` is more valuable for logging and auditing purposes. It aids in maintainability and provides better insights into the application's startup process. Essentially, it improves the *human readability* of the logs, which is often more important than pure performance in logging scenarios.
