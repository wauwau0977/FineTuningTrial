For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/audit/AuditLogRepository.java' with name 'AuditLogRepository.java'... 
Considering that the repository extends `CrudRepository<AuditLogEntity, String>`, how would you perform a query to retrieve all audit logs with a specific `message` field value (assuming `AuditLogEntity` has a `message` field)?  Explain what you would *add* to this interface to achieve that.
