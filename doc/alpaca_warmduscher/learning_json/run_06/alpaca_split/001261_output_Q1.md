A scenario could be to integrate with a monitoring system during startup. We could extend this listener to send information about the application's startup status, version, environment, and the startup time taken to a monitoring service like Prometheus, Datadog, or New Relic. The `ready()` method could be extended to make an API call to the monitoring service with the collected data.  Another extension could be to perform a health check on external dependencies (databases, message queues) during startup. If any dependency fails the health check, the listener could log an error and potentially prevent the application from starting, providing an early indication of a critical failure. This proactively alerts the operations team before users are impacted.
