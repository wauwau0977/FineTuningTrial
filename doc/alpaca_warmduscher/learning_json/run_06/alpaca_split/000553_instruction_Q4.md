For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Explain the purpose and function of the `subscribe` line of code directly after the definition of the `gaugeChartOptions` property. What does the interval value signify, what does the callback function do, and what are the implications of assigning the result of the `interval` call to the `subscribe` variable?
