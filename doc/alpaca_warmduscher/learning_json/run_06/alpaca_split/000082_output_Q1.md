This module, `AppRoutingModule`, is responsible for configuring the application's routing. It imports the `RouterModule` and `Routes` from `@angular/router` and defines an empty array of routes. The `@NgModule` decorator configures the module to import `RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` which initializes the root router with these routes and exports the `RouterModule` for use throughout the application. 

Currently, this module provides *no* actual routing functionality. The `routes` array is empty, meaning all routes will resolve to the default Angular route, likely the root component.  This means the application will only display the initial component and any attempt to navigate to other URLs will fail or behave unpredictably.

Potential issues:

*   **Broken Navigation:** Any attempt to navigate using the router will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **Single Page Application Limitation:** The application won't function as a true SPA, as it won’t be able to dynamically load different components based on URL changes.
*   **User Experience:** Users won’t be able to navigate between different features or views without a full page reload (if any navigation is even implemented elsewhere).

To address these issues, I would populate the `routes` array with route definitions. Each route definition would specify a path and the component to display when that path is navigated to. For example:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' } // Redirect to home if no path is specified
];
```
