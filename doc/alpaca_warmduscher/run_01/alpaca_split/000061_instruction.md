You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class `MeteoDataServiceImpl` is responsible for fetching weather data (temperature, sunshine duration, and wind gust speed) from the MeteoSwiss service. It retrieves data for a list of configured station IDs, parses the JSON response, and converts it into a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects. The service is disabled when the `SENSOR_MOCK` profile is active.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataServiceImpl.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoDataServiceImpl`, `ResDateValue`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Fetch weather data from MeteoSwiss for configured station IDs.
    - Parse the JSON response from the MeteoSwiss service.
    - Convert the parsed data into a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**:
        - Configuration properties defining the base URLs for temperature, sunshine, and wind gust data.
        - List of station IDs to retrieve data for.
    - **Outputs**:
        - A list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects, each containing weather data for a specific station.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  Initialize the JSON parsing configuration.
    2.  For each station ID in the configured list:
        1.  Call the MeteoSwiss service for temperature, sunshine, and wind gust data.
        2.  Parse the JSON response using JsonPath.
        3.  Extract the relevant data (value, timestamp, station name) for each weather parameter.
        4.  Create a `MeteoSwissEntity` object and populate it with the extracted data.
    3.  Return the list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **HTTP GET Requests**:  The code performs HTTP GET requests to the MeteoSwiss API endpoints (defined by the configuration properties).
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **API Unavailability**: The code does not explicitly handle API unavailability. A network error or timeout during the HTTP request would result in an exception.
    - **Invalid JSON**: If the JSON response from the MeteoSwiss service is invalid, the JsonPath parsing will likely throw an exception.
    - **Missing Data**:  If the JSON response doesn't contain data for a specific station or parameter, the JsonPath expression will return null or an empty list, leading to an exception if not handled.
    - **Configuration Errors**: Missing or invalid configuration properties (URLs, station IDs) will cause issues during initialization or data retrieval.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The code should retrieve and process data for all configured stations within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds).  The logging includes timing measurements to track performance.
- **Scalability**: The code is not designed for high scalability.  It relies on synchronous HTTP requests and in-memory processing.  For a larger number of stations, asynchronous processing and caching might be required.
- **Security**: The code does not explicitly address security concerns. Sensitive data (if any) should be handled securely in the communication with the MeteoSwiss API.
- **Maintainability**: The code is generally well-structured and uses dependency injection (Spring).  The use of descriptive variable names and comments enhances readability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The reliability depends on the availability of the MeteoSwiss service and network connectivity. The code doesn't have built-in fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Usability**: The code is intended to be integrated into a larger system. Its usability depends on the clarity of the API and documentation.
- **Compliance**: N/A

## 5. Key Components

- **`MeteoDataServiceImpl`**: The main class responsible for fetching and processing MeteoSwiss data.
    - `getData()`: Fetches data for all configured stations and returns a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects.
    - `callService(String url)`: Makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and returns the response as a string.
    - `extractFromJSON(String json, String stationId, String value2Property)`: Parses the JSON response using JsonPath and extracts the relevant data for a specific station.
    - `init()`: Initializes the JsonPath configuration.
- **`ResDateValue`**: A data class that encapsulates the extracted data (timestamp, value, station name).
- **Error Handling**:  Error handling is limited. Exceptions might be thrown if the API is unavailable, the JSON is invalid, or data is missing.
- **Classes**: `ResDateValue` is a nested static class within `MeteoDataServiceImpl`.
- **Modules**: The code is part of the `thserver` module in the `Warmduscher` project.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures (Lists, Maps, Dates).
- String manipulation.
- HTTP client functionality (via Spring's `RestTemplate`).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection, configuration, and HTTP client (`RestTemplate`).
- **JsonPath**: Used for parsing JSON responses and extracting data. (Jayway JsonPath library)
- **Lombok**: Used for generating boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- N/A

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling to gracefully handle API unavailability, invalid JSON responses, and missing data.  Use try-catch blocks and log errors appropriately.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous processing (e.g., Spring's `@Async` annotation or reactive programming) to fetch data for multiple stations concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
- **Caching**: Implement caching (e.g., using Spring's `@Cacheable` annotation) to store frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the MeteoSwiss API and improving performance.
- **Configuration Management**: Use a more robust configuration management mechanism (e.g., Spring Cloud Config) to manage configuration properties in a centralized and dynamic manner.
- **Logging**: Enhance logging with more detailed information, including request/response headers, timestamps, and error messages.
- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the code, including data retrieval, parsing, and error handling.
- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation to ensure that the extracted data is valid and consistent.
- **Monitoring**: Add monitoring metrics to track the performance and health of the service.
- **Security**: Consider implementing security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
