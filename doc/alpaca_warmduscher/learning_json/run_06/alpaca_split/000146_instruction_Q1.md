For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.ts' with name 'app.component.ts'...
This component seems to be responsible for the application's main layout and potentially other global functionalities.  How could you refactor this component to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle? What specific parts could be extracted into separate components or services?
