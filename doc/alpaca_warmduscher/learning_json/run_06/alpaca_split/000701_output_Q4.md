The polling interval for the `pollData` method is configured using the `@Scheduled` annotation. Specifically, the `fixedDelayString` parameter of the annotation is bound to the `thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval` property.

`@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval:PT900s}", initialDelay = 0)`

This configuration leverages Spring's property placeholder mechanism.  If the `thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval` property is defined in the application's configuration (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`), its value will be used as the fixed delay between successive executions of the `pollData` method.  The value should be expressed in ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., `PT1H` for one hour, `PT30m` for 30 minutes).

**Default Behavior:**

If the `thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval` property is *not* defined, the expression `${thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval:PT900s}` falls back to the default value of `PT900s`. This means that if the property is missing, the `pollData` method will be executed every 900 seconds (15 minutes).

**Impact on Frequency:**

The polling interval directly impacts the frequency of data retrieval. A shorter interval results in more frequent updates, potentially providing more real-time data but increasing the load on the external data source and database. A longer interval reduces the load but may result in less timely data.  The default value of 15 minutes provides a reasonable balance between data freshness and resource utilization.
