The conditional logic in `generateShortTextUUID()` addresses the fact that the Base58 encoding of a randomly generated UUID *can* sometimes result in a string shorter than the expected 22 characters. This isn't a guaranteed occurrence, but it's possible due to the nature of the encoding and the distribution of values in the UUID.

Simply padding the short text with standard Base58 characters wouldn’t be sufficient because it might not maintain the “safe” character constraint of the encoding, or introduce unintended biases. The goal is a *fixed-length* string with predictable characteristics. If we just appended arbitrary Base58 characters, the resulting string might not adhere to the project's requirements of avoiding ambiguous characters and a consistent string format.

By appending characters *from another generated UUID*, the code ensures that only valid, "safe" Base58 characters are used for padding, and maintains consistency in the overall character set. This approach also provides a degree of randomness to the generated string, while still fulfilling the fixed-length requirement.
