You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a JPA entity class `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` representing statistical data from MeteoSwiss weather stations.  It stores information like temperature, wind speed, and their minimum/maximum values, along with corresponding measurement dates. The entity is designed to be immutable, likely for use in read-only data access scenarios.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:  Represents a record of MeteoSwiss weather statistics.  Primarily serves as a data holder for database persistence.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: The class does not directly handle user input or output. Data is expected to be populated via database interactions or other service layers. Output is achieved via getter methods for accessing the stored data.
- **Workflow/Logic**:  The class primarily defines data fields and corresponding getter/setter methods.  The `setId()` method generates a UUID upon instantiation.  The core logic resides in the data access layer that populates and retrieves these entities.
- **External Interactions**: This class interacts with the database through JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **Edge Cases Handling**: No specific edge case handling within the class itself.  The persistence layer is responsible for handling potential database errors.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  Minimal performance impact as it's a simple data holder.  Efficiency depends on the database query performance.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability is dependent on the database and persistence layer. The entity itself does not pose a direct scalability concern.
- **Security**: No direct security concerns within this class. Data security is handled by the overall application and database security measures.
- **Maintainability**: Relatively easy to maintain due to its simplicity.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Reliability depends on the database and persistence layer.
- **Usability**:  Easy to understand and integrate into a JPA-based application.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are apparent from the code itself.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `getId()`: Returns the UUID of the entity.
    - `setId()`: Sets the UUID of the entity.  Generates a UUID if one is not provided.
    - `getStationId()`: Returns the ID of the weather station.
    - `setStationId()`: Sets the ID of the weather station.
    - `getStationName()`: Returns the name of the weather station.
    - `setStationName()`: Sets the name of the weather station.
    - `getTemperature()`: Returns the temperature measurement.
    - `setTemperature()`: Sets the temperature measurement.
    - Similar getter/setter methods exist for `temperatureMin`, `temperatureMax`, `temperatureMeasureDate`, `windGustSpeed`, and `windMeasureDate`.
- **Important logic flows**: The core logic is to simply store and retrieve data. The `setId()` method uses a utility to generate the UUID.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling within the class.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is a standard JPA entity and part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures: Primarily uses primitive data types (Double, Date, String) and objects.
- Date and Time API: Uses `java.util.Date` for handling dates.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Used for database persistence.
- **Hibernate Annotations**: `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@Immutable` are Hibernate-specific annotations.
- **UUIDUtils**: Likely a custom utility class used to generate UUIDs.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.UUIDUtils`: Used to generate the unique ID for the entity.



## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**: No significant performance concerns within the entity itself. Database indexing and query optimization will have a greater impact.
- **Code Readability**: The class is already quite readable due to its simplicity.
- **Security Improvements**:  No direct security issues but ensure the database is properly secured.
- **Scalability Considerations**: The `@Immutable` annotation is good for read-heavy scenarios and can improve concurrency. Consider using a more robust date/time API (like `java.time`) for better date handling and thread safety.  Consider adding more detailed validation logic within the persistence layer.
