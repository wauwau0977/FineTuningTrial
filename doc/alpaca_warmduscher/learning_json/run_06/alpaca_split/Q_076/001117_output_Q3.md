The `try-catch` block is used to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the email sending process. Specifically, it catches `MessagingException`, which is a checked exception thrown by the Java Mail API (javax.mail) when there are issues with sending the email, such as network problems, invalid email addresses, or authentication failures.

If a `MessagingException` occurs within the `try` block (during the creation of the message, setting recipients, setting the subject/content, or sending the message), the `catch` block is executed. Inside the `catch` block, a new `RuntimeException` is created. This `RuntimeException` wraps the original `MessagingException` as its cause, providing more context about the error. The `RuntimeException` has a custom message indicating the failure to send the email to the specified `receiverMails`.

Additionally, the error is logged using the `log.error` method, which writes the error message and the stack trace to the application's log files. Finally, the `RuntimeException` is re-thrown, which will propagate the error up the call stack, potentially causing the application to fail or be handled by a higher-level error handling mechanism. This ensures that failures in sending emails are properly reported and handled, preventing silent failures and providing valuable debugging information.
