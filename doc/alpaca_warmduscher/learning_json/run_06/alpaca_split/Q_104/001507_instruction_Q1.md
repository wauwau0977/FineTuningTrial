For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java' with name 'Base58BitcoinFlavorTest.java'... 
The `checkString` method generates random byte arrays and then encodes/decodes them using the `Base58BitcoinFlavor` class. What is the primary purpose of asserting that the `shortString` (the encoded string) does *not* contain certain characters (`,`, `.`, `>`, `'`, `"`)? What potential issues would the presence of these characters in the encoded string cause?
