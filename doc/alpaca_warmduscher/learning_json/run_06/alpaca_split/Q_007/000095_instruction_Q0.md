You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component (`app.component.html`) serves as the main layout and navigation for the 'Warmduscher' web application. It primarily renders a `router-outlet` to display different application views based on routing, and provides a fixed footer with navigation buttons to key sections: Dashboard, Insights (Charts), and About.  It utilizes Angular Material components for a consistent user interface.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.html`
- **Class Name(s):**  While this is an HTML file, it interacts with the `AppComponent` class in the corresponding `.ts` file. It utilizes Angular Material components like `<mat-toolbar>`, `<mat-toolbar-row>`, `<button>`, `<mat-icon>`, and `<router-outlet>`.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Display the currently active application view based on the Angular router.
    - Render a fixed footer with navigation buttons.
    - Handle navigation to different sections of the application.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**  Navigation clicks on the footer buttons.  The Angular router handles these interactions.
    - **Outputs:** Display of different application views in the `router-outlet`. Visual display of the footer with buttons.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `router-outlet` displays the component associated with the current route.
    2. The footer is always rendered.
    3. When a user clicks a button in the footer, the Angular router updates the URL, triggering the display of a new component in the `router-outlet`.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Angular Router:** Heavily reliant on the Angular Router for navigation and view rendering.  The `routerLink` directives on the buttons handle routing.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - No specific edge case handling is directly implemented within the HTML. Edge cases will be handled in the components routed to by the `routerLink` directives. If a route is invalid, the Angular router should handle displaying an error page or a 404 error.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The component itself is lightweight and should render quickly. Performance is largely dependent on the components rendered within the `router-outlet`.
- **Scalability:** The component is scalable as the layout is consistent and adding more routes/components should not impact its performance.
- **Security:** No direct security concerns within the HTML itself. Security relies on the underlying application and the components displayed.
- **Maintainability:** The component is relatively simple and easy to maintain. The use of Angular Material components promotes consistency.
- **Reliability & Availability:** High, as it's a core layout component.  Availability is dependent on the entire application.
- **Usability:** The fixed footer provides easy access to core sections of the application, enhancing usability.
- **Compliance:**  Adheres to accessibility guidelines if Angular Material components are correctly configured and used.

## 5. Key Components

- **`<router-outlet>`:** The main content area where Angular components are dynamically rendered based on the current route.
- **`<mat-toolbar>` / `<mat-toolbar-row>`:** Provides the structure for the footer navigation bar.
- **`<button>` with `routerLink`:**  Navigation buttons that trigger routing to different sections of the application.
- **`<mat-icon>`:** Displays icons for visual clarity.
- **CSS Classes (`myContent`, `myLastSpace`, `toolbarNav`, `toolbarText`, `active-link`):** Styling classes used to control the layout and appearance of the component.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- HTML5
- CSS3

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular:** The core framework for building the application.
- **Angular Material:**  Provides UI components (toolbar, buttons, icons) for a consistent look and feel.
- **Angular Router:** For handling navigation and routing between application sections.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- No specific internal project dependencies are apparent from this HTML file alone.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** While unlikely to be a bottleneck, consider lazy loading of components rendered within the `router-outlet` to improve initial load time, especially if those components are large or complex.
- **Code Readability:** The HTML is already quite readable.  Consider using more descriptive CSS class names.
- **Security Improvements:**  Ensure Angular Material components are kept up-to-date to address any potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  The layout is already scalable.  Focus scalability efforts on the components rendered within the `router-outlet`.
- **Accessibility:** Thoroughly test the accessibility of the footer navigation and ensure appropriate ARIA attributes are used for screen readers.
