```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    AuditLogEntity that = (AuditLogEntity) o;
    return id != null ? id.equals(that.id) : that.id == null;
}
```
The `equals()` method is overridden to define equality between `AuditLogEntity` objects.  It is crucial for scenarios where comparing objects based on their identity (memory address) is insufficient, such as when comparing entities retrieved from a database.

The implementation first checks for trivial cases: if the objects are the same instance (`this == o`), it returns `true`. If the passed object `o` is null or is not of the same class (`AuditLogEntity`), it returns `false`.

The core comparison logic focuses on the `id` field. It returns `true` if both `id` fields are equal (using the `equals()` method for String comparison), and `false` otherwise. It handles the case where `id` might be null by returning `true` if both `id`s are null.

The `id` is chosen as the basis for equality because it's assumed to be a unique identifier for each audit log entry.  Comparing based on the `id` ensures that two objects are considered equal if they represent the same log entry, regardless of other potentially mutable fields.
