The use of `::ng-deep` is generally discouraged in modern Angular applications. It disables view encapsulation, allowing styles defined within this selector to leak out and affect styles in parent components, or conversely, be overridden by parent component styles. This creates tight coupling and makes the application harder to maintain and refactor. It also makes it harder to reason about styling, since you need to consider styles from all parts of the application.

Alternatives:

1.  **Component-Specific Styles:** The preferred approach is to move the styling directly into the component's stylesheet (about.component.scss or similar). This ensures that the styles are scoped to the component and don't affect other parts of the application.  You might need to adjust the HTML structure to be able to directly target the element.

2.  **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** Define a CSS variable in a parent component or globally, then use that variable to control the margin. This provides a more controlled and maintainable way to manage styling across components.

3.  **@Host Binding:**  If the element being styled is a direct child of the component's host element, you can use `@HostBinding` to apply styles directly to the host element.

4.  **Shared Styles (with caution):** If the style *really* needs to be shared across multiple components, you can create a shared styles file (e.g., `_shared.scss`) and import it into multiple component stylesheets. However, be careful to avoid namespace conflicts and ensure that the shared styles are well-documented. This is still preferable to `::ng-deep`.

In this specific case, assuming `.myInfoTitle` is within the component's template, the best solution would be to remove `::ng-deep` and style `.myInfoTitle` directly in the component's stylesheet.
