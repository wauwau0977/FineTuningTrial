The purpose of these assertions is to verify that the `getSignedNumber` method correctly handles positive integer values within the standard positive range.  They confirm that the method doesn't introduce any unexpected behavior or errors for basic, positive integer inputs.

They are necessary in a unit test because they establish a baseline of expected behavior.  Before testing edge cases (like large numbers or numbers near the boundaries of the integer range), it's important to confirm that the method functions correctly for simple, typical inputs. Without these basic tests, it’s impossible to know if any failures in later tests are due to a fundamental flaw in the method’s logic or just a problem with handling specific edge cases.

These assertions confirm that for positive integers, the `getSignedNumber` method effectively returns the input value unchanged. This implies that the method either directly returns the value if it's within the expected positive range or that any internal calculations are correctly preserving the value when it's positive.
