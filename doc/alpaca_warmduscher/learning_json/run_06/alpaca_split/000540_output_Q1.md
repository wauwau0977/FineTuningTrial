These lines are crucial for extending the base Highcharts library with specific functionalities and styling needed for this component. `highchartsMore(Highcharts)` imports additional chart types and features beyond the standard Highcharts offering. `solidGauge(Highcharts)` specifically loads the module required for creating solid gauge charts, which is the chart type used in this component. `theme(Highcharts)` applies a pre-defined visual theme (dark-unica in this case) to the chart, controlling its appearance (colors, fonts, etc.).

Without these lines, the component would likely throw errors because the `solid-gauge` module wouldnâ€™t be available, preventing the gauge chart from rendering correctly. The theme would also not be applied, resulting in a default, potentially less visually appealing, chart. Essentially, they configure Highcharts to support the specific chart type and appearance required by this component.
