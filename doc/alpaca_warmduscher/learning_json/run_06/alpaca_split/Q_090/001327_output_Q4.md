The `MvcConfig` class serves as a configuration class for Spring MVC, allowing customization of web application behavior via interceptors. 

It achieves this by implementing the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface, which necessitates the overriding of the `addInterceptors` method. Within `addInterceptors`, a custom interceptor, `MyRequestInterceptor`, is registered with the `InterceptorRegistry`. This interceptor will then be executed before and after each incoming request to the application, allowing for request processing, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns.

Dependency injection is employed through the constructor. The `SessionRequestRepository` is injected into the `MvcConfig` class via its constructor. This allows the `MyRequestInterceptor` (which is instantiated within `addInterceptors`) to access and utilize the repository for operations such as session request management or data access. This promotes loose coupling and testability.

The comment "// Attention: DO NOT ADD..." is crucial. Adding `@EnableWebMvc` would trigger Spring Boot's auto-configuration for Spring MVC, *overriding* any custom settings defined in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.  This is undesirable because the class aims to *supplement*, not replace, the default Spring Boot configuration. The intention is to add specific interceptor behavior without disrupting the established application properties.
