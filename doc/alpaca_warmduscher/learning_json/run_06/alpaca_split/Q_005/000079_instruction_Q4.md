For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/test.ts' with name 'test.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe how the `require.context` call in `test.ts` might behave if the regex was changed to `/\.ts$/`. What would be the implications of this change for the testing process, specifically relating to the execution of tests and potential errors?
