The design pattern being implemented is the **Getter/Setter (or Property Accessor)** pattern. This pattern provides controlled access to the object's attributes (fields).

Benefits in this context:

*   **Encapsulation:** It hides the internal implementation details of the class and protects the data from direct access. This allows you to change the internal representation of the data without affecting the client code that uses the class.
*   **Control Access:**  You can add logic to the getter or setter methods to validate data, perform calculations, or trigger other actions.  For example, you could validate the `deviceName` to ensure it meets certain criteria.
*   **Flexibility:**  It allows you to easily add or remove attributes without breaking existing code.
*   **Maintainability:**  Encapsulation makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
*   **Framework Compatibility:**  Many frameworks (like Spring) rely on getter/setter methods for dependency injection and data binding. The `@Value` annotation depends on the setters to inject the values.
