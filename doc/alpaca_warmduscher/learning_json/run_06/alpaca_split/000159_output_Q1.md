`LocationStrategy` in Angular routing determines how the browser's URL is used to navigate through the application.  Angular's default `PathLocationStrategy` uses the browser's history API to create clean URLs without the hash symbol (#). However, this requires server-side configuration to handle all routes and return the `index.html` file for any unknown route. 

`HashLocationStrategy` instead uses the hash portion of the URL (e.g., `/#/dashboard`) to handle navigation.  This avoids the need for server-side configuration because the server simply serves the `index.html` file, and Angular handles the routing based on the hash.

The choice of `HashLocationStrategy` suggests the developers may not have control over the server configuration, or they wanted a simpler deployment solution that avoids the need for server-side routing rules.

The implication is that the application's URLs will all include a hash symbol (#) before the route path.  This can affect SEO and user experience, but it offers a straightforward solution for handling routing without server-side changes.
