The `position: fixed` property removes the `.toolbarNav` element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to the viewport (the browser window). This means the toolbar will stay in the same position even when the user scrolls the page.  `bottom: 0` then anchors the bottom edge of the `.toolbarNav` element to the bottom edge of the viewport, ensuring it appears at the bottom of the screen. Combined with `z-index: 1000`, this effectively creates a fixed toolbar that remains visible regardless of scrolling or other content appearing on the page, and is rendered on top of other elements if necessary. The `justify-content: space-around` and other styles then distribute the toolbarâ€™s buttons and content evenly across its width.
