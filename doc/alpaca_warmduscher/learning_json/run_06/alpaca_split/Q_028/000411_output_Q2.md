The `zones` property within the `chartOptionsHeatingDeltaTemp` configuration is used to dynamically change the color of the area under the line based on the data value. It creates a visual distinction based on whether the temperature difference (`heatingTempDelta`) is above or below zero.

Specifically:

*   **`value: 0`:**  This defines a threshold. Any data point with a value less than or equal to 0 will be colored `#2596be` (a blue-ish color).
*   **`color: '#be3c25'`:** Any data point with a value greater than 0 will be colored `#be3c25` (a reddish color).

Therefore, the chart visually distinguishes between temperature differences that are negative (blue) and positive (red). This highlights whether the heating system is providing enough heat (positive difference, red) or if the temperature is dropping (negative difference, blue). It is a clear visual indicator of the systemâ€™s heating performance.  Without this, all the data would be one color.
