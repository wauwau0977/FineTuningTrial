This implementation signifies that the mock service does *not* support the functionality of scanning all registers.  It's a stubbed-out method that fulfills the interface contract (returning a `List<String>`) but doesn't provide actual functionality.

This design choice likely stems from a few considerations: 1) The `scanAllRegisters` functionality might be complex and irrelevant for the purpose of this mock service, which is primarily designed to provide simulated heating data. 2) The developers might intend to implement this functionality in a different, more realistic implementation of `HeatingDataReadService`. 3)  It's a deliberate way to highlight that this method isn't supported in the mock, potentially forcing test cases to focus on the core `getData()` functionality.  The "Not implemented" string acts as a clear indicator that attempts to call this method will not yield meaningful results.
