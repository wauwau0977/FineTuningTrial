Using an interface like `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` provides several benefits related to decoupling, testability, and maintainability:

*   **Decoupling:** The rest of the application interacts only with the interface, not the specific implementation. This allows the implementation to change (e.g., switching data source, modifying storage format) without requiring changes to any code that *uses* the data.  This enhances modularity and reduces the risk of cascading changes.
*   **Testability:**  Interfaces facilitate mocking during unit testing.  We can easily create a mock implementation of the interface to provide controlled test data, isolating the component under test.
*   **Flexibility:**  Different implementations of the interface can be swapped in at runtime or via configuration, allowing for dynamic behavior or A/B testing.
*   **Abstraction:** The interface defines *what* data is available, not *how* it's stored or retrieved. This hides implementation details and simplifies the application's overall design.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Interfaces are essential for dependency injection, making the application more configurable and easier to manage.
