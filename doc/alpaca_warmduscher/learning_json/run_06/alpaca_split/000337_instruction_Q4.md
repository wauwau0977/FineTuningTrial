For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts' with name 'about.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Explain the purpose and functionality of the `AboutComponent`'s constructor. What is dependency injection, and how is it used in this specific instance? What is the type of the injected dependency, and what role does this dependency play in the overall functionality of the component?
