The `@Scheduled` annotation is used to trigger the `pollData()` method at a predefined schedule.  `fixedDelayString` defines the time to wait *after* the previous execution of the method completes before starting a new execution. In this case, it's configured via a Spring property (`thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval`) with a default value of PT900s (900 seconds, or 15 minutes). `initialDelay` specifies a delay before the first execution of the scheduled task, here set to 0, meaning the task starts immediately after the application context is initialized.

If the `pollData()` method takes longer to execute than the `fixedDelayString` interval, subsequent executions will be delayed. The scheduler won't start a new execution until the current one completes.  This can lead to a buildup of delayed executions, effectively skipping polls. In extreme cases, if the method consistently takes longer than the interval, the scheduler might struggle to catch up, causing significant data gaps.  Consider using `fixedRate` instead of `fixedDelay` if consistent execution timing is paramount. Monitoring the execution time of `pollData()` is also crucial to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
