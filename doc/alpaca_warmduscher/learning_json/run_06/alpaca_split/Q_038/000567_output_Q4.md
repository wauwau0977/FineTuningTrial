The `<mat-card-content>` section utilizes Angular's flex-layout (`fxLayout`, `fxFlex`) to arrange temperature data in a responsive manner. On extra-small screens (`xs`), the layout is a column; on greater than extra-small screens (`gt-xs`), it's a row. 

Two `<div>` blocks, each representing a temperature reading, are created. The first displays the "Boiler Temperatur" along with the `heatingEntity.boilerTemp` value, formatted using the `number: '1.1-1'` pipe to show one digit before and one digit after the decimal point. The `mat-display-2` class provides a large font size for the temperature value.

The second `<div>` displays the "Ausssen-Temperatur", showing both `heatingEntity.ireg300TempOutdoor` and `meteoSwissEntity.temperature`, both also formatted with the `number: '1.1-1'` pipe.  The `meteoSwissEntity.temperature` is presented as a comparative value with the label “: Meteo-Schweiz Kloten” using the `mat-caption` class for smaller font size.

The `<mat-card-header>` displays the current time derived from `heatingEntity.measurementDate`. If `heatingEntity.id` is not null, the date is formatted using the `date: 'HH:mm'` pipe to show only the hour and minute. Otherwise, it displays "...".

Essentially, the structure uses flex-layout for responsiveness, Angular pipes for data formatting (number, date), and CSS classes (`mat-display-2`, `mat-caption`) to control the visual presentation of the temperature data.
