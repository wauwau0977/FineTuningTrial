`CrudRepository` is a Spring Data JPA interface that provides a standard way to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database table. It significantly simplifies database interactions by eliminating the need to write repetitive boilerplate code for these common operations. Instead of manually writing SQL queries or JDBC code, we simply define an interface that extends `CrudRepository`, specifying the entity type and primary key type.

Implicitly, this interface gains access to methods like `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`, `count()`, `deleteById()`, and `delete()`. These methods handle the underlying database interactions, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of the application. The `MeteoSwissRepository` interface inherits these methods, providing a convenient way to manage `MeteoSwissEntity` objects in the database.
