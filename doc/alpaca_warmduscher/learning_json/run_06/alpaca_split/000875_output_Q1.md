Using raw register names like `ireg50CircTemp` directly as field names introduces several challenges. Firstly, it lacks semantic meaning.  A developer unfamiliar with the heat pump controller's documentation wouldn't know what `ireg50CircTemp` represents without external information.  This makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

Secondly, it couples the code directly to the hardware or controller specifics. If the controller is updated or replaced, the field names might need to change, requiring significant code refactoring.

A more descriptive naming scheme would improve readability and maintainability.  For example, `circulatingTemperature` or `supplyWaterTemperature` would clearly indicate the purpose of the field.  Even better would be to introduce an enum to represent the different register types and then use that enum in the field name, e.g., `registerType50Temperature`. This approach abstracts the controller-specific details and makes the code more robust and easier to adapt to future changes.
