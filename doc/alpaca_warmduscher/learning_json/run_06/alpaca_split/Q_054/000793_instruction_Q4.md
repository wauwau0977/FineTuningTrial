For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java' with name 'HeatPumpRepository.java' we have the following question:

Explain the purpose of the `deleteMeasurements` method and how it prevents accidental data loss. Describe the crucial condition it checks before deleting any records and why this condition is important for data integrity. What JPA/Hibernate concepts or annotations might be used within this method to efficiently perform the deletion?
