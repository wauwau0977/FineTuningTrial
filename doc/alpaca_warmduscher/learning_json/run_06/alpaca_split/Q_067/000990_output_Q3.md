The `@Lob` annotation stands for "Large Object." It indicates that the `message` and `detail` fields can store large amounts of text data, exceeding the typical maximum length for `VARCHAR` or `TEXT` columns in a database.  Without `@Lob`, Hibernate might truncate the data or throw an exception if the content exceeds the default size limits.

The `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` annotation explicitly defines the Hibernate type to be used for these fields. While `@Lob` indicates a large object, this further specifies that these large objects should be treated as a `TextType`, which maps to a database column type suitable for storing large text strings (e.g., `TEXT` in PostgreSQL, MySQL, or `CLOB` in Oracle).  This is important because Hibernate needs to know how to map the Java `String` to a corresponding database column type capable of handling the potentially large data. In some database configurations, the `@Lob` annotation alone might not be enough to guarantee the correct mapping;  explicitly specifying the type ensures compatibility and proper data handling.
