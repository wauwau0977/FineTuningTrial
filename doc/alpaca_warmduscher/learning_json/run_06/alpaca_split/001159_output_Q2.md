This approach of appending characters from a second UUID to reach the expected fixed size introduces a potential collision risk, decreasing the uniqueness of the generated short text UUIDs.  While the probability of collision is low, it's not zero, and increases as more short texts are generated.  Appending substrings of other UUIDs doesn’t guarantee a truly random addition of characters; it’s statistically correlated to the generation of UUIDs.

Mitigation strategies include:

1. **Increase the number of randomly generated characters:** Instead of relying on appending from another UUID, generate truly random characters (using a secure random number generator) within the allowed character set until the desired length is reached. This is the best approach.

2. **Increase the base length:** If the goal is simply fixed length, consider generating longer short texts to reduce collision probability, while still using a purely random approach for the extra characters.

3. **Reject and Regenerate:**  If a collision is detected (which would require a collision detection mechanism – e.g., a set to store generated IDs), regenerate the short text. While this adds overhead, it guarantees uniqueness. This might be combined with a retry limit.

4. **Re-evaluate Fixed Length Requirement:** If possible, relax the fixed length requirement. While the original motivation is understandable (e.g. database key sizes), consider the trade-offs between a fixed length and potential collisions.

Given the context of a unique identifier, prioritizing uniqueness is crucial.  A purely random approach, even with slightly longer strings, is far superior to the current method.
