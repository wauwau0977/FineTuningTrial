This code snippet is likely trying to override the default left margin and bottom margin applied to the `mat-card-header-text` element within a Material Design card header. Material Design components often have default styles that might not align perfectly with the desired visual design of the application.

The `margin-left: 0` is removing the default left margin, while `margin-bottom: 10px` adds a bottom margin. This is likely being done to adjust the spacing of the text within the card header to better fit the overall design of the `overview-current` component.

`::ng-deep` is used because the `mat-card-header-text` element is encapsulated within the shadow DOM of the `mat-card` component. Without `::ng-deep`, the styles defined in the `overview-current.component.sass` file would not be able to penetrate the shadow DOM and apply to the `mat-card-header-text` element.  It's a workaround to override the Material Design default styling, despite being a deprecated approach.
