Embedding a video demonstration presents several accessibility challenges:

* **Users who are deaf or hard of hearing:**  They cannot access the audio content of the video.
* **Users who are blind or have low vision:** They cannot see the visual content of the video.
* **Users with cognitive disabilities:**  They may have difficulty understanding the information presented in the video.
* **Users without sufficient bandwidth:** May struggle to load and play the video.

Here are steps to ensure accessibility:

1. **Provide Captions/Subtitles:**  The *most* important step. Captions provide a text transcript of the audio content, making the video accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing.  WebVTT or SRT formats are standard.
2. **Provide a Transcript:** A full text transcript of the video's content should be available separately.  This is beneficial for users who prefer to read the information, users with assistive technologies, and search engine optimization.
3. **Audio Description:** For visually rich content, provide an audio description that narrates the visual elements of the video. This is crucial for users who are blind or have low vision. (This is more complex and often requires creating a separate audio track.)
4. **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensure the video player controls (play, pause, volume) are fully accessible via keyboard navigation.
5. **Sufficient Contrast:**  Ensure there is sufficient contrast between the video content and the background.
6. **Controls and Pause/Play:** The video player needs to have obvious, usable pause/play controls.
7. **Alternative Format:** Consider providing the information in an alternative format, such as a step-by-step guide with screenshots, as a companion to the video.
8. **ARIA Attributes:**  Use appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance the accessibility of the video player controls and provide semantic information to assistive technologies.
