For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.sass' with name 'boiler-chart.component.sass'... 
The `.date-selector` class contains nested styles targeting `.mat-form-field` and `.mat-checkbox`. What does this structure suggest about the components being styled, and how does this approach relate to the principles of component-based styling in Angular?
