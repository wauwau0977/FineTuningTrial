For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/MailSend.java' with name 'MailSend.java' we have the following question: 

The `init()` method is present in the `MailSend` class, but it's currently empty. Describe how you would modify this method to perform any necessary initialization tasks when the `MailSend` bean is created in the Spring context. Consider potential tasks like validating configuration properties or establishing a connection to the mail server (if applicable). Explain your approach and provide the code you would add to the method.
