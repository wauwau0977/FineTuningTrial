You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code defines a data class, `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`, designed to hold aggregated boiler statistics for a single hour. It encapsulates data related to boiler differences (increase and decrease) and the number of statistic records contributing to the aggregation. The class provides methods for creating instances, including an empty instance and one constructed from web service data. This entity is likely used within the 'Warmduscher' project to represent and process hourly boiler performance data.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsByHourEntity.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerStatsByHourEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Represents hourly boiler statistics data.  Provides factory methods for instance creation.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Input:** `hourOfTheDay` (number), `sumBoilerDiffIncrease` (number), `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` (number), `numOfStatisticRecords1` (number) - used during construction.
    - **Input:** `data: any` - Used in `ofWebService` for creating instance from external data.
    - **Output:** `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` instance.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - The constructor initializes the entity with the provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()` returns an instance with default values (all zeros).
    - `ofWebService()` creates an instance from external data, handling potential null values by returning an `emptyInstance()`.
- **External Interactions**: This class is likely used to receive data from a web service (as indicated by the `ofWebService` method). It might also be used to store data in a database or display it in a user interface, though this is not directly represented in the code.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - `ofWebService()` handles null input data by returning an `emptyInstance()`, preventing potential errors.  This provides a default/safe state.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:  The class is lightweight and involves only data encapsulation and simple construction. Performance is not a critical concern.
- **Scalability**:  Not directly related to scalability. Scalability would be a concern of the system using this entity, not the entity itself.
- **Security**: No specific security considerations within the class itself. Security would be handled at the system level (e.g., during data transmission and storage).
- **Maintainability**: The class is simple and well-defined, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class provides a safe default (`emptyInstance()`) when input data is missing, which improves reliability.
- **Usability**: The class is designed for internal use within the application and isn't directly exposed to users.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - `constructor()`: Initializes the entity with the provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()`: Returns a default instance with zero values.
    - `ofWebService()`: Creates an instance from web service data, handling null values.
- **Important logic flows**: Construction of the entity and handling of potentially null web service data.
- **Error handling**: `ofWebService()` handles null data.
- **Classes**:  `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` is a standalone class, with no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**:  This is a single class file, not part of a larger module structure.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript class definition syntax.
- Number data type.
- Object instantiation.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None explicitly used in this code. This code uses standard TypeScript features.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None are apparent from this code.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Data Validation**: Add validation to the constructor to ensure that the input values are within expected ranges.
- **Immutability**: Consider making the class immutable to prevent accidental modification of data. This could be achieved by making the properties `readonly`.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript already provides good type safety, but more specific type definitions could be used for the input parameters to further enhance code clarity and prevent errors.
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to the class and its methods to improve code documentation.
