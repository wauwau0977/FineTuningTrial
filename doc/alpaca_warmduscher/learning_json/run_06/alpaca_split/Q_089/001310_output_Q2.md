The commented-out `jsonCustomizer()` bean is intended to customize the `ObjectMapper` used by Jackson (a popular JSON library in Spring Boot) for serializing and deserializing objects to and from JSON. Specifically, it’s designed to set the date/time format used when converting `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` objects to JSON strings, and vice versa.

The code snippet `builder.simpleDateFormat(dateTimeFormat.toString());` sets the default date format for all dates serialized to JSON, while `builder.serializers(new LocalDateSerializer(dateFormat));` and `builder.serializers(new LocalDateTimeSerializer(dateTimeFormat));` provide custom serializers for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` respectively, ensuring they are serialized according to the configured `dateFormat` and `dateTimeFormat`.

**Difference between `FormattingConversionService` and `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer`:**

* **`FormattingConversionService`:** This configuration is primarily focused on *string conversion* – i.e., converting strings to `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, and other types during data binding (e.g., handling HTTP request parameters or form submissions). It affects how Spring parses strings into objects.  It deals with the input side - turning strings into Java objects.

* **`Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer`:** This configuration is focused on *serialization/deserialization* – i.e., converting Java objects to JSON strings (serialization) and vice versa (deserialization). It affects how objects are represented in JSON. It deals with the output side - turning Java objects into strings for APIs.

**Why use both?**

You need both because they address different aspects of date/time handling:

* **Data Binding:** The `FormattingConversionService` ensures that incoming date/time strings are correctly parsed into Java objects.
* **API Responses:** The `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer` ensures that dates and times are serialized in a consistent and standardized format in the JSON responses sent back to clients.

In other words, one handles *input*, and the other handles *output*. By configuring both, you ensure consistency and reliability throughout the entire request-response cycle.  Without both, you could have strings being parsed one way and serialized another, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.
