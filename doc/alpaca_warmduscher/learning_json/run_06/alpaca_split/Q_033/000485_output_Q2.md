If `HeatingDataService.convertDate` throws an exception, the exception will propagate up the call stack until it is caught by an error handler.  In the current code, there is no `try...catch` block within `ofWebService`, so the exception would bubble up to the calling code (wherever `ofWebService` is invoked). If no handler exists at a higher level, the application will likely crash, or display a generic error message.

Here's how we can handle this gracefully:

**1. `try...catch` Block within `ofWebService`:** The most direct approach is to wrap the call to `HeatingDataService.convertDate` within a `try...catch` block. This allows us to handle the exception locally within the method.

```typescript
static ofWebService(data: WebServiceHeatingData) {
  if (data == null) {
    return this.emptyInstance();
  } else {
    try {
      const measurementDate = HeatingDataService.convertDate(data.measurementDate);
      return new HeatingEntity(
        data.id,
        measurementDate,
        data.boilerTemp,
        // ... other properties
      );
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error
      console.error("Error converting date:", error);
      // Option 1: Return a default instance (similar to emptyInstance())
      return this.emptyInstance();
      // Option 2: Re-throw a more informative exception
      // throw new Error("Failed to convert measurement date", { cause: error });
      // Option 3: Return null (if the calling code can handle it)
      // return null;
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Error Handling Strategies within the `catch` Block:**

*   **Return a Default Instance:**  As shown in the example, returning `this.emptyInstance()` provides a fallback and allows the application to continue functioning, albeit with potentially incomplete data. This is a good option if the calling code can handle the default values.
*   **Re-throw a More Informative Exception:** Throwing a new exception with a more specific error message (and potentially including the original exception as a `cause`) provides more context to the calling code and facilitates debugging.
*   **Log the Error:** Logging the error to a central logging system (e.g., using a logging framework) provides valuable information for monitoring and troubleshooting.
*   **Return `null`:** If the calling code is designed to handle `null` values, returning `null` can be a viable option.
*   **Display a User-Friendly Message:** If the error is user-facing, display a clear and informative message to the user (e.g., "Failed to load heating data. Please try again later.").  Avoid displaying technical details directly to the user.

**3. Centralized Error Handling:**  For a more robust application, consider implementing a centralized error handling mechanism (e.g., using a global error handler in your framework). This allows you to handle all unhandled exceptions in a consistent manner.

**4. Error Boundaries (React/Angular):** If you are using a UI framework like React or Angular, you can use error boundaries to catch errors within specific components and prevent them from crashing the entire application.

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the error. However, it's crucial to implement some form of error handling to ensure that the application remains stable and provides a positive user experience.  Logging the error is always a good practice, even if you choose to handle it in another way.
