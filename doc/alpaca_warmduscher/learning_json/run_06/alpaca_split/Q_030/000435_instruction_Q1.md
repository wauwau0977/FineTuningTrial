For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts'...  The `get` method only handles caching the *Observable* itself, not the *data* emitted by the Observable. What are the implications of this design, and in what scenarios might it be beneficial or detrimental to cache the data instead of the Observable?
