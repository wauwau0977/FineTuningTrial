The `[overviewMode]="true"` binding is an input binding. It passes the boolean value `true` to the `overviewMode` input property of the `<app-boiler-chart>` component. This suggests that the `app-boiler-chart` component is designed to render different visualizations or behaviors depending on the value of this input.

The `overviewMode` flag likely dictates whether the chart displays a simplified or more detailed view. When set to `true`, the chart probably shows a high-level overview suitable for the current context (overview-current component). When set to `false` (or omitted), it could render a more detailed chart with additional features or data points.

Using a boolean flag like this is a common and effective way to control component behavior. It provides a clear and concise way to switch between different modes or states, making the component more versatile and reusable. It also makes the intent clear to other developers: the chart is specifically configured for an "overview" presentation within this component.
