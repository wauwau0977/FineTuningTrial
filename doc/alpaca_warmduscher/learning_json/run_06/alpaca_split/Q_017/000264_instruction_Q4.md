For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.spec.ts' with name 'utils-service.service.spec.ts' we have the following question: 
Let's imagine a scenario where we want to add a new test case to this suite. We need to verify the behavior of `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` when the number of data points is very low (e.g., only 2 data points) over a week-long period. What would be the expected interval key in this scenario, and how would you implement the new test case? Explain your reasoning.
