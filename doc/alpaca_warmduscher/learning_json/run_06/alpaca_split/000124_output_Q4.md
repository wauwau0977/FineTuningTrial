The commented-out rules `//button:hover, // .active-link` were likely intended to provide visual feedback to the user when interacting with buttons in the toolbar and to indicate which link/button is currently active. 

`button:hover` would have applied styles specifically when the mouse cursor hovers over a `<button>` element. The intention would have been to change the button's appearance (e.g., change its color) to visually indicate that it's interactive.

`.active-link` would have targeted an element with the class name "active-link". This class would likely be dynamically added to a button or link element to indicate that it represents the currently selected or active state. The intention would have been to provide a visual cue to the user about which option is currently selected within the toolbar.

The commented-out example suggests that the color change intended was to `#blueviolet`.
