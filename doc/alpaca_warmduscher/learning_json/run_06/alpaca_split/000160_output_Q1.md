A Service Worker is a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread, intercepting network requests and caching resources. It enables features like offline access, push notifications, and improved performance by serving cached content. It's a core component of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

`registrationStrategy: 'registerImmediately'` means the Service Worker is registered as soon as the application loads. This differs from `'registerWhenStable'`, which waits for the app to be stable for a specified duration before registering.

**Benefits of `'registerImmediately'`:**

*   **Faster offline availability:** Users can access cached content immediately after the initial load.
*   **Improved perceived performance:**  Assets can be cached and served from the cache quickly.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

*   **Development complexity:**  It can make development and debugging more challenging, as updates to the Service Worker might cause caching issues.
*   **Potential for outdated cache:** If a new version of the application is deployed, users might still be using an outdated cached version until the Service Worker is updated.  This requires careful versioning and cache invalidation strategies.
*   **Potential for breaking changes:** A poorly configured Service Worker can interfere with the application's functionality.
