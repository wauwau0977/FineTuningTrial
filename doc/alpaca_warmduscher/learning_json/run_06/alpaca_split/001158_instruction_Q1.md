For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UUIDUtils.java' with name 'UUIDUtils.java'... 
The code includes a comment explaining the benefits of a short text representation.  Imagine this utility is being used in a system where the short text UUIDs are stored in a database index. What potential performance implications should be considered when choosing a 22-character string versus a shorter string (e.g., 16 characters)?
