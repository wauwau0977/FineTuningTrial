Clients implementing `UnsafeRunnable` *must* handle the potential `Exception` that `run()` can throw. This can be done using a `try-catch` block around the call to the `run()` method in their implementation. Failure to do so will result in a compilation error because it violates the interface contract.

Declaring `Exception` broadly is useful when the exact type of exception that might occur is unknown or could vary widely. For instance, in a utility that interacts with external systems (network, file system, database), numerous exceptions could be thrown. Using `Exception` avoids the need to list every possible exception type in the interface method signature, keeping the interface cleaner. However, it's generally better practice to be as specific as possible in production code for more targeted error handling; this interface may be intentionally broad for maximum flexibility in potentially untrusted or dynamic code contexts.
