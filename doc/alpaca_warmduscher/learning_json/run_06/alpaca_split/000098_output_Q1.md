Using both `<mat-icon>` (which leverages Material Design components and likely uses Material Design icons) and directly referencing `material-icons` (likely a legacy icon font approach) can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies. Here's why:

*   **Redundant Definitions:** Both methods define icons, potentially leading to style clashes and rendering issues if the same icon is defined in both places with different styles.
*   **Inconsistent Styling:** The `<mat-icon>` component provides its own styling and theming capabilities. Directly applying styles from the `material-icons` font could override or interfere with Material Design's intended appearance.
*   **Maintenance Overhead:** Maintaining two different icon systems increases complexity and the risk of inconsistencies over time.

To address this, I'd recommend migrating entirely to the `<mat-icon>` component. This provides a consistent and themable icon solution within the Material Design framework.  The `material-icons` class should be removed. I would verify that all icons used are available within the Material Design icon set, and update the code accordingly. If some icons are not available, I would explore adding custom icons using Material Design's guidelines.
