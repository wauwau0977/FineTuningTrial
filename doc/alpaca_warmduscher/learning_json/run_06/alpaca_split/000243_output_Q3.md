The constructor uses dependency injection to provide the `ClientIdService` to the `MyHttpInterceptor`. This allows the interceptor to access the client ID without needing to create an instance of `ClientIdService` itself.  Dependency injection promotes loose coupling, making the code more maintainable, testable, and reusable. Specifically, the `ClientIdService` is injected because the interceptor needs to retrieve the client ID to add it as a header to outgoing HTTP requests. This ensures that the server knows which client is making the request.
