The `@Query` annotation is used in Spring Data JPA to define a custom query to be executed against the database. It allows you to specify a query in either JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or a native SQL dialect.

In this case, `nativeQuery = true` indicates that the query defined within the annotation is a native SQL query, meaning it's specific to the database system being used (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Without this flag, Spring Data JPA would attempt to parse the query as JPQL, which might not be compatible with the database's specific syntax or functions.

The SQL query itself (`select * from meteo_swiss ms where station_id=:stationId order by temperature_measure_date desc limit :maxRows`) retrieves data from the `meteo_swiss` table (aliased as `ms`). It filters the records based on a `station_id` (provided as a parameter `:stationId`), orders the results in descending order of `temperature_measure_date` (meaning the most recent entries appear first), and limits the number of returned records to `maxRows` (also a parameter).  This query effectively retrieves the latest `maxRows` weather entries for a specified station.
