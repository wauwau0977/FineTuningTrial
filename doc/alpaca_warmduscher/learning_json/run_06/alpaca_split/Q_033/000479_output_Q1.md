If the structure of the `data` object changes unexpectedly, several issues could arise:

*   **Runtime Errors:**  Accessing a non-existent property (e.g., `data.someNewProperty`) will result in a runtime error.
*   **Incorrect Data Mapping:**  If property names or data types change, the data might be mapped incorrectly, leading to logical errors in the application.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:**  The application might behave unpredictably due to the incorrect data being used.

To improve robustness:

*   **Defensive Programming:** Add checks to ensure that properties exist before accessing them.  For example, `data.hasOwnProperty('boilerTemp') ? data.boilerTemp : 0`.
*   **Schema Validation:** Implement a schema validation mechanism (e.g., using a library like Joi or Yup) to validate the structure and data types of the `data` object before processing it. This will ensure that the data conforms to the expected format.
*   **Type Definitions (TypeScript):** While TypeScript helps, defining a specific interface for the expected `data` structure is crucial. This allows the compiler to catch potential errors related to incorrect property names or types.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch any exceptions that occur during data processing and provide meaningful error messages.
*   **Versioning:** If the web service API is versioned, include the version information in the method and handle different versions appropriately.
