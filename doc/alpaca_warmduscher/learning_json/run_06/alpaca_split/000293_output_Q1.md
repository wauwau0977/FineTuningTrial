Duplicated styles can lead to maintainability issues in a large project. If a margin value needs to be changed, youâ€™d have to find and update it in multiple places, increasing the risk of inconsistencies. My preferred strategy is to define reusable variables (SASS variables) for common values like margins, paddings, colors, and font sizes.  These variables should be defined in a central theme file or a dedicated _variables.sass file.  Then, you can import this file into any component that needs these values.  This approach promotes consistency and simplifies future updates.  Additionally, utilizing a CSS methodology like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) can help structure styles and reduce duplication.
