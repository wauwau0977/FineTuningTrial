For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/Profiles.java' with name 'Profiles.java'... 
Considering this file as a starting point, how would you handle the addition of a profile that requires a completely different set of dependencies to be loaded (e.g., a profile integrating with a new type of sensor or external service)?  Describe the steps you’d take and the design principles you’d leverage.
