You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a utility service (`UtilsServiceService`) that provides a set of predefined time intervals (`Interval` class) and a function to determine the appropriate interval based on a desired number of data points and a time range. The service is designed to be used within the Warmduscher application to dynamically adjust data collection or display intervals.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `Interval`, `UtilsServiceService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Define a set of standard time intervals.
    - Determine the most suitable time interval based on the number of desired data points and the duration of the time range.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input (to `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints`):**
        - `maxDataPoints`: Integer representing the desired number of data points.
        - `start`: Date object representing the start of the time range.
        - `end`: Date object representing the end of the time range.
    - **Output (from `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints`):**
        - `Interval`: An `Interval` object representing the selected time interval (in seconds).
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` function calculates the time difference (in seconds) between the `start` and `end` dates.
    2. It calculates the desired interval length by dividing the time difference by the desired number of data points.
    3. It iterates through the pre-defined `standardIntervals` list.
    4. For each interval, it checks if the interval length is greater than the calculated `desiredInterval`.
    5. If a suitable interval is found (i.e., its length is greater than the `desiredInterval`), the function returns that interval.
    6. If no suitable interval is found, the function returns the smallest predefined interval as a default.
- **External Interactions**: None. The code is self-contained and does not interact with databases, APIs, or UI elements.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If `start` or `end` is null/undefined, the function returns the smallest predefined interval.
    - If `maxDataPoints` is zero or negative, the default (smallest) interval will be selected since the calculated `desiredInterval` would be either infinite or negative.  (No explicit handling, this is the default behavior)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The interval selection should be relatively fast, as it is likely to be performed frequently.  The iteration through the `standardIntervals` array is bounded by the number of predefined intervals, so performance should be adequate.
- **Scalability**: The code is not designed to handle a large number of intervals or a high volume of requests.  Scalability is not a primary concern.
- **Security**: No security considerations apply, as the code does not handle sensitive data or external interactions.
- **Maintainability**: The code is reasonably well-structured and easy to understand.  The use of constants and a dedicated `Interval` class improves readability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The code is relatively simple and should be reliable. Availability is not a primary concern.
- **Usability**: The service is designed for internal use within the Warmduscher application.  Usability is not a primary concern.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements apply.

## 5. Key Components

- **`Interval` class**:
    - Represents a time interval with a key (string), name (string), and interval length in seconds (number).
    - Includes a static `compare` method for comparing two intervals.
    - Includes a static `sort` method to sort an array of intervals.
- **`UtilsServiceService` class**:
    - Contains the logic for determining the appropriate time interval.
    - `getStandardIntervals()`: Returns the pre-defined array of intervals.
    - `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(maxDataPoints, start, end)`: Determines the appropriate interval based on the input parameters.
    - `getStandardIntervalsImpl()`:  A private method to create and populate the array of `Interval` objects.
- **Important logic flows**: The main logic flow resides within `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints`, which calculates the desired interval and iterates through the predefined intervals to find a suitable match.
- **Error handling**: Basic handling of null/undefined `start` or `end` dates.
- **Classes**:  `Interval` class. No subclasses.
- **Modules**:  No external modules are used.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures: Arrays
- Date/Time: Date object.
- Math: Basic arithmetic operations.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular**: Used for dependency injection (`@Injectable`).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**: For a very large number of predefined intervals, a more efficient search algorithm (e.g., binary search) could be used to find the appropriate interval.
- **Code Readability**: The interval definitions could be moved to a separate configuration file or constants file to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Testability**: Add unit tests to verify the correctness of the interval selection logic, particularly for edge cases and boundary conditions.
- **Configuration**: Allow the `standardIntervals` to be configurable, perhaps through a configuration file or external source, to allow for easier customization and extension.
- **Scalability Considerations**: If the number of predefined intervals grows significantly, consider using a more scalable data structure (e.g., a tree-based structure) to store the intervals.
