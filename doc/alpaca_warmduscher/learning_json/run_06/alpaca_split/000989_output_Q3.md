The `@Entity` annotation signifies that the `AuditLogEntity` class represents a database table. It's a core annotation used by JPA (Java Persistence API) to map Java objects to database tables.

The `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the database table that this entity maps to (in this case, "AUDIT_LOG_ENTITY"). It also allows you to define additional table properties, like indexes.

The `@Index` annotation defines an index on the `createDate` column in the `AUDIT_LOG_ENTITY` table. Indexes are database objects that speed up data retrieval operations. Without an index, the database would have to perform a full table scan to find rows matching a specific `createDate`. With the index, the database can quickly locate the relevant rows using the index, significantly improving query performance, particularly for queries that filter or sort by `createDate`.  The `name = "AUDIT_LOG_IX_1"` part assigns a name to the index, useful for database administration and optimization.
