You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

The `MemoryInfo` class is designed to provide information about the system's memory usage and processor count. It encapsulates total, maximum, and free memory (in KB), as well as the number of available processors.  The class includes a static method to retrieve current system information. This data is likely intended for monitoring, diagnostics, or resource management within the 'Warmduscher' application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/MemoryInfo.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MemoryInfo`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Provide a snapshot of the system's memory usage and processor count.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Input:** None directly. The class obtains information from `Runtime.getRuntime()`.
    - **Output:** `MemoryInfo` object containing memory and processor statistics.
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The `getCurrent()` method is called.
    2. `Runtime.getRuntime()` is used to retrieve system information.
    3. Memory values (total, max, free) are obtained in bytes and converted to kilobytes.
    4. The number of available processors is retrieved.
    5. A `MemoryInfo` object is created and populated with the gathered data.
    6. The populated `MemoryInfo` object is returned.
- **External Interactions:**
    - The class interacts with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) through `Runtime.getRuntime()`.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - No specific error handling is implemented within the class.  `Runtime.getRuntime()` methods are assumed to operate correctly.  Negative values are not explicitly handled, but the JRE should not return them.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The `getCurrent()` method should execute quickly, as it primarily retrieves information from the JRE.  Latency should be minimal.
- **Scalability:** The class is not inherently scalable, as it provides information about a single server's resources. It doesn't handle distributed systems or resource pooling.
- **Security:**  The class itself does not involve any security concerns.
- **Maintainability:** The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The class's reliability depends on the underlying JRE.  It's expected to be highly available.
- **Usability:** The class is easy to use. The static `getCurrent()` method provides a simple way to obtain the desired information.
- **Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements are identified.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `MemoryInfo()`: Default constructor.
    - `MemoryInfo(long totalMemoryKb, long maxMemoryKb, long freeMemoryKb)`: Constructor to initialize memory values.
    - `getCurrent()`: Static method to retrieve current system memory and processor information.
    - `getTotalMemoryKb()`: Getter for total memory.
    - `setTotalMemoryKb(long totalMemoryKb)`: Setter for total memory.
    - `getMaxMemoryKb()`: Getter for maximum memory.
    - `setMaxMemoryKb(long maxMemoryKb)`: Setter for maximum memory.
    - `getFreeMemoryKb()`: Getter for free memory.
    - `setFreeMemoryKb(long freeMemoryKb)`: Setter for free memory.
    - `getAvailableProcessors()`: Getter for available processors.
    - `setAvailableProcessors(long availableProcessors)`: Setter for available processors.
- **Important logic flows:** The core logic resides within the `getCurrent()` method, which gathers system information and creates a `MemoryInfo` object.
- **Error handling:** Minimal error handling.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:** The class is a self-contained module providing system information.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures:  Uses primitive `long` data types.
- Basic arithmetic operations.
- Object-oriented features (classes, getters, setters).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None.  The class relies solely on core Java functionalities.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None identified.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:**  The class is already quite efficient.  Caching the results of `getCurrent()` might provide a slight performance improvement if the information is frequently accessed but doesn't change rapidly.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already readable.  Adding Javadoc comments to each method would improve documentation.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  For a distributed system, this class would need to be adapted to collect information from multiple servers.  Consider using a remote monitoring service or a distributed data aggregation framework.
- **Error Handling**: While JRE methods are assumed to not throw exceptions, adding try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions would make the class more robust.
