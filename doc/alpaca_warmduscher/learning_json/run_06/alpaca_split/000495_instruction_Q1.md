For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts' with name 'meteoSwissEntity.ts'... 
If the `data` parameter in `ofWebService()` could contain additional properties beyond those used to populate the `MeteoSwissEntity`, how would you handle those extra properties to ensure they donâ€™t cause errors and that only the necessary data is used?
