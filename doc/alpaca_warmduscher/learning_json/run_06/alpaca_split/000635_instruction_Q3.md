For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts' with name 'environment.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
export const environment = {
 production: false,
 //serviceBaseURL: "http://localhost:49088/pi11",
 serviceBaseURL: "https://www.mindalyze.com/pi11/",
 ...
};
```
What is the purpose of the `serviceBaseURL` variable and how might changing its value affect the application's behavior?
