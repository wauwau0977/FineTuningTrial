For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/HeatPumpRepository.java' with name 'HeatPumpRepository.java'... 
Assume you need to add a feature to allow users to filter the heat pump measurements by a specific heat pump ID. How would you modify the `getHeatPumpMeasurements` method to accommodate this new requirement? Provide a code snippet demonstrating the change.
