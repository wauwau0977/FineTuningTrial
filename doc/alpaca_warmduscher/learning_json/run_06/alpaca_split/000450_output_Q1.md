Using a class like `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` offers benefits in terms of type safety, encapsulation, and potential for adding methods or business logic related to the data. The class definition clearly outlines the expected properties, reducing the risk of errors due to typos or incorrect data types.

However, for such a simple data structure, a class might be overkill. A simple interface would provide type safety without the overhead of a class, while a plain JavaScript object (with appropriate type annotations using TypeScript) would be the most lightweight approach. The choice depends on the complexity of the application and the need for maintainability and extensibility. If there's a possibility of adding behavior to this entity in the future, the class is a better choice. Otherwise, a simpler approach might be more appropriate.
