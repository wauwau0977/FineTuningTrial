The `@Immutable` annotation from Hibernate signifies that the `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` instances are intended to be unmodifiable after creation. It tells Hibernate to optimize for read operations by potentially caching the entity state and avoiding the need for concurrency control mechanisms.

**Implications and Effects:**

*   **Read Optimization:**  Hibernate can cache these immutable objects more efficiently, improving read performance.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Because the object cannot be modified after creation, multiple threads can safely access it without the need for synchronization.
*   **Design Constraints:** This severely restricts how the entity can be used.  No setters should ever be used. Any updates would require creating a *new* instance of the entity.
*   **Data Integrity:** It helps ensure data integrity by preventing accidental or unintended modifications.
*   **Usage Scenario:** This is well-suited for historical data or data that represents a point-in-time snapshot. MeteoSwiss data often fits this pattern, as readings are generally recorded and stored as historical records rather than being updated in place.
*   **Potential Challenges:** If any external factors *do* need to "update" the data, a new entity needs to be created. The old entity is not changed. This can create challenges regarding data lifecycle management and potentially increase storage requirements if old versions of the data are retained.

The fact that the entity is immutable strongly suggests a design where the data represents a fixed observation rather than something that changes frequently.
