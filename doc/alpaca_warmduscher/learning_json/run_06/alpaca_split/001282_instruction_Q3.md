For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
public void setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis) {
    this.startupTimeTakenInMillis = startupTimeTakenInMillis;
}
```
What is the purpose of the `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method, and what is the significance of the `this` keyword within the method body?
