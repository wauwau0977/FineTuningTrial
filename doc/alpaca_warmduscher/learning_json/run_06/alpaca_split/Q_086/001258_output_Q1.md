If the `StartupData` bean is not defined in the application context, a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` will be thrown when `context.getBean(StartupData.class)` is called. This would cause the application to fail to start. A more graceful handling would involve checking if the bean exists before attempting to retrieve it.  We could use `context.containsBean("startupData")` or a `try-catch` block around the `getBean()` call.  If the bean doesnâ€™t exist, we could log a warning message indicating that the startup time tracking is unavailable, rather than crashing the application. Alternatively, the listener could be conditionally registered (perhaps using a profile) if the `StartupData` bean is expected only in certain environments.
