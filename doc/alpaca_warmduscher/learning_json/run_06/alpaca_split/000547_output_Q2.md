The `data: [80]` array represents the initial value displayed on the gauge. In this case, the gauge will initially display a value of 80. Since the `type` is set to 'gauge', this value corresponds to the position of the gauge's pointer on the chart.

To dynamically update the gauge to reflect changes in the `heatingEntity`'s value, you would need to:

1.  **Access the heating value:** Extract the relevant value from the `heatingEntity` object (e.g., `this.heatingEntity.temperature` or similar) after it's updated within the `myReload()` method.
2.  **Update the series data:** Update the `data` property of the `series` array within the `gaugeChartOptions` object with the new value from the `heatingEntity`.
3.  **Redraw the chart:**  Since Angular doesn't automatically detect changes within the Highcharts options object, you'll need to trigger a redraw of the chart. This can be achieved by creating a reference to the chart instance after it's initialized and then calling `chart.series[0].setData([newValue]);` where `newValue` is the updated value from `heatingEntity`.

Here's a snippet of how you might implement this within the component:

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, OnInit, Output, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import {HeatingDataService} from "../heating-data.service";
import {interval} from 'rxjs';
import {HeatingEntity} from "../entities/heatingEntity";
import * as Highcharts from "highcharts";
import solidGauge from "highcharts/modules/solid-gauge.js";
import theme from 'highcharts/themes/dark-unica';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-overview-current-gauge',
  templateUrl: './overview-current-gauge.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./overview-current-gauge.component.sass']
})
export class OverviewCurrentGaugeComponent implements OnInit {
  // ... existing code ...

  chart: Highcharts.Chart | null = null; // Reference to the chart instance

  ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    // Assuming you have a chart container in your template with id 'chartContainer'
    this.chart = Highcharts.chart('chartContainer', this.gaugeChartOptions as any) as Highcharts.Chart;
  }

  myReload() {
    return this.heatingDataService.getCurrent(false)
      .subscribe((data: any) => {
        this.heatingEntity = HeatingEntity.ofWebService(data);
        this.receivedNewTHValue.emit(data);

        // Update the chart data
        if (this.chart) {
          this.chart.series[0].setData([this.heatingEntity.temperature]); // Assuming heatingEntity has a temperature property
        }
      });
  }
}
```

This approach assumes you have a container element in your template to render the Highcharts chart.  The `ngAfterViewInit()` lifecycle hook is used to initialize the chart after the view has been initialized. The `setData()` method on the series updates the chart's data, triggering a redraw. You would replace `this.heatingEntity.temperature` with the appropriate property of your heating entity.
