You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the `MeteoSwissEntity` class. This class represents a data entity for storing meteorological data retrieved from MeteoSwiss, a Swiss weather service.  It's designed to be persisted in a database, likely as part of a larger system for collecting and analyzing weather information. The entity stores data like temperature, sunshine percentage, wind speed, and direction, along with timestamps and station information.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissEntity.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoSwissEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Represents and stores meteorological data from MeteoSwiss.  Provides getter and setter methods for all data fields.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  This class doesnâ€™t handle direct user input. Data is populated through setter methods and retrieved through getter methods. The data is intended for persistence, and subsequent retrieval from a database.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The class is a simple data holder. The workflow involves setting the various data fields with values received from an external source (e.g., an API call to MeteoSwiss) and then persisting the object to a database.  Retrieval would involve querying the database and then using the getter methods to access the stored data.
- **External Interactions:** The class itself does not handle external interactions directly. It is designed to be used in conjunction with other components that handle data acquisition (from MeteoSwiss) and persistence (to a database).
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - The `id` field is automatically generated using `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` upon instantiation, ensuring uniqueness.
    - `Date` fields (`createDate`, `sunshineMeasureDate`, `temperatureMeasureDate`, `windMeasureDate`) are initialized with `new Date()` for `createDate`, while others are nullable. Handling of null values would need to be considered in the surrounding code.
    - While the class does not explicitly handle invalid data, the surrounding code should validate input values before setting them on the entity.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The class itself is lightweight and has minimal performance overhead. Performance will primarily depend on database interactions.
- **Scalability:** Scalability is not directly addressed within the class itself. Scalability will depend on the database infrastructure and the overall architecture of the application.
- **Security:** The class does not directly address security concerns. Security will need to be handled at the application and database levels.
- **Maintainability:** The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to maintain and modify.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  Reliability and availability depend on the database infrastructure and the surrounding application. The UUID generation ensures unique identification of entities.
- **Usability:** The class is straightforward to use, with clear getter and setter methods.
- **Compliance:**  Compliance requirements depend on the specific data handling policies and regulations relevant to the application.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - **Constructor:** Creates a new `MeteoSwissEntity` instance, generating a unique ID and setting the `createDate`.
    - **Getter/Setter Methods:** Provide access to and modification of the entity's data fields.
    - **`equals()` & `hashCode()`:** Override the default methods for object comparison, based on the `id` field.
    - **`toString()`:** Provides a string representation of the object for debugging and logging.
- **Important logic flows:**  The core logic is data encapsulation and attribute access.  There is no complex logic within the class itself.
- **Error handling:** No specific error handling is implemented within the class.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:**  The class is a standalone entity and doesn't rely on or expose any specific modules.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- `java.util.Date`: Used for storing timestamps.
- `java.util.UUID`: While not directly used in the class itself, `UUIDUtils` presumably utilizes this for UUID generation.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **None explicitly declared within the class code itself.**  The implementation of `UUIDUtils` is not visible within the provided code.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.UUIDUtils`:  Used to generate a unique ID for each entity.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** N/A. The class is a simple data holder and unlikely to be a performance bottleneck.
- **Code Readability:**  The code is already reasonably readable. Adding Javadoc comments to each field and method would improve documentation.
- **Security Improvements:**  Consider validating input data to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability Considerations:** If high volumes of data are expected, consider using a more efficient data type for timestamps (e.g., `long` representing milliseconds since epoch) or using a database with optimized timestamp support. 
- **Data Validation:** Implement data validation within the setter methods to ensure data integrity. For example, check if temperature values are within a reasonable range.
- **Consider using Builder Pattern:** For complex object creation with multiple attributes, a Builder pattern can improve readability and maintainability.
