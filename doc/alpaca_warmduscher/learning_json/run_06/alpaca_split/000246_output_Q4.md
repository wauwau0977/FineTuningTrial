The `intercept` method is the core of the HTTP interception logic. It receives two inputs: `req` which is an instance of `HttpRequest<any>`, representing the outgoing HTTP request, and `next` which is an instance of `HttpHandler`, used to pass the request along the chain.

The method first retrieves the client ID using the `clientIdService`. It then retrieves the client version from the `environment` configuration using `environment.buildTimestampClient`.

It then clones the original request (`req.clone()`) to create a modified request.  Crucially, it modifies the request's headers by setting two custom headers:

*   `ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID`:  The value is the client ID retrieved earlier.
*   `ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_VERSION`: The value is the client version retrieved earlier.

Finally, it passes the modified request (`modifiedReq`) to the next interceptor in the chain (or the backend) using `next.handle(modifiedReq)`. The method returns an `Observable<HttpEvent<any>>`, which represents the response from the server. This ensures the intercepted request continues its normal lifecycle, while providing the added client identifying information.
