For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts' with name 'soleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the purpose and functionality of the `ofWebService` static method within the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` class. Detail how it handles potential null input and how it transforms the input data into a new instance of the class. Specifically, what role does `HeatingDataService.convertDate` play in this process?
