This pattern represents the use of getter and setter methods (also known as accessor and mutator methods) for accessing and modifying private class fields. `buildVersionServer` is likely a private field (though not shown in the snippet, it's strongly implied by the presence of getter/setter).

The purpose of this pattern is encapsulation â€“ a core principle of object-oriented programming. By making the field private and providing controlled access through getter and setter methods, the class can:

*   **Control access:**  It prevents direct external modification of the field.
*   **Validate data:** The setter method can include validation logic to ensure that the new value is valid before assigning it to the field.
*   **Implement side effects:** The getter or setter can perform additional actions (e.g., logging, triggering events) when the field is accessed or modified.
*   **Maintain data integrity:** This pattern enables the class to control how its internal state is managed, ensuring consistency and preventing invalid data.
