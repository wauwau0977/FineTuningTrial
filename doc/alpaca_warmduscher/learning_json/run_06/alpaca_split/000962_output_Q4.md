To add the average temperature difference to the `BoilerStatsByHour` interface, I would define the following method:

```java
Double getAvgBoilerTempDiff();
```

*   **Method Name:** `getAvgBoilerTempDiff()`
*   **Return Type:** `Double`
*   **Purpose:** This method would return the average temperature difference calculated for the hour represented by the interface. The average would be calculated by summing all temperature differences during that hour and dividing by the number of records contributing to the calculation (represented by `getNumOfStatisticRecords1()`).  The implementation within a class implementing this interface would handle the calculation.

The addition of this method would require updating the `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation to include the new property. The annotation would become:

```java
@JsonPropertyOrder({"hourOfTheDay", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", "getAvgBoilerTempDiff", "numOfStatisticRecords1"})
```

By including `"getAvgBoilerTempDiff"` in the list, the JSON serialization will ensure the average temperature difference property appears in that specific position in the output. This maintains a predictable and consistent serialization format.
