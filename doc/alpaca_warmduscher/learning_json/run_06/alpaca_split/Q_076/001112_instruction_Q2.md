For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/MailSend.java' with name 'MailSend.java'... 
The `send` method throws a `RuntimeException` when a `MessagingException` occurs.  Considering the applicationâ€™s overall architecture, and potential error handling strategies, what are the pros and cons of handling the `MessagingException` in this way versus potentially wrapping it in a custom exception type specific to email sending failures, and letting a higher-level component handle it?
