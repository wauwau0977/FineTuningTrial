You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This class, `AuditLogEntity`, represents an audit log entry. Itâ€™s designed to persist information about events happening within the `Warmduscher` application, like operations performed, potential errors, and relevant details. The entity stores key information like a timestamp, scopes (for categorization), a message, details, and any exceptions that occurred. It is intended to be used with a persistent storage system (likely a relational database) using JPA/Hibernate.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java
- **Class Name(s):** `AuditLogEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations:** This class primarily functions as a data holder for audit log information. It defines the structure of the data to be stored.  The class itself doesn't contain any core operational logic beyond data access methods (getters and setters).
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  The class doesn't have direct user inputs or outputs.  It receives data via constructors and setters, and provides data via getters, for use by other components.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The workflow involves creating an instance of `AuditLogEntity`, populating it with relevant information, and then persisting it to a database.  Retrieval would involve querying the database and mapping the results to instances of this class.
- **External Interactions:**
    - **Database:**  This class is designed for persistent storage in a database via JPA/Hibernate.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    - The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are implemented for correct comparison and hashing.
    - The class handles potentially large text fields by using `@Lob` and `@Type(type = "org.hibernate.type.TextType")` for the `message`, `detail`, and `exception` fields.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**  The class is lightweight and should have minimal performance overhead. The `@Lob` fields might impact performance depending on the database and size of the data stored.
- **Scalability:** The class itself does not directly affect scalability, but the database chosen and its configuration will be critical for handling a large number of audit log entries.
- **Security:** No specific security features are directly implemented in this class. Security considerations are related to the storage and access control of the audit log data in the database.
- **Maintainability:** The class is well-structured with clear fields and getters/setters, making it relatively easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The reliability and availability are dependent on the underlying database system.
- **Usability:** The class is straightforward and easy to use for developers integrating audit logging into the `Warmduscher` application.
- **Compliance:**  The class itself does not directly address compliance requirements, but the audit log data it stores may be relevant for various compliance regulations (e.g., data privacy).

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions:**
    - **Constructor(String scope1, String scope2, String scope3, String message, String detail, String exception):**  Initializes the audit log entry with provided data.
    - **Getters & Setters:** Provide access to and modification of the class fields.
    - **`equals(Object o)`:** Checks for equality with another `AuditLogEntity` instance based on the `id` field.
    - **`hashCode()`:** Returns the hash code based on the `id` field.
- **Important logic flows:** Data encapsulation and persistence via getters/setters and database interaction handled by the persistence layer.
- **Error handling:** No explicit error handling within the class itself.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:**  Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.audit` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **Java Data Types:** Basic Java data types like `String`, `Date`.
- **Object Orientation:** Use of classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Annotations:** Use of `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Index`, `@Lob`, `@Type`.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **JPA/Hibernate:** Used for object-relational mapping and database persistence.  (Implicit dependency, not explicitly imported in the code snippet, but evident through the annotations.)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.UUIDUtils`:** Used to generate unique identifiers for audit log entries.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements:**  Consider using a more efficient UUID generation strategy if performance becomes a concern.
- **Code Readability:**  The class is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Consider adding logging of user/system information to the audit log for better security auditing.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  For very high volumes of audit logs, consider database partitioning and indexing strategies. Consider asynchronous logging to avoid blocking application threads.
