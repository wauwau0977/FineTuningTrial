The `myReload()` method initializes and populates numerous data arrays (e.g., `boilerTempAverage`, `soleInTempMinMax`) with data from the fetched services.  Given the potential for large datasets, how could you improve the memory efficiency and rendering performance of the chart by adopting a more optimized data structure or rendering technique, instead of relying solely on these arrays?
