You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

The `GlobalSynced` class provides a mechanism for synchronized access to a shared object (`syncedObject`) using a `ReentrantLock`. It allows performing operations on this object in a thread-safe manner, with optional hooks for before and after operation execution. This class is designed for scenarios requiring global synchronization across multiple threads, especially within the `Warmduscher` project.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/GlobalSynced.java
- **Class Name(s):** `GlobalSynced`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Provides synchronized access to a generic object `T`. Executes a provided `MutexOperation` on the object within a locked section.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input**: A `MutexOperation<T>` instance containing the operation to be performed on the `syncedObject`.
    - **Output**: None explicitly. The `MutexOperation` modifies the `syncedObject` in place.  Logs errors encountered within the `try-catch-finally` block.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. Acquire a lock using `reentrantLock.lock()`.
    2. Execute the `before()` hook, if provided.
    3. Execute the provided `MutexOperation` on the `syncedObject`.
    4. Execute the `after()` hook, if provided.
    5. Release the lock using `reentrantLock.unlock()`.
    6. If any exception occurs during operation execution, the `after()` hook is still attempted to be executed, and the exception is logged.
- **External Interactions**:  Logging via SLF4J.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Exception Handling**: A `try-catch-finally` block ensures that the `reentrantLock` is always released, even if an exception occurs during operation execution.  The `after()` hook is attempted even if an exception occurs. Exceptions during the `after()` hook execution are logged.
    - **Null Hooks**: Handles the case where `hooks` is null gracefully, simply skipping the `before()` and `after()` hook calls.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The performance is dependent on the contention for the `ReentrantLock`.  Lock acquisition and release should be relatively quick, but high contention could lead to delays.
- **Scalability**: Scalability is limited by the single `ReentrantLock`.  For very high-throughput scenarios, consider alternative synchronization mechanisms.
- **Security**:  The class itself does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. Security depends on the implementation of the `MutexOperation` and the `syncedObject`.
- **Maintainability**:  The code is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The `try-finally` block ensures that the lock is always released, preventing deadlocks and ensuring reliability.
- **Usability**: The class is designed to be reusable and easy to integrate into other parts of the application.
- **Compliance**: N/A

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `GlobalSynced(T syncedObject, Hooks<T> hooks)`: Constructor. Initializes the `syncedObject`, `hooks` and `reentrantLock`.
    - `requestOperation(MutexOperation<T> m)`:  Executes the provided `MutexOperation` on the `syncedObject` within a synchronized block.
- **Important logic flows**: The primary logic flow is encapsulated within the `requestOperation` method, which acquires a lock, executes the operation, and releases the lock in a `try-finally` block.
- **Error handling**: The `try-catch-finally` block handles exceptions during operation execution and ensures the lock is released.
- **Classes**:  N/A, no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**:  This class is a utility module for thread synchronization.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Generics**: Used to define a class that can work with objects of any type (`T`).
- **Concurrency**: `ReentrantLock` for thread synchronization.
- **Exception Handling**: `try-catch-finally` blocks for error handling and resource management.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **SLF4J**: For logging.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`MutexOperation<T>`**: An interface presumably defining the operation to be executed on the synced object. (Not defined in the given code snippet, inferred from usage).
- **`Hooks<T>`**: An interface presumably defining the before and after hooks. (Not defined in the given code snippet, inferred from usage).

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**:  For very high contention scenarios, consider using a more sophisticated synchronization mechanism, such as a `StampedLock` or a lock striping approach.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already quite readable.
- **Security Improvements**: No specific security improvements are needed in this class itself. Security depends on the implementation of the `MutexOperation` and the `syncedObject`.
- **Scalability Considerations**: If the `syncedObject` represents a large amount of data, consider using a more granular locking strategy to improve concurrency and scalability.  Consider alternative data structures optimized for concurrent access.  Using a copy-on-write strategy might also be an option depending on the use case.
