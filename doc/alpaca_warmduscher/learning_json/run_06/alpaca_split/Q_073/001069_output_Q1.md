The `modBusMasterHooks` object is an instance of a custom `Hooks` class that implements an interface allowing the execution of code *before* and *after* a critical operation â€“ in this case, connecting and disconnecting from the Modbus master. It essentially provides a mechanism for adding custom behavior around the Modbus connection lifecycle without modifying the core connection/disconnection logic.

Specifically:

*   **Purpose:** It provides a way to encapsulate connection and disconnection actions. The `before` hook ensures the Modbus master is connected before attempting any operations, and the `after` hook ensures the connection is gracefully closed after operations are complete.
*   **Utilization:**  The `init()` method initializes the `modbusMasterSynced` object with the Modbus master and this `modBusMasterHooks` instance.  The `GlobalSynced` class internally utilizes these hooks when the `requestOperation` method is called. The `requestOperation` method will invoke the `before` hook before executing the passed lambda, and the `after` hook after execution.
*   **Problem Solved:** It decouples connection management from the main data reading logic. Without this, connection and disconnection logic might be scattered throughout the `getData()` and `scanAllRegisters()` methods. This hook-based approach promotes cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable code. It also centralizes connection management in a single place, improving reliability and reducing the risk of errors. It effectively provides a consistent and reliable mechanism to establish and close the Modbus connection before and after operations, even in multi-threaded environments, as the `GlobalSynced` class likely handles synchronization.
