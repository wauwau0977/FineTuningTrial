Using `int` for `maxRows` and `groupEveryNthSecond` introduces potential issues. For `maxRows`, a negative value could lead to unexpected behavior or an exception, or even a database error depending on how the query is constructed. A very large value could lead to performance problems or resource exhaustion by attempting to retrieve an excessive amount of data. For `groupEveryNthSecond`, a value of zero would likely cause a division by zero error or unexpected aggregation results. A negative value is illogical for grouping intervals.

Mitigation strategies:

1.  **Input Validation:**  Before passing these values to the database query, validate them. Ensure `maxRows` is non-negative and within a reasonable upper bound (defined based on system resources and acceptable performance).  Ensure `groupEveryNthSecond` is strictly positive. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the validation fails.
2.  **Defensive Programming:** Within the method, check for these invalid values again as a safeguard, even after input validation, as external factors might still affect them.
3.  **Use a More Appropriate Type:** Consider using `long` for `maxRows` if very large result sets are expected, providing a wider range of acceptable values.  While still requiring validation, it reduces the likelihood of overflow.
4.  **Limit Resources:** Implement server-side limits to prevent extremely large requests regardless of client-provided values. A configurable maximum number of rows or a maximum grouping interval can act as a safety net.
