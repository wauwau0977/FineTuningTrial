The `<mat-toolbar>` element is a component from the Angular Material library designed to create a header or footer application bars. It's a container for application branding, navigation, and actions. In this case, it's being used to structure the footer navigation bar. It provides a consistent and visually appealing bar with customizable appearance.

The `<mat-toolbar-row>` is a child element of `<mat-toolbar>` and represents a row within the toolbar. It's used to organize content horizontally within the toolbar. In this case, the buttons for navigation (dashboard, insights, about) are likely placed inside this row.  Using `<mat-toolbar-row>` allows for easy alignment and layout of the buttons within the toolbar, ensuring they are displayed side-by-side. Without it, the toolbar's layout might not be as predictable or visually consistent. It essentially provides the internal structure for how content is arranged inside the toolbar container.
