The `ofWebService()` method is a factory method designed to create a `MeteoSwissEntity` instance from data received from a web service (presumably the MeteoSwiss service). It acts as an intermediary, transforming the raw data from the service into an object of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class. The null check ensures that if the web service returns no data, the method returns an `emptyInstance()` to prevent errors.

The `HeatingDataService.convertDate()` method is being called on the date-related properties (`temperatureMeasureDate`, `temperatureMeasureDateMin`, `temperatureMeasureDateMax`, `windMeasureDate`, `windMeasureDateMin`, `windMeasureDateMax`) because the date format returned by the web service might not be directly compatible with the `Date` object in JavaScript/TypeScript.  The `convertDate()` method likely parses the date string from the web service and converts it into a JavaScript `Date` object, ensuring that the `MeteoSwissEntity` stores dates in a usable format. This promotes data consistency and avoids potential errors when working with dates within the application.
