The heating entity’s measurement time is displayed using an interpolation with a conditional operator: `{{ (heatingEntity.id !== null) ? (heatingEntity.measurementDate | date: 'HH:mm') : "..."}}`. This means: If `heatingEntity.id` is not null, the `heatingEntity.measurementDate` is formatted as "HH:mm" using the `date` pipe; otherwise, "..." is displayed.

Potential issues:

1.  **`heatingEntity.id` isn't a reliable indicator of data availability:** Relying on `heatingEntity.id` being present to determine if `heatingEntity.measurementDate` is valid is brittle. The ID might be present even when the date is missing or invalid.
2.  **No handling for invalid `measurementDate`:** If `heatingEntity.measurementDate` *is* present but invalid (e.g., not a Date object, or contains invalid values), the `date` pipe might throw an error or display an unexpected value.
3.  **Lack of user feedback:** Simply showing "..." doesn't inform the user *why* the time isn't displayed.

Addressing the issues:

1.  **Check `heatingEntity.measurementDate` directly:**  Instead of checking `id`, the component logic should verify if `heatingEntity.measurementDate` is a valid Date object before attempting to format it.  This is best done in the component’s TypeScript file, not directly in the HTML.
2.  **Defensive programming in the component:**  In the TypeScript component, use a getter or a computed property to determine the formatted time string. This getter would check the validity of `heatingEntity.measurementDate` and return either the formatted time or a default message.
3.  **Provide informative feedback:**  Instead of "...", display a message like "No data available" or "Data loading..." to provide the user with more context.  Consider adding an error state/flag on the component that is displayed if the data is invalid.
