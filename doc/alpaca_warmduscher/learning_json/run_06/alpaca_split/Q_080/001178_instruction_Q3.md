For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
static void execute(UnsafeRunnable c) {
    if (c == null) {
        return;
    }
    try {
        c.run();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```

What is the purpose of the `UnsafeRunnable` interface, and how does this `execute` method differ from the others in terms of return type and potential use cases?
