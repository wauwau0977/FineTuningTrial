The `init` method is designed to initialize the `HeatingDataReadService` before any data can be read from the heat pump. It sets up the necessary resources and establishes communication with the device.

**Purpose:** The primary goal of `init()` is to prepare the service for operation. This likely includes:

*   Establishing a connection to the heat pump (e.g., via Modbus, TCP/IP, or serial communication).
*   Configuring communication parameters (e.g., baud rate, timeout).
*   Initializing internal data structures or caches.
*   Performing any necessary validation or testing of the connection.

**Exceptions:**

The `init` method can throw an `Exception`, which is a broad exception type. Potential specific exceptions that could occur include:

*   `IOException`: If there are problems establishing a connection to the heat pump (e.g., network error, serial port unavailable).
*   `CommunicationException` (custom): A specific exception indicating a communication error with the heat pump.
*   `ConfigurationException`: If there are errors in the service's configuration (e.g., invalid parameters).
*   `DeviceNotAvailableException`: If the heat pump is not reachable or responding.

**When and How to Call:**

The `init` method should be called **once** before any other methods of the `HeatingDataReadService` are invoked.  Itâ€™s crucial to ensure the service is initialized before attempting to read data.  A typical usage pattern would be:

1.  Instantiate the `HeatingDataReadService`.
2.  Call `init()` to initialize the service.
3.  Call `getData()` or `scanAllRegisters()` to read data.

It's important to handle the potential `Exception` thrown by `init()` appropriately, potentially logging the error and preventing the application from proceeding if initialization fails. The method should likely be called during the application's startup phase, to ensure the service is ready to handle data requests.  The application should ideally also have a mechanism for retrying the initialization process if it fails initially, to handle temporary communication issues.
