The `@font-face` declarations define custom fonts, in this case 'Roboto' and 'Material Icons', to be used on the webpage.  Instead of relying on system fonts, these rules allow the browser to download and use specific font files directly.

The reason for numerous sources (multiple `src: url(...)`) within each `@font-face` rule is to provide font files in different formats (e.g., `.woff2`, `.woff`) and character subsets. This is crucial for browser compatibility and optimization. Browsers support different font formats. Providing multiple formats allows the browser to choose the one it supports best.

More importantly, the declarations target different Unicode ranges. This is a form of font subsetting.  Rather than downloading the entire 'Roboto' font family, only the glyphs needed for the characters used on the page (or a specific language) are downloaded.  This significantly reduces the font file size and improves page load time. The Unicode ranges cover a wide variety of languages and characters, ensuring the fonts will render correctly for a global audience.

Potential performance implications:

*   **Increased Initial Load Time:** Even with subsetting, downloading multiple font files, even relatively small ones, can add to the initial page load time, particularly on slower connections.
*   **Render Blocking:** The browser needs to download and parse the font files before it can render text with those fonts, which can cause a delay in rendering visible content.
*   **Server Load:** Serving many font files can put a load on the web server, especially if many users are accessing the site simultaneously.

Mitigation strategies:

*   **Font Loading Strategies:** Use `<link rel="preload">` to prioritize font downloads, or consider using `font-display: swap` to render text immediately with a fallback font while the custom font loads.
*   **Font Optimization:** Further reduce font file sizes using compression techniques.
*   **Caching:** Ensure fonts are properly cached by the browser and the server.
*   **Web Font Loading Libraries:** Consider using a web font loading library that handles font loading, caching, and fallback strategies automatically.
*   **Use a CDN:** Distribute the fonts via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve download speeds.
*   **Limit Font Variety:** Only include fonts and character sets that are actually used on the page.
