The `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class serves as a data container for representing boiler statistics aggregated by the hour. It holds four numerical properties: `hourOfTheDay`, `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, and `numOfStatisticRecords1`.

Based on the property names, it appears this class is used to track changes or differences in boiler performance throughout the day.  `hourOfTheDay` likely indicates the hour the statistics pertain to.  `sumBoilerDiffIncrease` and `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` probably represent cumulative increases or decreases in a boiler-related metric (e.g., temperature, pressure) during that hour. `numOfStatisticRecords1` likely denotes the number of individual statistics that contributed to these sums. This data could be used for performance monitoring, trend analysis, or reporting.

The `emptyInstance` method creates and returns a new `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` instance with all properties initialized to zero. This is useful as a default or placeholder value when statistics are not yet available or when handling potentially null or undefined data from a web service or other data source. It provides a safe and consistent starting point for calculations or data processing.
