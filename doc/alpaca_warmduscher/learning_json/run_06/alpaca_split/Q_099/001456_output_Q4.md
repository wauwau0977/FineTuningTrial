The `MemoryInfo` class provides getter (accessor) and setter (mutator) methods for each of its private instance variables: `totalMemoryKb`, `maxMemoryKb`, `freeMemoryKb`, and `availableProcessor`.  These methods are crucial for encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

**Purpose of Getters and Setters:**

*   **Encapsulation:** Getters and setters allow controlled access to the object's internal state. Instead of directly accessing the private instance variables (which would violate encapsulation), external code interacts with the object through these methods. This protects the object's integrity and allows the class to control how its state is modified.
*   **Data Validation:** Setters can include validation logic to ensure that the values being assigned to the instance variables are valid. This helps prevent errors and maintain data consistency. While this particular implementation doesn't include validation, it could easily be added within the setter methods.
*   **Abstraction:** Getters and setters provide an abstraction layer, hiding the internal implementation details of the object from external code. This allows the internal implementation to be changed without affecting the code that uses the object, as long as the getter and setter interfaces remain consistent.

**Getter and Setter for `availableProcessor`:**

```java
public long getAvailableProcessorS() {
    return availableProcessorS;
}

public void setAvailableProcessorS(long availableProcessorS) {
    this.availableProcessorS = availableProcessorS;
}
```

*   **`getAvailableProcessorS()` (Getter):** This method returns the value of the `availableProcessorS` instance variable, providing external code with access to the number of available processors.  It does not modify the object's state.
*   **`setAvailableProcessorS()` (Setter):** This method sets the value of the `availableProcessorS` instance variable. It allows external code to modify the number of available processors. In a more robust implementation, you could add validation to ensure the provided value is reasonable (e.g., non-negative).
