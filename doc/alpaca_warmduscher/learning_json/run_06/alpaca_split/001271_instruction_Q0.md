You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This class, `StartupData`, serves as a simple data holder for the application startup time taken in milliseconds. Itâ€™s designed to be a Spring-managed bean, allowing other components to access the startup time information. The primary purpose is to provide diagnostic information about application initialization performance.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `StartupData`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Store and retrieve the application startup time.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Input:** The startup time in milliseconds is set via the `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method.
    - **Output:** The stored startup time in milliseconds is retrieved via the `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method updates the private `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field with the provided value.
    2. The `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method returns the current value of the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field.
- **External Interactions**: None. This class operates in isolation.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - No specific error handling is implemented. The class simply stores and retrieves a long value.  Negative values could be set, but this is not handled or validated.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The getter and setter methods should have negligible execution time.
- **Scalability**: The class is inherently scalable as it represents a simple data holder and doesn't involve complex operations.
- **Security**: No security concerns are present as the class does not handle sensitive data.
- **Maintainability**:  The class is very simple and easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class is reliable as it has minimal dependencies and functionality.  Availability is dependent on the Spring container.
- **Usability**:  Easy to integrate into other Spring-managed components.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()`: Retrieves the startup time in milliseconds.
    - `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis)`: Sets the startup time in milliseconds.
- **Important logic flows**: The class is straightforward and does not involve any complex logic flows.
- **Error handling**:  No explicit error handling is implemented.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is a standalone module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Primitive data types (long)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**:  Used for dependency injection through the `@Component` annotation.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: The class is already very performant.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already very readable.
- **Security Improvements**: No security concerns are present.
- **Scalability Considerations**: No scalability concerns.
- **Validation:** Add validation to the setter to prevent setting negative startup times, if such a value is considered invalid.
- **Consider using a logging framework:** Instead of storing the value in a bean, consider logging the startup time directly upon application initialization. This would simplify the architecture and remove the need for a dedicated data holder class.
