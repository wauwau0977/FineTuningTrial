The current implementation directly uses `interval` with a value from the `environment` configuration. This makes it difficult to test the component in isolation because you can't easily control the timing of the refresh interval for testing purposes.

To make it more testable, we should abstract the interval creation into a separate function or service and inject it into the component. This allows us to mock the interval during unit testing.

Here's how you could modify the code:

```typescript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {interval, Observable} from "rxjs";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
import {HeatingDataService} from "./heating-data.service";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'thserver-client';

  constructor() {
  }

  myFullPageRefresh(): void {
    window.location.reload();
  }

  subscribe;

  setupRefreshInterval(intervalMs: number): void {
    this.subscribe = interval(intervalMs).subscribe(
      val => {
        console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")
        this.myFullPageRefresh();
      }
    );
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.setupRefreshInterval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000);
  }
}
```

In your unit tests, you can then:

1.  Inject a mock implementation of the `setupRefreshInterval` method.
2.  Verify that the `interval` function is called with the correct time.
3.  Verify that the `myFullPageRefresh` function is called when the interval emits a value.

This approach makes the component more modular and easier to test in isolation, improving code quality and maintainability. You've decoupled the timing logic from the component itself.
