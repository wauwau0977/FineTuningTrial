For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MvcConfig.java' with name 'MvcConfig.java'... The code includes a comment "// Attention: DO NOT ADD... It will override and destroy the applicaiton properties settings // @EnableWebMvc". What is the purpose of `@EnableWebMvc`, and why is it specifically discouraged in this context?
