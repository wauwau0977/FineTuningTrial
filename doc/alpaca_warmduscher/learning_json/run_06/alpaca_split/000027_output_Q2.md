If the `AppModule` import is incorrect, the application would likely fail to start and display an error message in the browser console. The specific error message would likely be something like "Cannot find module './app/app.module'", or a similar error indicating that the module could not be resolved.  The application would essentially be unable to load the root module, which is essential for bootstrapping the application.

Here are the debugging steps I would take:

1.  **Check the Browser Console:** The first step is to inspect the browser's developer console for error messages. The error message will usually point to the missing or incorrectly referenced module.
2.  **Verify the File Path:** Carefully check the path specified in the import statement (`./app/app.module`). Ensure that the path is correct, including the file name and extension.  Pay attention to case sensitivity, which can be an issue on some operating systems.
3.  **Verify File Existence:** Double-check that the `app.module.ts` file actually exists at the specified location in the project's file system.
4.  **IDE Assistance:** Use the IDE's auto-completion and refactoring tools to verify the import path.  The IDE can often detect and highlight incorrect import statements.
5.  **Build Process:** Make sure that the project is being built correctly. Sometimes, build errors can prevent the application from loading. Run the build command again to ensure that all files are compiled and bundled properly.
6. **Inspect `tsconfig.json`:** The `tsconfig.json` file configures how TypeScript compiles your code. Verify that the `baseUrl` and `paths` settings are correct and are not interfering with the module resolution.

By systematically following these steps, I would be able to identify and resolve the incorrect import statement and get the application running.
