For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/Profiles.java' with name 'Profiles.java'... 
If a developer mistakenly used the string literal "sensormock" directly within their code instead of referencing `Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK`, what challenges might this introduce, and how would you recommend addressing this issue to ensure consistency?
