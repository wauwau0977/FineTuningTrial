The conventional purpose of a `contextLoads()` method in a Spring Boot test is to ensure that the Spring application context starts up without any errors. It's a basic "smoke test" to verify that the core application infrastructure is functioning.

To verify that the application context is loading correctly, you would typically add an assertion to check that the context is accessible. A common approach is to annotate the method parameter with `@Autowired` to inject a required bean and then assert that the bean is not null. Hereâ€™s an example:

```java
   @Test
   public void contextLoads() {
       // Assuming you have a service named MyService in your application
       // and you want to verify that it's loaded correctly.
       // You'd need to replace MyService with a real service in your application.
       
       // Inject a required bean
       // @Autowired
       // private MyService myService;

       // Assert that the bean is not null.
       // assertNotNull(myService);
   }
```

Alternatively, you could simply rely on Spring throwing an exception if the context fails to load, but explicitly asserting the existence of a required bean provides more specific feedback if something goes wrong.
