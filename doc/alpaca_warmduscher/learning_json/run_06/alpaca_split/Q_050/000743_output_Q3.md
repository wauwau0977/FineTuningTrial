The purpose of adding a `StringHttpMessageConverter` with `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` to the `RestTemplate` is to explicitly specify the character encoding for the HTTP response body.

Without this, `RestTemplate` defaults to using the platform's default character encoding (often ISO-8859-1). If the MeteoSwiss API returns data encoded in UTF-8 (which is highly likely for internationalized data), this can lead to incorrect character decoding, resulting in garbled or unreadable strings.  Characters outside the ISO-8859-1 character set would be displayed incorrectly.

UTF-8 is chosen as the character encoding because it is a widely adopted standard for representing Unicode characters. It is a variable-width encoding capable of representing virtually all characters in all languages. It's the dominant character encoding on the web and is a safe and reliable choice for handling text data from external sources like the MeteoSwiss API. Explicitly setting it ensures the data is decoded correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
