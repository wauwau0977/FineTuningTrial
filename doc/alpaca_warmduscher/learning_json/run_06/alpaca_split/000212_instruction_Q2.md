For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts' with name 'heating-data.service.spec.ts'... 
Imagine that the `HeatingDataService` relies on another service, `DataStorageService`, to fetch data. How would you mock the `DataStorageService` in your unit tests for `HeatingDataService` to isolate the testing of `HeatingDataService`'s logic?  Assume `DataStorageService` has a method `fetchData()` that returns an Observable.
