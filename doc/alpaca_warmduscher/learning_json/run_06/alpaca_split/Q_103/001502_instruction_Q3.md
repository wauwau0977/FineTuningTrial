For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' with name 'HeatingModbusReadServiceTest.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(65535), -1);
assertEquals(HeatingModbusReadService.getSignedNumber(65534), -2);
```
What is the purpose of these assertions in the test case, and what does it suggest about how the `getSignedNumber` method handles integer values greater than 32767? Explain the likely implementation detail within `getSignedNumber` that allows this behavior.
