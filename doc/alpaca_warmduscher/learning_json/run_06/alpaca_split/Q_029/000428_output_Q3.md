The `let service: CacheService;` declaration declares a variable named `service` with the type `CacheService`. This informs TypeScript that `service` is expected to hold an instance of the `CacheService` class.  `service = TestBed.inject(CacheService);` then assigns an instance of `CacheService` to this variable. The `TestBed.inject()` method creates an instance of the service using Angular's dependency injection mechanism within the testing module, and that instance is assigned to the `service` variable.

If the `let` keyword was omitted, it would imply that `service` is a global variable. This is generally bad practice in testing, as it can lead to unintended side effects and test pollution (where one test affects the outcome of another). Without `let`, the `service` variable would be accessible and modifiable from any other test within the test suite, potentially causing tests to interfere with each other and producing unreliable results.  Using `let` creates a block-scoped variable, ensuring that each test has its own isolated instance of `service`, promoting test independence and reliability.
