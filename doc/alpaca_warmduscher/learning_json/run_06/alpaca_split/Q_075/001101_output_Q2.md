I would choose the `DEBUG` logging level. Here's my reasoning and the information I'd include:

**Reasoning:**

*   `DEBUG` level is appropriate because autowiring performed *after* initial context creation is typically a more advanced or unusual operation. It's not usually something that happens in the normal flow of the application. Therefore, it's not necessary to clutter the logs with this information in production unless someone is actively debugging.
*   `INFO` would be too verbose for normal operation. `WARN` or `ERROR` would imply a problem, which isn't necessarily the case when intentionally using late autowiring.

**Log Message:**

I would include the following information in the log message:

```
DEBUG - Autowiring bean of type: [fully qualified class name of the bean], bean name (if available): [bean name], hashcode: [System.identityHashCode(bean)]
```

**Example:**

```
DEBUG - Autowiring bean of type: com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.model.TemperatureSensor, bean name (if available): temperatureSensor, hashcode: 123456789
```

**Explanation of Information Included:**

*   **Fully Qualified Class Name:**  Essential for identifying *what* is being autowired.
*   **Bean Name (If Available):**  If the bean has a name within the Spring container, it's helpful to log it for easier tracking.
*   **Hashcode:**  Provides a unique identifier for the *specific instance* of the bean being autowired. This is useful for debugging situations where multiple instances of the same class are involved.  `System.identityHashCode()` is used rather than `bean.hashCode()` because the latter can be overridden.
