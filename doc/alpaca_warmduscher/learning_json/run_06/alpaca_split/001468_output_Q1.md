Loading numerous external font files (Roboto and Material Icons) can significantly impact initial page load performance due to the overhead of establishing multiple HTTP connections and the time taken to download and render the fonts. Each request adds latency, and browsers may render text with a fallback font until the custom fonts are downloaded, causing a "flash of unstyled text" (FOUT) or "flash of invisible text" (FOIT).

Mitigation strategies include:

*   **Font Subsetting:** Reduce the font file size by only including the characters used on the webpage.  Tools exist to create subsets of font files.
*   **Font Loading Strategies:**  Use `font-display: swap;` in the `@font-face` rules. This tells the browser to use a fallback font immediately and swap to the custom font when it's loaded, preventing FOIT.  Other options like `optional` and `fallback` provide different trade-offs between visual fidelity and performance.
*   **Font Preloading:** Use `<link rel="preload">` to instruct the browser to download critical fonts with higher priority.  This is particularly effective for fonts used in above-the-fold content.
*   **WOFF2 Format:**  Ensure the fonts are served in the WOFF2 format, which offers superior compression and performance compared to older formats like WOFF or TTF. The example already uses WOFF2.
*   **HTTP/2:** Serving the page over HTTP/2 allows multiple requests to be multiplexed over a single connection, reducing the overhead of establishing multiple connections.
*   **Caching:**  Leverage browser caching by setting appropriate `Cache-Control` headers for the font files.
*   **Consider System Fonts:** If appropriate for the design, consider utilizing system fonts, which are already available on the user's machine, eliminating the need to download fonts.
