The generic type parameters define the entity type and the primary key type for this repository. `<SessionDevice, String>` indicates that this repository manages entities of type `SessionDevice` and uses a `String` as the primary key for identifying each `SessionDevice` record in the database. This allows Spring Data JPA to generate the appropriate queries and data mapping logic based on these types. Specifically, the framework understands that the ID field in `SessionDevice` is a `String` and uses it for filtering and retrieving data.
