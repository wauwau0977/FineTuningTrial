You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

The `SessionRequest` class represents a request received from a client. It stores information about the request such as session ID, client ID, request date, path, HTTP status, processing time, IP address, and any exceptions that occurred during processing. This class is designed to be persisted in a database for auditing and analysis purposes.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionRequest.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `SessionRequest`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:**
    - Represents a client request with associated metadata.
    - Persists request information for logging and analysis.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  This class itself doesn't handle direct user input. Input data comes from the application layer when creating instances of this class. Output is the data encapsulated within the class for persistence or retrieval.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The class is a simple data holder. Its primary function is to provide a structure for storing request details. No complex logic is implemented within the class itself.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Database: The class is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table`, indicating that instances are persisted to a relational database.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** The class does not contain any explicit error handling logic. Error conditions would be handled in the application layer when creating or manipulating instances of this class.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  The class is a simple data object and should not introduce any significant performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability:** The database schema defined through the annotations can be optimized for scalability depending on the expected volume of requests.
- **Security:** The class itself does not handle any security concerns. Security considerations are the responsibility of the application layer and database configuration.
- **Maintainability:** The class is relatively simple and well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:** The reliability and availability depend on the underlying database system.
- **Usability:** The class is easy to use as a data container for request information.
- **Compliance:**  Compliance requirements are determined by the application and data retention policies.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `getId()`: Returns the unique ID of the request.
    - `setId()`: Sets the unique ID of the request.
    - `getSessionId()`: Returns the session ID.
    - `setSessionId()`: Sets the session ID.
    - `getRequestDate()`: Returns the date the request was received.
    - `setRequestDate()`: Sets the request date.
    - `getPath()`: Returns the requested path.
    - `setPath()`: Sets the requested path.
    - `getClientId()`: Returns the client ID.
    - `setClientId()`: Sets the client ID.
    - `getClientVersion()`: Returns the client Version.
    - `setClientVersion()`: Sets the client Version.
    - `getHttpStatus()`: Returns the HTTP status code.
    - `setHttpStatus()`: Sets the HTTP status code.
    - `getProcessingTime()`: Returns the processing time.
    - `setProcessingTime()`: Sets the processing time.
    - `getIp()`: Returns the client IP address.
    - `setIp()`: Sets the client IP address.
    - `getException()`: Returns the exception string
    - `setException()`: Sets the exception string.
- **Important logic flows:** None. This is a data object.
- **Error handling:** None.
- **Classes:**  No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:**  Part of the `thserver` module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Data structures (Strings, Dates, Longs)
- Annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Index`)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Used for database persistence through the `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations.
- **UUIDUtils:** External utility class for UUID generation.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly declared in the code.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** No immediate performance concerns.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Consider adding validation to the input fields to prevent potential injection attacks.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The database schema should be optimized for large volumes of data. Consider using appropriate indexing strategies and data partitioning techniques.  Also, consider the size of the `exception` field; unbounded string fields can lead to database bloat. Consider limiting the size.
