The constructor `MyStartUpListener(SpringApplication application, String[] args)` is required because the `SpringApplicationRunListener` interface implies that implementing classes must have a constructor taking a `SpringApplication` instance and an array of `String` arguments. This constructor is invoked by Spring Boot during application startup to provide the listener with access to the `SpringApplication` instance and the command-line arguments passed to the application.

In this specific implementation, the constructor simply calls `super()`. This is because the `MyStartUpListener` class doesn't have a parent class that requires initialization. The call to `super()` ensures that the constructor of the parent class (in this case, `Object`, implicitly) is called, which is standard practice in Java.  Essentially, the constructor exists to satisfy the interface contract, but doesn’t perform any additional logic at this time.  The listener doesn’t need to store the `SpringApplication` or `args` for its operation, its logic resides in the `ready` method.
