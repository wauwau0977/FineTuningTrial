For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' with name 'HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
   Double getBoilerTemp();
   Integer getCompressorHours();
   Double getHeatingIn();
   Double getHeatingOut();
   Double getSoleIn();
   Double getSoleOut();
```
What is the purpose of defining these methods as getter methods within the `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity` interface? What does this imply about how data related to these values will be stored and accessed?
