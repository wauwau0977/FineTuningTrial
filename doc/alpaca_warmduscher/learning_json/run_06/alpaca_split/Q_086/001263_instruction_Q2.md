For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/MyStartUpListener.java' with name 'MyStartUpListener.java'...
The constructor of `MyStartUpListener` accepts a `SpringApplication` object and an array of strings.  Explain why these parameters are passed to the constructor, even though they aren't used within the class. What's the design principle at play here?
