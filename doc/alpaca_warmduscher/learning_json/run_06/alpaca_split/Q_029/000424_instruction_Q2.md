For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.spec.ts' with name 'cache.service.spec.ts'... 
Consider the following snippet from the test suite: 
```typescript
 it('should be created', () => {
   expect(service).toBeTruthy();
 });
```
What does this test case assert, and what is its purpose within the overall test suite? Is this a sufficient test on its own, and if not, what additional tests would you recommend to thoroughly test the `CacheService`?
