While this approach *works*, it's not ideal and deviates from best practices. A more sensible approach would be to use a shorthand property for borders â€“ `border`.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Conciseness:** Using `border: 1px solid white;` is much more concise and readable than defining `border-color`, `border-width`, and `border-style` separately.
*   **Maintainability:** If you need to change the border style (e.g., from `solid` to `dashed`), you only need to change it in one place using the shorthand.  Separating the properties requires changing multiple lines of code.
*   **Performance:** Although the difference is likely negligible, browsers can parse and apply shorthand properties more efficiently in some cases.
*   **Readability:** Shorthand properties often make the CSS easier to understand at a glance.

In this specific case, the equivalent code would be:

```sass
mat-card
  border: 1px solid white
  margin: 12px 3px
```

The `border` shorthand implicitly sets `border-style` to `solid` if not explicitly defined. Using the shorthand improves code clarity and maintainability, which are crucial for larger projects.
