The test case `it('should be created', () => { expect(service).toBeTruthy(); });` is a basic sanity check to ensure that the `CacheService` instance has been successfully created and initialized. It verifies that the service is not `null` or `undefined`.

`expect(service).toBeTruthy();` is an assertion that checks if the value of the `service` variable is truthy. In JavaScript/TypeScript, a truthy value is any value that evaluates to `true` when converted to a boolean. This generally means that `service` is not `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `NaN`, or `false`.  In the context of this test, it’s confirming that the dependency injection system correctly created an instance of `CacheService` and assigned it to the `service` variable, indicating that the service initialization process is working as expected. It’s a minimal but important test to prevent further tests from failing due to a non-initialized service.
