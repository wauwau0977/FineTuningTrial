```java
public void requestOperation(MutexOperation<T> m) {
    try {
        // Lock acquired elsewhere (before calling this method)
        if (hooks != null) {
            hooks.before(syncedObject);
        }

        m.operateGlobalSynced(syncedObject);

    } catch (Throwable t1) {
        try {
            if (hooks != null) {
                hooks.after(syncedObject); // always call after
            }
        } catch (Throwable t2) {
            log.error("Error in after hook", t2);
        }
    } finally {
        // Lock released elsewhere (after calling this method)
    }
}
```

The `requestOperation` method utilizes the `Hooks` interface to provide extension points for pre- and post-operation logic. The `before` hook is executed *before* the `operateGlobalSynced` method is called, allowing for any necessary setup or validation to occur. Crucially, the `after` hook is always executed, even if an exception is thrown during the operation.

This is achieved through a nested `try-catch` block. The outer `try` block encloses the operation itself. If an exception occurs, the `catch` block is executed.  Inside the `catch` block, another `try` block is used to call the `after` hook.  This ensures that the `after` hook is executed regardless of whether the operation was successful or not.  A second `catch` block within the inner `try` is then used to prevent any exceptions thrown by the `after` hook itself from masking the original exception. The reason for always executing `after` hook is to guarantee cleanup actions like releasing resources or resetting states are always performed, even in error scenarios, preventing resource leaks and maintaining system integrity.
