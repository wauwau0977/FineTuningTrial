The `.myLoadingSpinner` class is designed to create a loading spinner visual element. Here's a breakdown of its styling:

*   **`position: absolute`**: This positions the spinner relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with `position` set to something other than `static`). This enables precise placement of the spinner within its container.
*   **`width: 200px`**: Sets the width of the spinner to 200 pixels.
*   **`height: 200px`**: Sets the height of the spinner to 200 pixels.
*   **`animation: fadeIn 500ms linear forwards`**:  This applies an animation named `fadeIn` to the element. 
    *   `500ms`: The animation will take 500 milliseconds to complete.
    *   `linear`: The animation will proceed at a constant speed.
    *   `forwards`:  After the animation finishes, the element will retain the final state of the animation (the last keyframe's styles).
*   **`opacity: 0`**:  Initially sets the opacity of the spinner to 0, making it completely invisible.
*   **`zoom: 0.5`**: Scales the spinner down to 50% of its original size.

The `@keyframes fadeIn` animation is crucial for controlling the spinner's appearance.  It defines three keyframes:

*   **`0%`**:  `opacity: 0` - The spinner is completely invisible at the start.
*   **`50%`**: `opacity: 0` - The spinner remains invisible at the midpoint of the animation.
*   **`100%`**: `opacity: 0.6` - At the end of the animation, the opacity is set to 0.6, making the spinner partially visible.

In essence, the spinner starts invisible, remains invisible for half of the animation duration, and then fades in to 60% opacity. This provides a subtle and delayed visual cue to indicate loading. The initial opacity of 0 combined with the keyframe setup means the spinner isn't immediately visible; it fades in after a short delay.
