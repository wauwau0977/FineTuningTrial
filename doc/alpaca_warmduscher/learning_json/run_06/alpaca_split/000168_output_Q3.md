`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` is crucial for setting up Angular's routing system. It initializes the Angular router and configures it with the application's routes. Essentially, it tells Angular how to navigate between different views or components based on the URL.

`routes` in this context is a constant array (defined earlier in the file) of `Route` objects. Each `Route` object defines a mapping between a URL path (like '/dashboard') and the component that should be displayed when that path is navigated to (like `OverviewCurrentComponent`).  `forRoot()` takes this array and uses it to build a routing table, allowing the Angular router to match incoming URLs to corresponding components and manage navigation within the application. `forRoot` should only be called once in the application, usually in the `AppModule`.
