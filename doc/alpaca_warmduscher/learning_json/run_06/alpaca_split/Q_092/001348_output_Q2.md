Setting `HttpOnly` to `false` disables a crucial security mechanism.  The `HttpOnly` flag, when set to `true`, prevents client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) from accessing the cookie.  By setting it to `false`, the cookie becomes vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Risks:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** If the application is vulnerable to XSS (e.g., an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page), the attacker can use JavaScript to access the cookie's value.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  If the cookie contains a session ID, an attacker could steal the session ID and use it to impersonate the user.  This allows them to access the user's account and perform actions on their behalf.

**Better Approach:**

The best approach is to **always set `HttpOnly` to `true`** unless there's an extremely specific and justifiable reason not to.  In this case, it's highly unlikely that there's a valid reason to disable it.

```java
cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
cookie.setMaxAge(60 * 60 * 24 * 365); // 1Y
cookie.setPath("/");
```

By enabling `HttpOnly`, you significantly reduce the risk of session hijacking and other XSS-related attacks. The primary purpose of the cookie in this filter is to track sessions; there's no legitimate need for client-side JavaScript to access its value.
