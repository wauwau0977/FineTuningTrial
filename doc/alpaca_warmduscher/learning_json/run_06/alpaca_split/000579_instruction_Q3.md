For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass' with name 'overview-current.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```sass
.textBig
 margin-bottom: 1px
```
What effect does applying the class `.textBig` to an element have on its presentation, and what might be the intention behind using a bottom margin of only 1px?
