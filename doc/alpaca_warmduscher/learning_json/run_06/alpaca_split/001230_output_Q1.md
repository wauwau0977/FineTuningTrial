A default "no-op" implementation would be a class that implements the `Hooks` interface with empty method bodies:

```java
public class DefaultHooks<T> implements Hooks<T> {
    @Override
    public void before(T t) throws Throwable {
        // Do nothing
    }

    @Override
    public void after(T t) throws Throwable {
        // Do nothing
    }
}
```

**Benefits of providing such an implementation:**

*   **Simplified Usage:** Clients can use the mutex without *requiring* hook implementations if they don't need them. They can simply pass an instance of `DefaultHooks` or rely on the mutex using a default instance internally.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:**  Avoids the need for clients to write empty implementations every time they want to use the mutex without custom hooks.
*   **Improved Testability:** Makes it easier to write basic unit tests for the mutex without needing to create mock hook implementations.
*   **Graceful Degradation:**  Allows the system to continue functioning even if hook implementations are not available or encounter errors.  Instead of throwing an exception if no hook is provided, the mutex can use the default implementation, preventing unexpected failures.
*   **Configuration Flexibility**: It can serve as a sensible default value in configurations.

Providing this default implementation promotes ease of use and flexibility without compromising the ability to add custom hook behavior when needed.
