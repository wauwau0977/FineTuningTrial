When designing the concrete implementation of `getDayOfWeekText()`, handling different locales (languages) requires careful consideration to ensure the correct day-of-week name is displayed for each user. Here are several key considerations:

1.  **Localization Resources:**  Store the day-of-week names in resource bundles (e.g., `.properties` files) specific to each locale.  This separates the text from the code and makes it easier to maintain and update translations.

2.  **Locale Handling:**  The concrete implementation should accept a `Locale` object (from `java.util.Locale`) as input, either through the constructor or a method parameter. This allows the caller to specify the desired locale.

3.  **Resource Lookup:** Use the `ResourceBundle` class to load the appropriate resource bundle based on the provided `Locale`. Then, retrieve the day-of-week name using the day-of-week identifier as the key.

4.  **Default Locale:**  Define a default locale to use if the requested locale is not supported or if the user's locale is not specified.

5.  **Caching:** Consider caching the localized day-of-week names to improve performance, especially if the interface is accessed frequently.

6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the implementation with different locales to ensure that the correct day-of-week names are displayed for each language.

Example (Conceptual):

```java
public class BoilerStatsByDayOfWeekImpl implements BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek {

  private final Locale locale;

  public BoilerStatsByDayOfWeekImpl(Locale locale) {
    this.locale = locale;
  }

  @Override
  public String getDayOfWeekText() {
    ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("messages", locale); // messages.properties
    return bundle.getString("dayOfWeek." + dayOfWeekStartingMonday);
  }
}
```

Where `messages.properties` might contain:

```properties
dayOfWeek.1=Monday
dayOfWeek.2=Tuesday
dayOfWeek.3=Wednesday
# ... and so on for other days and locales
```
