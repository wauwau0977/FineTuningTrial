For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplicationTests.java' with name 'ThserverApplicationTests.java' we have the following question: 
Explain how the `@SpringBootTest` annotation impacts the execution of the `ThserverApplicationTests` class. Detail what initialization steps are performed when this annotation is present, and how it differs from using a simpler test annotation like `@Test` alone.
