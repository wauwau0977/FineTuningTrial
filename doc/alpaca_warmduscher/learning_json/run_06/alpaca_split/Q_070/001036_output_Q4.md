```java
@Component
public class HeatingDataPoller {
    // ... (other fields and constructor) ...

    @Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}", initialDelay = 0)
    public void pollData() {
        long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
        HeatPumpEntity heatPumpEntity;

        try {
            heatPumpEntity = heatingDataReadService.getData();
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            String msg = "Exception while reading data from ModBus or MockService.";
            log.error(msg, e);
            throw new RuntimeException(msg, e);
        }

        heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity);
        log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0));
    }
}
```

The `pollData` method is the core logic of the `HeatingDataPoller` class, responsible for periodically retrieving heating data and persisting it to the database.

**Execution Scheduling:** The `@Scheduled` annotation configures this method to run periodically.  `fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}"` defines the interval between executions. It reads the value from the `thserver.pollingInterval` property (likely in application.properties or application.yml). If the property isn't found, it defaults to `PT60s`, meaning every 60 seconds. `initialDelay = 0` indicates the method should start executing immediately upon application startup, with no initial delay.

**Data Retrieval:** Inside the `try` block, the method calls `heatingDataReadService.getData()`. This delegates the responsibility of fetching the heating data to another service. The `getData()` method is assumed to interact with a ModBus device or a mock service to obtain the latest data.

**Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block provides robust error handling. If any `Throwable` (exception or error) occurs during the `heatingDataReadService.getData()` call, the `catch` block is executed. It logs an error message including the exception itself using the `log.error()` method, and then re-throws the exception as a `RuntimeException`. This ensures that any issues during data retrieval are logged and propagated, potentially causing the application to alert an operator or take corrective action.

**Data Persistence:**  If `heatingDataReadService.getData()` successfully returns a `HeatPumpEntity`, the method calls `heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity)`. This utilizes a Spring Data JPA repository to persist the retrieved data into the database.  The `heatPumpRepository` is responsible for handling the database interaction, allowing the `pollData` method to remain focused on data retrieval and persistence logic.

**Logging:**  The method includes logging to track its execution. Before the data retrieval, the start time (`t0`) is recorded. After successful persistence, an informational message is logged including the elapsed time (`System.currentTimeMillis() - t0`). This provides valuable insights into the method's performance and can assist in identifying potential bottlenecks.
