The `SENSOR_MOCK` constant is used to signal whether the application should use a mock sensor implementation instead of the real Modbus or service.  This is a common pattern for testing or development where a real sensor may not be available or desirable.

Here's a conceptual example of how it might be used within the application:

1.  **Configuration:** The application likely has a configuration system (e.g., properties file, environment variable, command-line argument) where the active profile is set. This profile setting would determine the value of a variable. Let's assume the variable is called `activeProfile`.

2.  **Conditional Logic:** Within the sensor data acquisition code, there would be conditional logic based on the value of `activeProfile`.

```java
public class SensorDataAcquirer {
    private String activeProfile;

    public SensorDataAcquirer(String activeProfile) {
        this.activeProfile = activeProfile;
    }

    public double getTemperature() {
        if (Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK.equals(activeProfile)) {
            // Use mock sensor implementation
            return MockSensor.getTemperature();
        } else {
            // Use real Modbus or service
            return RealSensor.getTemperature();
        }
    }
}
```

3.  **Initialization:** When the application starts, it reads the configuration and sets the `activeProfile` variable accordingly. If the configuration specifies "sensormock", the `getTemperature()` method will use the `MockSensor` implementation. Otherwise, it will use the `RealSensor` implementation.

This allows the application to easily switch between using real and mock sensor data without modifying the core logic of the data acquisition code.  It promotes modularity and testability.
