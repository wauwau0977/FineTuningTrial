The purpose of asserting both `uuidIn.equals(uuidOut)` and `uuidIn.toString().equals(uuidOut.toString())` is to provide a more robust verification that the `toShortText` and `fromShortText` methods are correctly converting UUIDs.

While `uuidIn.equals(uuidOut)` is the primary and most important assertion, as it checks for logical equality based on the UUID's internal representation, `uuidIn.toString().equals(uuidOut.toString())` adds an extra layer of confidence.

The second assertion is not *strictly* necessary, but it is a good practice for the following reason:

*   **Serialization Consistency:** It verifies that the string representation of the UUID is also consistent after the conversion process. While `equals()` checks the underlying data, the string representation might be affected by subtle differences in formatting or encoding. This is especially important if the string representation is used for logging, storage, or communication.

If the `toShortText` and `fromShortText` methods had a bug that altered the string format of the UUID without changing its underlying value, the first assertion might pass while the second assertion would fail, revealing the issue. In essence, it provides an additional check on the correctness of the encoding and decoding process.
