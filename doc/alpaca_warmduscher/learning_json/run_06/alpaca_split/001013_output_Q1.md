To accommodate a new measurement type like humidity, I would prioritize extensibility and maintainability. I'd consider the following approaches:

1.  **Adding New Fields:** The most straightforward approach would be to add `humidity`, `humidityMin`, `humidityMax`, `humidityMeasureDate`, `humidityMeasureDateMin`, and `humidityMeasureDateMax` fields, mirroring the existing temperature and wind speed structure. This is simple for a small number of additions but can lead to a wide and unwieldy entity if many new measurement types are added in the future.

2.  **Using a Map or JSON Field:**  A more flexible approach would be to introduce a map or JSON field (e.g., `additionalMeasurements`) to store key-value pairs of measurement types and their values. This allows adding new measurements without modifying the entityâ€™s structure. However, querying and indexing data within the map can be more complex.

3.  **Creating a Separate Entity:** If the new measurement type represents a fundamentally different type of data or has its own specific attributes, it might be best to create a separate entity (e.g., `HumidityMeasurementEntity`) and establish a relationship with `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`.

**Prioritized Design Principles:**

*   **Open/Closed Principle:** Aim to modify the entity as little as possible. The preferred approach would minimize changes to existing code.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Ensure the entity remains focused on representing statistical data. If adding new measurement types significantly alters its responsibilities, consider a separate entity.
*   **Extensibility:** Choose an approach that allows easy addition of new measurement types without major code refactoring.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the new measurement data is consistent and valid.

I would likely start with adding new fields if the addition is expected to be limited. If there's a high probability of adding many more measurement types in the future, I'd lean towards using a map or JSON field for greater flexibility. However, I'd carefully evaluate the performance implications of querying data within the map.
