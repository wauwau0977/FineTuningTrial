For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java' with name 'MyRequestInterceptor.java'... 
The code uses `WebUtils.getCookie(request, MySessionFilter.TH_SERVER_SESSSION_ID)` to retrieve the session ID.  What is the potential drawback of relying solely on cookies for session management, and what alternative or complementary approaches could be considered for greater robustness and security?
