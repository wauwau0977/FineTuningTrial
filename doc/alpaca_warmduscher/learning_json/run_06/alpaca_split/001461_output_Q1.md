The `@RequestMapping` and `@ResponseBody` annotations are fundamental to making this class a RESTful API.

*   **`@RequestMapping`:** This annotation maps incoming HTTP requests to specific handler methods within the class. It defines the URL path (`/meteo-swiss`) and the HTTP method (e.g., GET) that trigger the execution of the corresponding method. For instance, `@RequestMapping("/current")` maps GET requests to `/meteo-swiss/current` to the `getCurrent` method. This is the core mechanism for defining the API endpoints.

*   **`@ResponseBody`:** This annotation indicates that the return value of the handler method should be serialized and written directly to the HTTP response body. This is crucial for RESTful APIs, where data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.  Spring's `MessageConverter`s are used to handle the serialization process.

**How they contribute to a RESTful API:**

*   **Resource-based URLs:**  The URLs defined by `@RequestMapping` (e.g., `/meteo-swiss/current`, `/meteo-swiss/lastValues`) represent resources or collections of resources in the system.
*   **HTTP Methods:** The methods used in conjunction with `@RequestMapping` (implicitly GET in this example) indicate the operation being performed on the resource (e.g., retrieving data).
*   **Data Exchange:** `@ResponseBody` ensures that the data returned by the service is formatted in a standard format (usually JSON) and sent as the response body, allowing clients to easily consume the data.
*   **Statelessness:**  The use of these annotations, along with the general principles of REST, encourages the design of a stateless service, where each request contains all the information needed to process it.
