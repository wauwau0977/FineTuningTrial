This interface directly supports analytical questions and reports focused on hourly trends and aggregates related to boiler performance or discrepancies.  Specifically:

*   **Hourly Boiler Deviation Analysis:** By examining `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` and `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`, you can determine the total amount by which the boiler temperature deviated from a target or expected value each hour. This helps identify hours with significant temperature fluctuations.
*   **Hourly Boiler Usage Patterns:**  The data could reveal patterns in how the boiler operates throughout the day. Are there peak usage hours, or consistent decreases/increases in temperature at specific times?
*   **Data Quality Monitoring:** `NumOfStatisticRecords1` indicates the volume of data contributing to the hourly statistics.  A sudden drop in this number could signal a data ingestion or processing issue.
*   **Hourly Performance Metrics:** While not directly calculating averages, the sum of differences, combined with the record count, could be used to derive approximate hourly average temperature deviations.
*   **Trend Analysis (with historical data):**  When combined with data from previous days/weeks/months, the interface facilitates identifying seasonal trends, gradual performance degradation, or anomalies in boiler behavior. For example, comparing hourly deviations across different weeks can highlight changes in efficiency.
*   **Alerting:**  Setting thresholds on the sum of differences or the record count can trigger alerts when boiler performance deviates significantly from normal.
