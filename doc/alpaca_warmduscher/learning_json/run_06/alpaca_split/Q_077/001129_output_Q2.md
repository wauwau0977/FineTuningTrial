Given the frequent execution of this method in a real-time pipeline, several performance concerns arise:

1.  **`Math.exp()` is computationally expensive:** The exponential function is relatively slow compared to basic arithmetic operations.
2.  **Repeated Calculations:** If the temperature and relative humidity are frequently the same, we are recalculating the same result repeatedly.
3.  **Object Creation/Garbage Collection:** Although minimal in this specific method, any object creation within a frequently called function can contribute to garbage collection overhead.

Here's how to address these concerns:

1.  **Caching:** Implement a caching mechanism. Store the results of previous calculations based on the input `temperature` and `relativeHumidity`. Before performing the calculation, check if the result is already in the cache. This is the most impactful optimization if the same values are frequently encountered.  Consider using a `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread safety if the pipeline is multi-threaded.

2.  **Memoization:** A specialized form of caching where the arguments to the function are used as the key.  This is well-suited for this scenario.

3.  **Profiling:** Use a profiler to identify any other performance bottlenecks within the method or the surrounding code.

4.  **Avoid Unnecessary Object Creation:**  (This is less of a concern in this specific method, but good practice).

5.  **Algorithm Optimization:**  While this formula appears to be a standard approximation, if extreme performance is critical, explore alternative (potentially less accurate) algorithms that are faster to compute.  This would require careful analysis of the accuracy trade-offs.
