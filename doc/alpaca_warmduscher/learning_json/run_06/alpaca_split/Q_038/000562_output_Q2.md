The `number` pipe is used to format numeric values into strings according to specified formatting options. The argument `'1.1-1'` defines how the `heatingEntity.boilerTemp` value should be formatted.

Specifically:
*   **`1` (before the decimal point):**  Specifies the minimum number of integer digits to display. If the number has fewer than one integer digit, it will be padded with leading zeros.
*   **`.1` (decimal precision):** Specifies that the number should be rounded to one decimal place.
*   **`-1` (minimum integer digits):** Indicates that there is no maximum number of integer digits.

Therefore, `heatingEntity.boilerTemp | number: '1.1-1'` will format the `heatingEntity.boilerTemp` value to display with at least one integer digit and one decimal place. For example:

*   `12.345` would be formatted as `12.3`
*   `5.6` would be formatted as `5.6`
*   `2` would be formatted as `2.0`

A potential drawback of this formatting approach is that it doesn't handle cases where the value of `heatingEntity.boilerTemp` is `null` or `undefined`.  This can lead to errors. Also, relying solely on string formatting can sometimes obscure the underlying numeric type, making it harder to perform calculations directly on the formatted value. A more robust solution might involve handling null/undefined values explicitly and using a separate data transformation step if calculations are required.
