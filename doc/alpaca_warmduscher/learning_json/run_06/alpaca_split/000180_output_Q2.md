The current test suite only verifies that the same ID is returned on subsequent calls *within the same test*. To verify the behavior for a new application session, we need a way to simulate that within the test environment. Because the service is likely stateful, we need to ensure we're testing against a "fresh" instance that doesn't have a cached ID from a previous "session".

Here's how to extend the test suite:

1. **Resetting the Service:** We need a way to reset the `ClientIdService` to its initial state before each test that simulates a new session. This could be done in a couple of ways:
    *   **Re-instantiate the service:** Create a new instance of `ClientIdService` within each test using `TestBed.inject()`. This effectively gives us a new service with no cached ID.
    *   **Introduce a `reset()` Method:** Add a public `reset()` method to the `ClientIdService` that clears any cached ID.  Then, call this method at the beginning of each test.
2. **Multiple "Sessions" in a Single Test:** Within a single test, we could simulate multiple sessions by:
    *   Calling `getClientId()` in the first session.
    *   Resetting the service (or getting a new instance).
    *   Calling `getClientId()` again to get a new ID.
    *   Asserting that the two IDs are different.

Here's a modified test using the re-instantiation approach:

```typescript
it("test create client id - unique per session", () => {
    const firstSessionId = TestBed.inject(ClientIdService).getClientId();
    const secondSessionId = TestBed.inject(ClientIdService).getClientId();

    expect(firstSessionId).not.toEqual(secondSessionId); //Ensure different IDs
    expect(firstSessionId).toBeTruthy();
    expect(secondSessionId).toBeTruthy();
});
```

This revised test now verifies that the service generates a new ID for each "session" (simulated by re-injecting the service), which aligns with the intended behavior.
