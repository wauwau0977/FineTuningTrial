For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/polyfills.ts' with name 'polyfills.ts'... 
The file explicitly imports 'zone.js'.  Explain the role of 'zone.js' within an Angular application, and what might happen if this import were removed or commented out?
