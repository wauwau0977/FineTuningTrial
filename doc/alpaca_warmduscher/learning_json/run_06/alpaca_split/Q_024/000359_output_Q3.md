The `.chartItem` class uses negative margins (`margin-right: -15px` and `margin-left: -15px`) to allow chart items to slightly overlap or be closer together than their default spacing would allow. This is a common technique to maximize space or create a visually condensed layout. The `display: flex` property, coupled with `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`, establishes a flex container, centering the content both vertically and horizontally within each `.chartItem`. This ensures that items within the chart are aligned neatly, even if their content varies in size. The combined effect is a tightly packed, centered layout for each chart item, potentially creating a more visually appealing or information-dense display.
