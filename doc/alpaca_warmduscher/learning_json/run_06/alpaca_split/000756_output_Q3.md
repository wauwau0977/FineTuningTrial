The code instantiates a `ConcurrentMapCacheManager`. This `CacheManager` implementation creates caches that are backed by concurrent maps (specifically `ConcurrentHashMap`). This means the cache data is stored in memory within the application's JVM.

The string "sessionDeviceCache" is the *name* of the cache being created. When you use caching annotations like `@Cacheable` in your application, you'll specify this name to indicate which cache you want to use for that particular method. For example, `@Cacheable("sessionDeviceCache")` would store the results of the method in the cache named "sessionDeviceCache".

Impact on performance:

*   **Positive:** In-memory caching with `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` is very fast for read operations, as data is readily available in the JVM's heap. This can dramatically reduce latency and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
*   **Negative:** The cache size is limited by the application's available memory. A large cache can consume a significant amount of memory. There is no persistence, so when the application restarts, the cache is emptied. This is suitable for temporary, frequently-accessed data, but not for data that needs to be retained across application restarts. Concurrent access to the cache is managed by the concurrent map, reducing contention.
