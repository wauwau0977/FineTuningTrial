The current design, while functional, is brittle. Adding new filtering criteria or grouping options requires modifying the method signature, which impacts all callers.  A better approach would be to move the filtering and grouping logic *inside* the repository layer using a more dynamic approach. Here are a few options:

1. **Builder Pattern/Query Object:** Introduce a `MeasurementQuery` class (or similar) that allows clients to specify filtering and grouping criteria via a fluent API.  This class would encapsulate all the filtering and grouping parameters, and the `getMeasurements` method would accept a `MeasurementQuery` object. This avoids changing the method signature for new criteria.

2. **Specification Pattern:**  Use a Specification pattern to define filtering rules as objects. Clients can combine these specifications to create complex filtering conditions.

3. **Dynamic SQL with a Framework:** Leverage a framework like jOOQ or Spring JDBC that allows building SQL queries dynamically based on provided criteria. This provides more control and flexibility than string concatenation.

4. **Criteria API (JPA):** If using JPA, the Criteria API allows constructing queries programmatically without using strings.

The benefit of these approaches is that they separate the query construction logic from the method signature, making it easier to add new features and maintain the code in the long run.  It also promotes better testability, as you can easily test different query configurations.
