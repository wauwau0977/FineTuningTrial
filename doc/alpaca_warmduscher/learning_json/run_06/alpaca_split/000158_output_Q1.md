`FormsModule` and `ReactiveFormsModule` both provide mechanisms for building forms in Angular, but they differ in their approach. `FormsModule` utilizes a more traditional approach based on directives and two-way data binding, where form controls are directly bound to model properties. Changes in the view update the model and vice-versa. `ReactiveFormsModule` leverages Observables and the `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `FormArray` classes, providing a more programmatic and explicit approach to form management.

The reason both are included is likely due to compatibility with existing components or libraries used within the application. Some Angular Material components or third-party libraries might depend on `FormsModule` even if the majority of the application utilizes reactive forms. Including both ensures broader compatibility and avoids potential issues.

`FormsModule` is simpler to get started with for basic forms, while `ReactiveFormsModule` offers greater flexibility, testability, and control for more complex forms, dynamic forms, or scenarios where you need to perform complex validations or manipulations of form data.  It allows for more sophisticated form logic and is often preferred for larger applications.
