The code snippet demonstrates dependency injection (DI) using a constructor.  `InfoBean infoBean` is a private final field representing a dependency of the `InfoService` class. Instead of `InfoService` creating an instance of `InfoBean` itself, it *receives* an instance through its constructor. 

This approach offers several benefits:

* **Loose Coupling:** `InfoService` isn't tightly coupled to a specific implementation of `InfoBean`. It relies on an abstraction (the `InfoBean` interface or class) which allows for easier testing (mocking) and maintenance.  Different `InfoBean` implementations could be injected without modifying the `InfoService` code.
* **Testability:** During unit testing, a mock `InfoBean` can be easily injected, allowing you to isolate and test the `InfoService` logic without relying on external resources or complex configurations.
* **Maintainability:** Changes to the `InfoBean` implementation won't necessarily require changes to `InfoService`, as long as the interface remains consistent.
* **Inversion of Control (IoC):** The framework (likely Spring, given the `@Controller` annotation) is responsible for creating and providing the `InfoBean` instance to the `InfoService`, thus inverting the control of dependency creation.

The `final` keyword ensures that the `infoBean` dependency is initialized once in the constructor and cannot be reassigned, promoting immutability and thread safety.
