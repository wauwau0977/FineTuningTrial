While `@Query` with native SQL provides flexibility, it comes with several drawbacks compared to using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or derived query methods:

*   **Database Vendor Lock-in:** Native queries tie your application to a specific database vendor (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle). If you decide to switch databases, you'll need to rewrite all your native queries. JPQL, being database-agnostic, offers better portability.
*   **Reduced Type Safety:**  Native queries donâ€™t benefit from the compile-time type checking that JPQL provides.  Errors in the SQL syntax or incorrect mappings of columns to entity fields might only be detected at runtime.
*   **Maintenance Overhead:**  Native queries require more manual effort to maintain and debug.  Any changes to the database schema might necessitate updates to the SQL queries.
*   **Security Risks:**  Directly constructing SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized. While Spring Data JPA provides some protection, you need to be extra careful.
*   **Difficulty with Refactoring:** Refactoring database schema changes can also create additional work to maintain SQL queries.
*   **Loss of JPA Benefits:** JPA provides features like caching and automatic transaction management. Native queries might not fully integrate with these features.
