For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/impl/HeatingDataReadServiceMock.java' with name 'HeatingDataReadServiceMock.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
@Component
@Profile(Profiles.SENSOR_MOCK)
public class HeatingDataReadServiceMock implements HeatingDataReadService {
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());
   private final long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis() - 1;
```
