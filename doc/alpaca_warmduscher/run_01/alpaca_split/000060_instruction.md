You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
The `MeteoDataPoller` class is a scheduled task designed to periodically fetch weather data from the `MeteoDataService`, persist it to the database using the `MeteoSwissRepository`, and log the execution time. It acts as a data ingestion point for MeteoSwiss data within the Warmduscher project.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataPoller.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MeteoDataPoller`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**:
    - Poll weather data from the `MeteoDataService` at a defined interval.
    - Persist the received data to the database using the `MeteoSwissRepository`.
    - Log the execution time of the polling process.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: Configuration for polling interval (from application properties).
    - **Outputs**: Persisted weather data in the database. Log messages indicating success or failure, including execution time.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The class is initialized, and the `MeteoDataService` is initialized within the constructor.
    2. A scheduled task (`pollData`) is executed at the configured interval.
    3. `pollData` fetches data from `MeteoDataService`.
    4. The received data (a list of `MeteoSwissEntity` objects) is saved to the database using `MeteoSwissRepository`.
    5. Execution time is logged.
    6. Error handling: If any exception occurs during data retrieval or persistence, it is logged as an error, and a `RuntimeException` is thrown.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interacts with `MeteoDataService` to retrieve weather data.
    - Interacts with `MeteoSwissRepository` to persist data to the database.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Handles exceptions that may occur during data retrieval or persistence by logging the error and re-throwing a `RuntimeException`. This ensures that errors are reported and potentially handled by a higher-level error management component.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The polling interval is configurable, allowing adjustment based on data update frequency and system load.  The goal is to retrieve and persist data without causing significant performance degradation.
- **Scalability**: The polling process is designed to be executed periodically without blocking the main application threads. Scalability depends on the performance of `MeteoDataService` and `MeteoSwissRepository`.
- **Security**: No specific security requirements are explicitly outlined in the provided code.  Security considerations would be handled by the broader application architecture (e.g., database access control).
- **Maintainability**: The class is relatively simple and well-structured, contributing to its maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The error handling and logging contribute to reliability. The polling interval ensures periodic updates, contributing to availability.
- **Usability**:  The class is intended for internal use within the application and doesn't have direct usability concerns for end-users.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are apparent from the code.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions**:
    - **`MeteoDataPoller()` (Constructor)**: Initializes the `MeteoDataService` and `MeteoSwissRepository` dependencies and calls the `init()` method of the MeteoDataService.
    - **`pollData()`**: This is the core function that fetches data from `MeteoDataService`, persists it to the database, and logs execution time.
- **Important logic flows**: The main logic flow is the scheduled execution of `pollData()`.
- **Error handling**: The `pollData()` method includes a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions during data retrieval or persistence.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The class is a component within the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.data.meteoswiss` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures (Lists).
- Logging (using SLF4J).
- Exception handling (try-catch blocks).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection, scheduling (`@Scheduled`), and component management (`@Component`).
- **SLF4J**: Used for logging.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissRepository`**:  Interface for database operations on `MeteoSwissEntity`.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.meteoswiss.MeteoSwissEntity`**:  Entity class representing the weather data.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.data.meteoswiss.MeteoDataService`**: Service for retrieving MeteoSwiss weather data.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhanecements:** Consider using asynchronous operations or a message queue to decouple data retrieval and persistence, potentially improving responsiveness.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable.  No immediate refactoring is necessary.
- **Security Improvements**: Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms if the data accessed through the service is sensitive.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Consider using a caching mechanism to reduce the load on the database and improve performance. Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures if the `MeteoDataService` becomes unavailable. Consider using a dedicated thread pool for the polling operation.
