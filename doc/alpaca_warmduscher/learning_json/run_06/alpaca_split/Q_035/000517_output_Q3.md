The `ofWebService` static method is designed to create an instance of `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` from data received from a web service. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the translation of data from an external source (the web service) into an object that can be used within the application.

It handles potentially missing data by checking if the input `data` is null. If it is, the method returns `this.emptyInstance()`, which creates and returns a default instance of the entity with pre-defined empty or default values. This prevents errors that might occur if the method tries to access properties of a null object.

The `HeatingDataService.convertDate` function is crucial for handling date formatting. It's assumed that the date format received from the web service might be different from the format expected by the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity` class. The `convertDate` function transforms the date strings received from the web service (`data.measurementDateStart` and `data.measurementDateEnd`) into `Date` objects that are compatible with the class's internal representation. This ensures data consistency and avoids potential date parsing errors. It acts as an adapter, bridging the gap between the web service's date format and the application's date format.
