The `@Scheduled` annotation is a Spring annotation that allows you to schedule methods to be executed at a fixed rate or fixed delay. In this case, it's used to periodically poll data from MeteoSwiss.

The parameters used are:

*   `fixedDelayString = "${thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval:PT900s}"`: This specifies the delay between each execution of the `pollData()` method. It reads the value from the application properties file (or environment variables) using the key `thserver.meteoSwiss.pollingInterval`. If this key is not found, it defaults to `PT900s`, which means 900 seconds (15 minutes). The 'PT' indicates a duration, and 's' indicates seconds.
*   `initialDelay = 0`: This specifies the delay before the first execution of the `pollData()` method. Setting it to 0 means the method will be executed immediately after the Spring application context is initialized.

If `meteoDataService.getData()` throws an exception, the `catch` block will be executed. The following will happen:

1.  A `String` message "Exception while reading data from MeteoSwiss" is created.
2.  The exception is logged using the `log.error()` method, including the exception itself for detailed debugging.
3.  A new `RuntimeException` is thrown, wrapping the original exception. This re-throwing of the exception will likely cause the scheduled task to stop executing and could potentially lead to the Spring application context terminating, depending on how the application handles unhandled exceptions.  The exception will also be visible in the logs, indicating a failure in data retrieval from MeteoSwiss.
