For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/heatingEntity.ts' with name 'heatingEntity.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
 static emptyInstance() {
   return new HeatingEntity(null, new Date(), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
   );
 }
```
What is the purpose of the `static` keyword used before the `emptyInstance()` method? How is this method intended to be used?
