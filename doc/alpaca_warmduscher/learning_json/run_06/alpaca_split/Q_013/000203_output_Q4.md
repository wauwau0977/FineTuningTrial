The static readonly properties `KEY_CLIENT_ID` and `KEY_CLIENT_VERSION` are constants used as keys for storing client-specific data, specifically the client ID and client version, in `localStorage`.

**Static:** They are declared `static` because these keys are associated with the `ClientIdService` class itself, not individual instances of the class. This means there's only one copy of these keys regardless of how many `ClientIdService` objects are created. This makes sense because these keys should be consistent across the entire application.

**Readonly:** They are declared `readonly` to ensure that these keys cannot be accidentally modified after initialization. This helps prevent bugs and ensures that the application consistently uses the same keys for accessing client-specific data in `localStorage`.

**Significance and Role:**

*   `KEY_CLIENT_ID`: This key is used to store the unique client identifier in `localStorage`. This ID is used to distinguish different clients accessing the application, potentially for tracking, analytics, or feature flagging.
*   `KEY_CLIENT_VERSION`: While not currently used within the provided code snippet, it's likely intended to store the version of the client application in `localStorage`. This could be used to track different client releases, manage compatibility, or trigger specific behaviors based on the client version.

The use of `localStorage` for storing these keys allows the client ID and version to persist across browser sessions, providing a consistent identifier for the client over time.  The comment `// underscore not allowed by default in nginx` suggests these keys are also used in server-side configurations or routing, where underscores might be problematic.
