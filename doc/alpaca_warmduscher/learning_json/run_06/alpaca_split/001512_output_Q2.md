Simply dividing the total execution time by the number of iterations has several potential issues. It doesn't account for:

1.  **JVM Warm-up:** The initial iterations of the loop might take longer as the JVM compiles and optimizes the code. This "warm-up" period can skew the results, making the first few iterations slower than subsequent ones.
2.  **Garbage Collection:** Garbage collection cycles can interrupt the loop, adding significant and unpredictable delays.
3.  **System Load:** Other processes running on the system can interfere with the test, increasing the execution time.
4.  **Operating System Scheduling:** The OS might not give the test thread consistent CPU time.

To obtain a more accurate performance assessment:

*   **Warm-up Iterations:** Run a significant number of "warm-up" iterations *before* starting the timing measurements.  Discard these initial results.
*   **Multiple Runs:** Run the test multiple times and average the results to reduce the impact of random fluctuations.
*   **Measure CPU Time:** If possible, measure the CPU time used by the test process rather than wall-clock time.  This eliminates the impact of system load.
*   **Avoid GC During Measurement:** Use a profiling tool to identify and avoid garbage collection during the timing measurements, or consider using a dedicated garbage collection strategy during the test.
*   **Use a Profiler:** Use a Java profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
