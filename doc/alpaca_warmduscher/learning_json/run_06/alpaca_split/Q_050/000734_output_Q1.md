The `TypeRef` is used to provide generic type information to the `JsonPath.read()` method.  `JsonPath`'s `read()` method is inherently limited in its ability to infer generic types at runtime. Without `TypeRef`, the `read()` method would return an object of type `Object`, requiring manual casting, which is prone to `ClassCastException` errors if the data isn't in the expected format.

By using `TypeRef<List<String>>` and `TypeRef<List<Double>>`, we explicitly tell `JsonPath` that we expect the 'value' property to be a list of either Strings or Doubles. This allows `JsonPath` to perform the correct conversion and return a typed list directly, ensuring type safety and avoiding the need for manual casting. It ensures the returned data is the correct type, which is crucial for subsequent calculations or processing.

Without `TypeRef`, you might try using `(List<Double>) parsed.read(...)` which relies on unchecked casting. This would compile, but could fail at runtime if the JSON data doesn't match the expected type.
