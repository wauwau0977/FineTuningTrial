`AppModule` is the root module of the Angular application. Itâ€™s a class decorated with `@NgModule`, which signifies it as an Angular module.  It encapsulates all the components, directives, services, and pipes that constitute the application. It's the entry point for the Angular application's functionality. 

Importing `AppModule` is crucial to the application's startup process.  The `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` line tells Angular to use `AppModule` as the starting point for building and rendering the application.  Angular loads the declarations within `AppModule` (components, directives, pipes) and uses them to create the application's view.  Essentially, bootstrapping with `AppModule` initializes the dependency injection system, configures the application, and starts the change detection process, allowing the application to be displayed in the browser. Without `AppModule`, Angular would not know where to begin building the user interface.
