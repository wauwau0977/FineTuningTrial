`display: flex` establishes a flex container, enabling flexible layout control over its children (the buttons in this case).  `justify-content: space-around` distributes the space *around* each flex item.  This means that the space before the first item, between items, and after the last item will be equal.  The buttons themselves will be evenly spaced across the toolbar's width.

**Advantages of `space-around`:**

*   **Simple Even Distribution:** It provides a straightforward way to evenly distribute the buttons, creating a visually balanced toolbar.
*   **Automatic Spacing:** The spacing is automatically calculated based on the number of buttons, reducing the need for manual adjustments.

**Disadvantages of `space-around`:**

*   **Half-Space at Edges:**  `space-around` creates half the space between items as it does at the edges. While often visually acceptable, it’s not perfectly even distribution overall.  This can be subtly noticeable if you’re aiming for strict, mathematical evenness.
*   **Limited Control:**  It provides limited control over the exact spacing between buttons. If you need specific pixel values, you'd need to combine it with other properties or use a different layout approach.  It may be difficult to achieve a desired look and feel without potentially complex adjustments elsewhere.
*   **Responsiveness Issues:** The space created between buttons is directly proportional to the width of the toolbar. On smaller screens, the spacing might become excessively large or small, requiring adjustments via media queries.
