The `emptyInstance()` method serves as a factory method to create a default instance of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class, initialized with all properties set to zero. This is beneficial in scenarios where you need a placeholder object before actual data is available, such as initializing data structures, handling null or undefined data from a web service, or providing a default value for a field. It avoids potential errors caused by accessing properties of a null or undefined object and provides a consistent starting point for calculations or comparisons.
