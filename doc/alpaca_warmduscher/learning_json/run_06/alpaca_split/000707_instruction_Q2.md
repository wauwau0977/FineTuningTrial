For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataService.java' with name 'MeteoDataService.java'... 
The interface `MeteoDataService` defines methods `init()` and `getData()`.  Assuming this is the *only* interface available to you at this moment, and without knowing the implementation details, describe a possible high-level architecture for how a concrete implementation of this service might work, focusing on data sourcing and storage. Specifically, discuss where the data for `getData()` would likely originate and how it might be persisted.
