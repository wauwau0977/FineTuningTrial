For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts' with name 'heating-data.service.spec.ts'... 
If `HeatingDataService` had dependencies on other services (e.g., a `LoggerService`), how would you handle those dependencies in this test suite to ensure a focused and isolated unit test?
