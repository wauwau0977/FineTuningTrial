The `@Repository` annotation is a Spring stereotype annotation. It marks the `SessionRequestRepository` interface as a repository component. This annotation signals to Spring's dependency injection container that this interface should be autodetected and registered as a bean in the application context. This allows other components in the application to inject an instance of `SessionRequestRepository` (or, more accurately, a Spring-managed implementation of it) for accessing and manipulating `SessionRequest` entities in the database. It essentially tells Spring to manage the lifecycle of this data access component.
