For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass' with name 'app.component.sass'... 
Examine the following code snippet related to the button styling within `.toolbarNav`:

```sass
button
   display: flex
   flex-direction: column
   align-items: center
   width: 100%
   span
     display: block
```

What is the purpose of `flex-direction: column` and `align-items: center` in this context? How do these properties contribute to the overall layout of the buttonâ€™s content, specifically the `span` element?
