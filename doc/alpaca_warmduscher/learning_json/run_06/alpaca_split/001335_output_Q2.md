If the `TH_KEY_CLIENT_ID` or `CLIENT_VERSION` headers are missing, the `request.getHeader()` method will return `null`. This `null` value will then be assigned to the `clientId` and `clientVersion` variables.  While this won't cause an immediate runtime exception, it can lead to several issues:

1. **Data Integrity:** The `SessionRequest` entity will contain `null` values for these important fields, potentially skewing analytics or making it difficult to identify and debug issues.
2. **Downstream Logic:** If other parts of the application rely on these values being populated, they may encounter unexpected behavior or errors.
3. **Debugging Difficulty:** It becomes harder to track requests and identify client-specific issues when these identifiers are missing.

To improve robustness, you should explicitly handle the case where these headers are missing. Here's a suggested improvement:

```java
String clientId = request.getHeader(TH_KEY_CLIENT_ID);
if (clientId == null) {
    clientId = "unknown"; // Or a default value, or log a warning
    log.warn("Missing TH_KEY_CLIENT_ID header from request.");
}

String clientVersion = request.getHeader(CLIENT_VERSION);
if (clientVersion == null) {
    clientVersion = "unknown"; // Or a default value, or log a warning
    log.warn("Missing TH-KEY-CLIENT-VERSION header from request.");
}
```

This approach ensures that the `clientId` and `clientVersion` variables always have a value, preventing potential issues downstream.  Logging a warning when a header is missing helps identify clients that are not sending the required information.  Using "unknown" as a default value allows you to still track these requests, even if you can't identify the specific client.
