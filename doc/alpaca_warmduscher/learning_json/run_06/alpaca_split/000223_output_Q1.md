The `CacheService` acts as a crucial performance optimization and server load reduction mechanism. When multiple users request the same data with the same parameters, the `CacheService` intercepts these requests. If the data is already present in the cache (based on the cache key), it returns the cached response directly, avoiding the need to make an HTTP request to the server. This significantly reduces latency and server load, especially for frequently accessed data. By serving responses from the cache, the service can handle a larger number of concurrent requests without being overwhelmed.

**Potential Challenges and Solutions:**

1.  **Cache Invalidation:** Determining *when* to invalidate the cache is a complex problem. If the data on the server changes, the cache needs to be updated to prevent serving stale data. Strategies include:
    *   **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Setting a fixed expiration time for cache entries. This is simple but may result in serving stale data for a short period.
    *   **Event-Based Invalidation:**  The server sends a notification when the data changes, triggering cache invalidation on the client-side.  This requires a mechanism for communication between the server and client.
    *   **Cache Tags:** Assigning tags to cache entries and invalidating all entries with a specific tag when the underlying data changes.
2.  **Cache Size:** The cache has limited capacity. When the cache is full, entries need to be evicted. Choosing an appropriate eviction strategy (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU)) is important.
3.  **Cache Consistency:** In a distributed system, maintaining cache consistency across multiple clients can be challenging. Strategies include using a distributed cache or implementing a cache synchronization mechanism.
4.  **Cold Cache:** The first request for a particular piece of data will always result in a cache miss, requiring a request to the server. This "cold cache" scenario can impact performance. Techniques like pre-warming the cache with frequently accessed data can help mitigate this.
5. **Stale Data:** Even with TTL, there's a window where the cached data can be stale. Consider implementing a mechanism to check for data freshness on the server before serving cached data.
