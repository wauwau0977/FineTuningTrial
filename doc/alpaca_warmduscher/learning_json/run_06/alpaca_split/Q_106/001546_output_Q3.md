This test method, `testDuplicates`, aims to assess the likelihood of generating duplicate short UUIDs when repeatedly calling `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()`. It does this by generating a large number of short UUIDs (10,000 in this case) and storing them in a `HashSet`. Because a `HashSet` only allows unique elements, any attempt to add a duplicate UUID will fail. The `assertFalse(ids.contains(uuid))` assertion checks that each generated UUID is not already present in the set. If a duplicate is found, the assertion fails, indicating a problem with the UUID generation algorithm.

The comment "it's not a true evidence" acknowledges that this test doesn't *guarantee* uniqueness. While generating 10,000 unique UUIDs is a good indicator, it doesn't prove that duplicates will *never* occur. There's always a small chance that a collision could occur beyond the tested range. It's a probabilistic test â€“ it increases confidence in the uniqueness of the algorithm, but it's not a definitive proof. A truly rigorous proof of uniqueness would require a more formal analysis of the UUID generation algorithm itself.
