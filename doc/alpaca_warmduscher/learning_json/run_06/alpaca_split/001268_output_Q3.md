These imports are crucial for the functionality of `MyStartUpListener`. 

*   **`org.springframework.boot.SpringApplicationRunListener`**: This interface is implemented by `MyStartUpListener`.  Spring Boot uses `SpringApplicationRunListener` instances to allow applications to observe and participate in the startup process. By implementing this interface, `MyStartUpListener` registers itself with Spring Boot to receive callbacks during startup.

*   **`org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext`**: This interface represents the Spring application context. The `ready` method receives an instance of `ConfigurableApplicationContext` as a parameter, providing access to the application's beans and allowing the listener to interact with the context. Itâ€™s used to retrieve the `StartupData` bean.

*   **`java.time.Duration`**: This class represents a time-based amount of time, with nanosecond precision. Spring Boot passes the startup time taken as a `Duration` object to the `ready` method.  `MyStartUpListener` converts this `Duration` to milliseconds using `timeTaken.toMillis()` to store it in the `StartupData` bean.
