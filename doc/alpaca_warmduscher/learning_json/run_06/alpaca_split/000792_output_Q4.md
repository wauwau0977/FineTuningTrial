The `getMaxMeasurementDate` method retrieves the latest (maximum) `measurement_date` from the database table storing heat pump measurements.  Its primary purpose is to determine the most recent measurement without having to fetch *all* measurements, which would be inefficient.

**Implementation & Database Function:**

The method leverages a database-specific function to find the maximum value directly within the database itself. Commonly, this is achieved using the `MAX()` aggregate function in SQL.  The method likely constructs a JPQL/HQL query that selects `MAX(m.measurementDate)` from the `Measurement` entity.

Instead of loading all `Measurement` records into memory and iterating through them to find the maximum date, this approach delegates the maximum date determination to the database engine. The database is optimized for such operations and can perform this efficiently using indexes on the `measurement_date` column.

**Handling Empty Result Sets:**

The method must gracefully handle the case where the database table is empty (i.e., no measurements exist). In this scenario, the `MAX()` function would typically return `NULL`. The method must check for this `NULL` value *after* executing the query. If `NULL` is returned, the method should likely return a default `Date` object (perhaps `null` or the epoch start date) or throw a specific exception to signal that no measurements are available.
