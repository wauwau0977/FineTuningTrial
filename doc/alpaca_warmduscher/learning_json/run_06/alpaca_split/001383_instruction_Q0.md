You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a REST controller (`EmailService`) responsible for sending emails. It receives a subject and content via HTTP request parameters and utilizes a `MailSend` utility class to handle the actual email sending process. The service returns a string indicating the result of the email sending operation.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/email/EmailService.java
- **Class Name(s):** `EmailService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Send an email with a specified subject and content.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** HTTP Request with `subject` and `content` parameters. Default values are provided if parameters are missing.
    - **Output:** A String response indicating the success or failure of the email sending operation. (The exact content of the string is dependent on the implementation of the `MailSend` class).
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `EmailService` receives an HTTP request at the `/email/send` endpoint.
    2. It extracts the `subject` and `content` parameters from the request. If these parameters arenâ€™t provided, default values are used.
    3. It calls the `send()` method of the injected `MailSend` object, passing the `subject` and `content`.
    4. It returns the string result returned by the `MailSend.send()` method.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Relies on the `MailSend` utility for actual email sending. This likely involves interaction with an SMTP server.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If the `MailSend` class encounters an error while sending the email (e.g., SMTP server unavailable, invalid email address), it should return an error message, which will then be propagated to the client. The specifics of error handling are within the `MailSend` class.
    - Default values are used for missing subject/content.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The response time should be acceptable for a typical web application, ideally under 2 seconds. The actual time will be heavily influenced by the performance of the `MailSend` class and the SMTP server.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability will depend on the implementation of `MailSend` and the underlying SMTP server.  For higher scalability, consider asynchronous email sending using message queues.
- **Security**:  Ensure that the `MailSend` class handles credentials securely and prevents email injection attacks. The SMTP connection should use TLS/SSL encryption.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. The use of dependency injection makes it easier to test and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The reliability depends on the `MailSend` class and the SMTP server. Consider implementing retry mechanisms in the `MailSend` class to handle transient errors.
- **Usability**:  The API is straightforward and easy to use.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to email sending best practices (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) is crucial to prevent emails from being flagged as spam.

## 5. Key Components

- **`EmailService` Class**: REST Controller that handles incoming requests to send emails.
- **`send()` Function**: This function receives the email subject and content, and delegates the actual sending operation to the `MailSend` utility class. It also returns the result of that operation as a string.
- **`MailSend` Object**: An injected dependency responsible for handling the low-level details of email sending.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling is largely delegated to the `MailSend` class.
- **Classes**: No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**: The code forms a cohesive unit within the `thserver` project, specifically within the `web.services.email` package.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Strings
- Standard Java Libraries

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection (`@Controller`, constructor injection) and request mapping (`@RequestMapping`, `@RequestParam`, `@ResponseBody`).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.MailSend`**:  This is a custom utility class that handles the actual email sending.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: Implement asynchronous email sending using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to avoid blocking the request thread.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already quite readable. No immediate improvements are needed.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Validate email addresses to prevent injection attacks.
    - Securely store and manage SMTP credentials.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  As mentioned, asynchronous email sending is crucial for scalability. Consider using a dedicated email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for high-volume email sending.
- **Logging**: Add logging statements to track email sending requests and any errors that occur. This will aid in debugging and monitoring.
