The `plotBands` in `chartOptionsBoilerAverageTemp` are used to visually highlight specific temperature ranges on the chart, representing zones like "Aufheiz-Zone (k√ºhl)", "Aufheiz-Zone (lauwarm)", "Soll-Zone (warm)", and "Legionellen Schaltung (sehr heiss)".  These zones provide a visual indication of the boiler's operating state. The `color` property defines the background color of each zone, while the `label` provides textual information about the zone.

The `zIndex` property within each plot band controls the stacking order of the bands.  A higher `zIndex` value means the band will be drawn on top of bands with lower `zIndex` values. In this case, the `zIndex` values range from 200, ensuring the bands are drawn above the main chart series (line and area) but are ordered amongst themselves to ensure no overlapping issues. This ensures that the plot bands are clearly visible and don't obscure the data series.
