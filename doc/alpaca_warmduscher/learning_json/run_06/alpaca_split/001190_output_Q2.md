I would modify the interface as follows:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnsafeRunnable<T> {
   void run(T context) throws Exception;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Generic Type Parameter `<T>`:** I've introduced a generic type parameter `<T>` to the interface. This allows the context object to be of any type, providing flexibility.

2.  **Modified `run()` Method:** The `run()` method now accepts an argument of type `T`, representing the context object.

**Why this is beneficial:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:**  The `UnsafeRunnable` can now operate on tasks that require specific context information. This makes it more versatile and reusable.
*   **Improved Code Organization:**  Passing context as an argument makes the dependencies of the task explicit. This enhances code readability and maintainability.
*   **Testability:**  It makes the runnable easier to test, as you can provide mock context objects to simulate different scenarios.
*   **Contextual Information:** For 'Warmduscher', this allows each sensor reading operation to have its own unique context. The context could include the sensorâ€™s ID, a timestamp, configuration settings, or any other relevant data. This information can be used for logging, error handling, and data analysis.
*   **Avoids Static State/Global Variables:** It avoids the need for static state or global variables to share context information between tasks, leading to cleaner and more thread-safe code.
