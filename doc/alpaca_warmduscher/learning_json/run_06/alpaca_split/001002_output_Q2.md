Initializing `createDate` directly in the field declaration means a *new* `Date` object is created *every time* a new `MeteoSwissEntity` instance is created. This has several implications:

1.  **Lack of Control:** You lose control over the exact value of `createDate`. It will be the current timestamp at the moment of object instantiation, which may not be what you want in all scenarios (e.g., when creating entities in a test environment or restoring them from a database).
2.  **Testing Challenges:**  It makes unit testing harder. If you want to test scenarios based on a specific creation date, you'd need to use reflection to modify the field, which is considered a bad practice.  You can't easily create instances with a known, fixed `createDate`.
3.  **Persistence Issues:** When the entity is persisted to the database, the current timestamp at the time of *persistence* will be stored, not necessarily the date the entity logically represents. This could be misleading if you're trying to track the "original" creation date.
4. **Potential for Concurrency Issues:** In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads could create entities simultaneously, all with potentially slightly different timestamps, even if they happen very close together.

A better approach would be to initialize `createDate` in the constructor, allowing you to control the value or provide a default value if no date is specified. Or, consider making it transient and only set it on creation if required.
