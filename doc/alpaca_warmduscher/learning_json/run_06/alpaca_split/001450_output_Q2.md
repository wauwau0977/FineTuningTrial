The best way to approach extending the `MemoryInfo` class to include disk space information is to add new fields and corresponding getter/setter methods for disk-related metrics. However, it's crucial to consider design principles to avoid creating a monolithic class that becomes difficult to maintain. Here's how I'd approach it, along with the design principles:

**1. Add Fields:**

*   `totalDiskSpaceKb`: `long` - Total disk space in kilobytes.
*   `freeDiskSpaceKb`: `long` - Free disk space in kilobytes.
*   `availableDiskSpaceKb`: `long` - Available disk space in kilobytes (consider space reserved for system files).

**2. Add Getters and Setters:**

Implement standard getter and setter methods for these new fields, following the existing pattern in the class.

**3. Design Principles to Consider:**

*   **Open/Closed Principle:** This class should be open for extension (adding disk space info) but closed for modification (avoid changing existing memory-related logic). By adding new fields and methods, we extend the class without altering existing code.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Ensure that the `MemoryInfo` class still primarily focuses on providing memory and disk information. If the class starts to accumulate unrelated responsibilities, consider refactoring it.
*   **Interface Segregation Principle:**  If disk space reporting requires drastically different behavior than memory reporting, consider defining an interface (e.g., `SystemInfo`) and having `MemoryInfo` and a `DiskInfo` class implement it. This would promote better decoupling. However, for a simple addition like this, it's likely overkill.
*   **Favor Composition over Inheritance:** If we were modeling complex resource usage, composition (having a `DiskInfo` object *within* `MemoryInfo`) might be preferable to inheritance. But for this simple case, inheritance is acceptable.

**4. Updating `getCurrent()`:**

Modify the `getCurrent()` method to also retrieve and populate the disk space information before returning the `MemoryInfo` object.

**Example Snippet (Adding Fields):**

```java
public class MemoryInfo {
   // ... existing fields and methods ...

   private long totalDiskSpaceKb;
   private long freeDiskSpaceKb;
   private long availableDiskSpaceKb;

   // Getters and setters for disk space fields...

   public static MemoryInfo getCurrent() {
       MemoryInfo memoryInfo = new MemoryInfo();
       // ... existing memory info retrieval ...

       // Retrieve disk space info (implementation omitted)
       memoryInfo.setTotalDiskSpaceKb(/* ... */);
       memoryInfo.setFreeDiskSpaceKb(/* ... */);
       memoryInfo.setAvailableDiskSpaceKb(/* ... */);

       return memoryInfo;
   }
}
```

This approach keeps the class relatively simple and easy to understand while allowing us to extend its functionality without breaking existing code. If the requirements become more complex in the future, we can always refactor the class or introduce new classes to improve the design.
