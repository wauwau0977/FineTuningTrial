```java
@Component
public class HeatingDataPoller {
    // ... (other fields) ...

    public HeatingDataPoller(HeatingDataReadService heatingDataReadService, HeatPumpRepository heatPumpRepository) {
        this.heatingDataReadService = heatingDataReadService;
        this.heatPumpRepository = heatPumpRepository;
    }

    // ... (other methods) ...
}
```

The constructor of the `HeatingDataPoller` class is responsible for dependency injection, a core principle of Spring Framework. It receives two dependencies as arguments: `HeatingDataReadService` and `HeatPumpRepository`. These dependencies are provided by the Spring container at runtime.

**`HeatingDataReadService heatingDataReadService`:** This dependency is an instance of the `HeatingDataReadService` interface/class. The `HeatingDataPoller` relies on this service to retrieve the actual heating data. The `HeatingDataPoller` doesnâ€™t need to know *how* the data is retrieved (e.g., from a Modbus device, a mock service, or another source). It only needs to call the `getData()` method on this service. This promotes loose coupling and allows for easy swapping of data sources without modifying the `HeatingDataPoller` class.

**`HeatPumpRepository heatPumpRepository`:**  This dependency is an instance of a Spring Data JPA repository interface. Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation for this repository based on the entity and database configuration. The `HeatingDataPoller` uses this repository to persist the retrieved heating data into the database. Specifically, it calls the `save()` method on the repository to save a `HeatPumpEntity`.  This dependency abstracts away the complexities of database interaction, allowing the `HeatingDataPoller` to focus on the core business logic.

The constructor then assigns these injected dependencies to private final fields (`this.heatingDataReadService = heatingDataReadService;`, `this.heatPumpRepository = heatPumpRepository;`). Declaring these fields as `final` ensures that the dependencies are immutable after construction, promoting thread safety and preventing accidental modification.  The use of constructor injection also ensures that the `HeatingDataPoller` is fully initialized with its dependencies before being used.
