The `ofWebService` method currently handles `null` data by returning an `emptyInstance()`.  What are potential downsides to this approach, particularly if the web service could return other "empty" or invalid data structures (e.g., an object with missing properties or properties of incorrect types)? How would you improve the robustness of this method to handle such scenarios, and what considerations would you take into account when choosing an error handling strategy?
