The `getBuildTimestampServer()` method has a significant issue: it returns `this.buildTimestampServer` *immediately* after subscribing to the `heatingDataService.getServerInfo()` Observable.  The `subscribe` method is asynchronous. This means the `getServerInfo()` call might not have completed and updated `this.buildTimestampServer` *before* the function returns. Consequently, the function will likely return the initial value of `this.buildTimestampServer` (which is an empty string), rather than the value received from the server.

This can be improved in a few ways:

1. **Remove the return statement:** The `buildTimestampServer` is already being updated in the component’s `ngOnInit` method, so the return statement isn’t necessary.
2. **Use a Subject/BehaviorSubject:** Introduce a Subject or BehaviorSubject to hold the `buildTimestampServer` value.  The `getServerInfo()` call would emit the value to the Subject, and the component’s template could subscribe to the Subject to receive updates. This is more complex but decouples the data retrieval from the component's direct update.
3. **Update the template instead:** The best approach is to bind the `buildTimestampServer` property directly in the template (about.component.html).  Angular's change detection will automatically update the template when the value of `this.buildTimestampServer` changes due to the `subscribe` call.  This is the most Angular-idiomatic approach.
