For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' we have the following question: 
Write the complete constructor for the `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` class. The constructor should accept five parameters: `dayOfWeekStartingMonday` (number), `dayOfWeekText` (string), `sumBoilerDiffIncrease` (number), `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` (number), and `numOfStatisticRecords1` (number).  It should assign these parameters to the corresponding public properties of the class.
