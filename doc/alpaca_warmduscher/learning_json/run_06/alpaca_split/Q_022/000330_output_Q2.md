To effectively unit test the `AboutComponent` while isolating it from the `HeatingDataService`, I would employ the following strategy, utilizing Angular's testing utilities and potentially a mocking library like Jasmine or Sinon.js (although Jasmine has built-in mocking capabilities):

1. **Mock the `HeatingDataService`:** The key is to replace the real `HeatingDataService` with a mock implementation during the tests. This prevents actual network requests or dependencies on backend services.

2. **`TestBed` Configuration:** I'd use Angular's `TestBed` to configure the testing environment.  Specifically, Iâ€™d use `TestBed.configureTestingModule` with the `providers` array to provide the mock `HeatingDataService` instead of the real one.

   ```typescript
   import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
   import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';
   import { HeatingDataService } from '../heating-data.service';
   import { of } from 'rxjs';

   describe('AboutComponent', () => {
     let component: AboutComponent;
     let mockHeatingDataService: HeatingDataService;

     beforeEach(() => {
       mockHeatingDataService = jasmine.createSpyObj('HeatingDataService', ['getServerInfo']);
       mockHeatingDataService.getServerInfo.and.returnValue(of({ buildTimestampServer: 'mocked-timestamp' }));

       TestBed.configureTestingModule({
         declarations: [AboutComponent],
         providers: [{ provide: HeatingDataService, useValue: mockHeatingDataService }]
       }).compileComponents();

       const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AboutComponent);
       component = fixture.componentInstance;
       fixture.detectChanges(); // Trigger ngOnInit
     });

     it('should display the build timestamp from the service', () => {
       expect(component.buildTimestampServer).toBe('mocked-timestamp');
     });
   });
   ```

3. **`jasmine.createSpyObj`:**  I would use `jasmine.createSpyObj` to create a mock object that implements the `HeatingDataService` interface. This allows me to control the return values of the `getServerInfo()` method without actually calling the real service.  I would define the `getServerInfo` method on the mock object and set its return value to a mock Observable.

4. **`of()`:** I'd use `rxjs.of()` to create a mock Observable that emits a fixed value (e.g., `{ buildTimestampServer: 'mocked-timestamp' }`).  This allows me to test the component's behavior with a predictable response from the service.

5. **`detectChanges()`:** After creating the component instance, I'd call `fixture.detectChanges()` to trigger the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook and ensure that the component's logic is executed.

6. **Assertions:**  Finally, I'd write assertions to verify that the component displays the expected build timestamp based on the mock response.  For example, I could check the value of `component.buildTimestampServer`.
