Using `Integer` for `getDayOfWeekStartingMonday()` introduces potential for invalid values. While the intention is likely to represent Monday as 1, Tuesday as 2, etc., the code doesn't enforce that constraint.  An invalid integer value (e.g., 0, 8, -1) could be assigned, leading to logic errors down the line. An `enum` (e.g., `DayOfWeek`) would enforce a fixed, valid set of values, improving code robustness and readability.  Furthermore, using an `enum` provides type safety, meaning the compiler will catch errors if an invalid day is assigned. The trade-off is that an `enum` is less flexible if the representation of the day of the week were to change significantly, but for a standard week representation, it's a much safer and clearer choice.
