The `downloadFileFromURL` method is responsible for downloading a file from a given URL (`urlString`) and saving it to a specified destination file (`destination`). It utilizes Java NIO (New Input/Output) and standard I/O streams to efficiently transfer the file data.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process and the roles of each component:

1.  `URL website = new URL(urlString);`:  Creates a `URL` object representing the remote file to download.
2.  `ReadableByteChannel rbc = Channels.newChannel(website.openStream());`: Opens a connection to the URL and creates a `ReadableByteChannel`. This channel allows for efficient, non-blocking reading of data from the remote source.
3.  `FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(destination);`: Creates a `FileOutputStream` to write the downloaded data to the specified destination file.
4.  `fos.getChannel().transferFrom(rbc, 0, Long.MAX_VALUE);`: This is the core of the download process. The `transferFrom` method efficiently transfers data from the `ReadableByteChannel` (rbc) to the `FileOutputStream` (fos).  It copies all available data from the input channel to the output stream.
5.  `fos.close();`: Closes the `FileOutputStream`. This releases the resources associated with the file and ensures that any buffered data is written to disk.
6.  `rbc.close();`: Closes the `ReadableByteChannel`. This releases the resources associated with the network connection.

**Potential Risk of Not Properly Closing Channels and Streams:**

Failing to close the `ReadableByteChannel` and `FileOutputStream` can lead to several problems:

*   **Resource Leaks:**  Network connections and file handles are limited resources.  If they are not released, they remain occupied, potentially leading to exhaustion of resources and preventing other parts of the application or system from functioning correctly.
*   **File Corruption:** If the output stream is not properly closed, buffered data might not be written to the file, resulting in an incomplete or corrupted file.
*   **Network Connection Issues:** Unclosed network connections can consume server resources and potentially lead to connection limits being reached.
*   **System Instability:** In severe cases, resource leaks can contribute to system instability or crashes.
