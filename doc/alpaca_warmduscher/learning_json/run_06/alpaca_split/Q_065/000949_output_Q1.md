The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation specifies the order in which the properties of this interface should be serialized when using a JSON serialization library like Jackson. Without this annotation, the order of properties in the resulting JSON would be determined by the library's internal implementation (often alphabetical) or reflection order. This annotation guarantees a consistent order, which can be beneficial for several reasons:

*   **Readability:** Makes the JSON output more human-readable, especially for debugging or when the order is expected by a consuming application.
*   **Compatibility:** Ensures compatibility with systems that rely on a specific JSON property order.  Some older systems or custom parsers may expect properties to be in a particular sequence.
*   **Testing:** Facilitates easier unit testing of JSON serialization/deserialization by providing a predictable output format.
*   **Performance (Minor):** While generally negligible, a fixed order can *slightly* improve serialization/deserialization performance by reducing the need for dynamic property lookups.
