For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.ts'... 
The `getShowerRecommendation()` method contains a lengthy series of `if/else if` statements to determine a shower recommendation based on `heatingEntity.boilerTemp`. How could you refactor this code to improve its readability and maintainability?
