These two lines define icons used for the application. The `rel="apple-touch-icon"` tag specifies the icon used when a user adds the web application to their home screen on iOS devices. The `rel="icon"` tag specifies the general icon for the web application, used in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other places. Both are pointing to the same image file: `assets/icons/icon-192x192_non_transparent_dark.png`.

The comment "for Apple iOS, must be non-transparent" is crucial because older versions of iOS (and even some current configurations) require the Apple Touch Icon to be a non-transparent PNG image.  If a transparent image is used, the icon may not display correctly on the home screen, appearing as a blank or unexpected icon. Appleâ€™s requirements historically enforced this to ensure visual consistency and prevent unexpected rendering issues on iOS devices. Although newer versions are more tolerant, adhering to this best practice ensures broad compatibility and a polished user experience.
