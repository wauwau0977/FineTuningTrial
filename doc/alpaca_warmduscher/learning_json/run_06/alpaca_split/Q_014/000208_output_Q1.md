To handle dependencies on other services like `LoggerService` and maintain a focused, isolated unit test, I would use *mocking*.  Specifically, I’d use `spyOn()` in conjunction with `TestBed.configureTestingModule()`.

Here's how I’d approach it:

1. **Configure the Testing Module:** In `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})`, I would provide a mock implementation of the `LoggerService`.  This is done using the `providers` array:
   ```typescript
   TestBed.configureTestingModule({
     providers: [
       { provide: LoggerService, useValue: { log: jasmine.createSpy('log') } }
     ]
   });
   ```
   This creates a mock `LoggerService` where the `log` method is a Jasmine spy. This allows me to track calls to the `log` method during the test.  `useValue` is used when a simple value (like a mock object) is sufficient.

2. **Spy on the Mock:** After injecting the `HeatingDataService`, I can use `spyOn()` to further refine the mock behavior or assert that specific methods were called:

   ```typescript
   beforeEach(() => {
     TestBed.configureTestingModule({
       providers: [
         { provide: LoggerService, useValue: { log: jasmine.createSpy('log') } }
       ]
     });
     service = TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService);
   });

   it('should log an error', () => {
     // ...code that triggers logging in HeatingDataService...
     expect(service.logger.log).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });
   ```

By providing a mock implementation of `LoggerService`, I isolate the `HeatingDataService` from any external dependencies and ensure that the test focuses solely on its internal logic.  I can then verify that the `HeatingDataService` interacts with the `LoggerService` as expected by asserting that the mock's methods were called with the correct arguments.  This keeps the tests fast, predictable, and focused.
