The `Hooks<T>` parameter in the constructor of the `GlobalSynced` class represents a functional interface or a class that contains methods allowing external code to inject custom behavior *before* and *after* operations on the `syncedObject`. Itâ€™s a key mechanism for extending the functionality of `GlobalSynced` without altering its core logic.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Decoupling:** It decouples the synchronization logic (handled by the `ReentrantLock`) from any pre- or post-operation actions.

2. **Extensibility:** It enables developers to add custom logic, such as logging, auditing, validation, or data transformation, without modifying the `GlobalSynced` class itself. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

3. **Functional Interface (or Interface Implementation):**  `Hooks<T>` is likely a functional interface (or an interface with a concrete implementation provided by the user). It would define methods like `before(T syncedObject)` and `after(T syncedObject)`.

4. **Example Usage:**  A user could create a custom `Hooks` implementation that logs all operations performed on the `syncedObject`, or it could perform validation checks before the operation and error handling after. The `GlobalSynced` class would simply call the `before()` and `after()` methods on the provided `Hooks` instance, without knowing anything about the specific logic they contain.

In essence, the `Hooks` parameter implements a form of the Strategy pattern or a simple form of callback mechanism, allowing for flexible and customizable behavior without modifying the core synchronization logic.
