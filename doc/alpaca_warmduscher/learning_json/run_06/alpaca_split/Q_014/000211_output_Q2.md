```typescript
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { HeatingDataService } from './heating-data.service';
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-test-component',
  template: ''
})
class TestComponent {
  constructor(private heatingDataService: HeatingDataService) {}
  loadData() {
    this.heatingDataService.getHeatingData().subscribe();
  }
}


describe('CurrentDataService', () => {
  let service: HeatingDataService;
  let component: TestComponent;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
    service = TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService);
    component = new TestComponent(service);
  });

  it('should call getHeatingData when loadData is called', () => {
    // Spy on the getHeatingData method
    const spy = spyOn(service, 'getHeatingData');

    // Call the component's method that triggers the service call
    component.loadData();

    // Assert that the service method was called
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

This test uses `spyOn` to create a spy on the `getHeatingData()` method.  When `component.loadData()` is called, the spy will record that the method was called.  Then, `expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled()` asserts that the spy was indeed called, verifying that the service method is triggered when the component method is invoked.  The `subscribe()` is necessary to trigger the Observable and allow the spy to capture the call.
