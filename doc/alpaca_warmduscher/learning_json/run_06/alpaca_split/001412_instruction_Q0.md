You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements a RESTful API endpoint that provides general information and system memory information. It leverages Spring Boot for request handling and provides responses in a structured format. The service injects an `InfoBean` which contains general information and utilizes a static method `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` to obtain current memory usage.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/InfoService.java
- **Class Name(s):** `InfoService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: 
    - Provide general system information.
    - Provide current system memory information.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Input:** HTTP GET requests to `/info/general` and `/info/memory`. No request parameters are expected.
    - **Output:**
        - `/info/general`: Returns a `InfoBean` object containing general information in JSON format.
        - `/info/memory`: Returns a `MemoryInfo` object containing memory information in JSON format.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - When a request is received at `/info/general`, the `getInfo()` method returns the injected `InfoBean` instance.
    - When a request is received at `/info/memory`, the `getMemoryInfo()` method calls the static method `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` to retrieve the current memory information and returns the resulting `MemoryInfo` object.
- **External Interactions**:
    - None beyond Spring Boot's internal request handling.  It relies on the injected `InfoBean` and the `MemoryInfo` class.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - No explicit error handling is present in this code. Errors within `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` are not handled here and will likely propagate up the call stack. If `infoBean` is null, a `NullPointerException` will occur.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The service should respond quickly to requests, with minimal latency. Performance is largely dependent on the implementation of `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` and the complexity of the `InfoBean`.
- **Scalability**: The service is likely stateless and should scale horizontally well, assuming underlying dependencies (e.g., `MemoryInfo`) are also scalable.
- **Security**:  The service doesn't implement any specific security measures.  Access should be controlled by appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented elsewhere in the application.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. Dependency injection enhances testability.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The service's reliability depends on the reliability of the injected `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo`.
- **Usability**: The API is straightforward to use.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are mentioned.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `getInfo()`: Returns the injected `InfoBean` instance.
    - `getMemoryInfo()`: Returns the result of calling `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`.
- **Important logic flows**:
    - Simple request handling - routes to either `getInfo()` or `getMemoryInfo()` based on the URL.
- **Error handling**:  No explicit error handling.
- **Classes**:
    - `InfoService`: The main controller class.
    - No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:
    - This class represents a single module responsible for providing information.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Java core libraries.
- Standard data structures (objects).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Boot**: Used for dependency injection, request mapping, and RESTful API handling.
- **org.springframework.stereotype.Controller**:  Spring annotation for defining a controller.
- **org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping**: Spring annotation to map requests to specific methods.
- **org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody**: Spring annotation to indicate that the return value should be serialized to the response body.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.InfoBean`:  Holds general system information.
- `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.MemoryInfo`: Provides memory usage information.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** Investigate the performance of `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` to ensure it doesn't become a bottleneck. Consider caching memory information if appropriate.
- **Code Readability:** The code is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Implement authentication and authorization to protect the API endpoints.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Ensure the `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo` implementations are thread-safe and scalable if the application is expected to handle a high load.
- **Error Handling:** Add proper error handling to catch potential exceptions (e.g., `NullPointerException` if `infoBean` is null) and return appropriate error responses to the client. Logging of errors is also recommended.
- **Testing:** Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the service and ensure it behaves as expected. Consider integration tests to verify the interaction with the `InfoBean` and `MemoryInfo` dependencies.
