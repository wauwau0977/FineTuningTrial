Here's how I would modify the `ready()` method to log the application version:

```java
@Override
public void ready(ConfigurableApplicationContext context, Duration timeTaken) {
    StartupData startupData = context.getBean(StartupData.class);
    startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(timeTaken.toMillis());

    // Log the application version
    String appVersion = System.getProperty("app.version");
    if (appVersion != null) {
        System.out.println("Application Version: " + appVersion); // Or use a logger
    } else {
        System.out.println("Application Version not found."); // Or use a logger
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Retrieve the System Property:**  `String appVersion = System.getProperty("app.version");` retrieves the value of the `app.version` system property. This assumes the property is set during application startup (e.g., through command-line arguments, environment variables, or build-time processing).

2.  **Conditional Logging:** The `if (appVersion != null)` block checks if the property was actually set. This prevents a `NullPointerException` if the property is missing.

3.  **Logging Output:** Inside the `if` block, `System.out.println("Application Version: " + appVersion);` logs the application version to the console. In a production application, I would replace `System.out.println` with a proper logging framework (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) to provide more control over logging levels, destinations, and formatting.

This approach adds the functionality without significantly altering the existing code. It leverages a common mechanism (system properties) to provide the application version and integrates it seamlessly into the startup process.
