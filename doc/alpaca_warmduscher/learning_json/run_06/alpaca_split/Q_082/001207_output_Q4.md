The `getRequestIP` method attempts to identify the client's IP address from an `HttpServletRequest` object by examining various HTTP headers. These headers are often used in proxy or load balancer setups to preserve the original client's IP address.

The method iterates through a static array `IP_HEADERS` containing common header names associated with client IP addresses. For each header name:

1.  It retrieves the header value using `request.getHeader(header)`.
2.  It checks if the retrieved value is null or empty. If so, it continues to the next header.
3.  If the header value is not null or empty, it splits the value by comma and whitespace (", " or ", ") using `value.split("\\s*,\\s*")`. This handles cases where multiple IP addresses are listed in a single header, separated by commas and optional whitespace.
4.  The resulting array of IP addresses is then converted to a String using `Arrays.toString()`, and immediately returned.

If the loop completes without finding any valid headers (i.e., all headers are null or empty), the method falls back to using the remote address of the request, obtained using `request.getRemoteAddr()`. This is the IP address of the immediate client connecting to the server.  This address is placed inside an array and turned into a String using `Arrays.toString()` before being returned.

The method always returns a String representing an array of IP addresses. This String can be a simple array with one IP, or a longer array of IPs if they were found within headers.
