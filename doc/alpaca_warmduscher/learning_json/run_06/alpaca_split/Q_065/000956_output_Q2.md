The current structure, while functional, could become unwieldy if many 'sum difference' metrics are added. A better approach is to generalize the interface to support different types of differences. Here's how we could refactor:

1. **Introduce an Enum:** Define an enum to represent the different types of differences. For example:

   ```java
   public enum BoilerDifferenceType {
       DECREASE,
       INCREASE,
       // Add other difference types as needed
   }
   ```

2. **Generalize the Method:** Replace the specific methods with a single, more generic method:

   ```java
   Double getSumBoilerDifference(BoilerDifferenceType type);
   ```

This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoids creating a separate getter method for each difference type.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily accommodate new difference types without modifying the interface.  Simply add a new value to the `BoilerDifferenceType` enum.
*   **Maintainability:**  Simplifies the interface and reduces the potential for errors.

Example Usage:

```java
Double decreaseSum = stats.getSumBoilerDifference(BoilerDifferenceType.DECREASE);
Double increaseSum = stats.getSumBoilerDifference(BoilerDifferenceType.INCREASE);
```

This refactoring promotes a more flexible and maintainable design, especially if the application anticipates a growing number of 'sum difference' metrics.
