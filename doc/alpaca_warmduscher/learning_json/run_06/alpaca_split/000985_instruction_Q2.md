For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/audit/AuditLogEntity.java' with name 'AuditLogEntity.java'... 
Considering the following constructor: `public AuditLogEntity(String scope1, String scope2, String scope3, String message, String detail, String exception) { ... }`, what are the implications of not initializing the `createDate` field within this constructor? How might this affect the system, and what approaches could be taken to ensure its consistent initialization?
