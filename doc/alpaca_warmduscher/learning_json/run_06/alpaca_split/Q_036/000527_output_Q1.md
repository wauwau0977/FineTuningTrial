The primary benefits of using Angular Material components like `mat-card` over standard HTML elements are:

*   **Pre-built UI Components:** Angular Material provides a rich set of pre-built, visually appealing, and accessible UI components (like cards, buttons, dialogs, etc.) that adhere to Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. This significantly reduces development time by avoiding the need to build these components from scratch.
*   **Consistent Design:** Using a UI library ensures a consistent look and feel across the application, improving the user experience.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Angular Material components are designed with accessibility in mind, helping to create applications that are usable by people with disabilities. They include ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Many components are inherently responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Theming:** Angular Material provides a powerful theming system that allows you to customize the appearance of components to match your brand.
*   **Integration with Angular:**  Angular Material is specifically designed to integrate seamlessly with Angular, providing strong typing and data binding support.

Potential drawbacks to consider when incorporating Angular Material into a project:

*   **Bundle Size:**  Adding Angular Material increases the bundle size of your application, which can impact page load times. You can mitigate this by importing only the components you need and using tree-shaking to remove unused code.
*   **Customization Limitations:** While the theming system is powerful, it can be challenging to significantly deviate from the Material Design guidelines.  Highly customized designs might require more effort or even the creation of custom components.
*   **Learning Curve:** Developers need to learn the Angular Material API and best practices, which can take time.
*   **Dependency:**  Adding another dependency to your project introduces potential maintenance overhead. You'll need to keep the Angular Material library up-to-date with security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Styling Conflicts:** Conflicts can occur between Angular Material's default styles and your custom styles. Proper CSS specificity and encapsulation techniques are necessary to resolve these conflicts.
