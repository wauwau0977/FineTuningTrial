To accommodate filtering by heat pump ID, we need to add a new parameter to the `getHeatPumpMeasurements` method and modify the query to include a `WHERE` clause condition for the heat pump ID.

Here's the modified interface and a conceptual implementation:

```java
public interface HeatPumpRepository extends JpaRepository<HeatPumpMeasurement, Long> {

    @Query(value =
            "SELECT " +
            "   DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') as grouped_time, " + //Adapt for your DB
            "   AVG(temperature) as avg_temperature, " +
            "   AVG(humidity) as avg_humidity " +
            "FROM heat_pump_measurements " +
            "WHERE timestamp BETWEEN :measurementDateStart AND :measurementDateEnd " +
            "AND heat_pump_id = :heatPumpId " + // Added heat pump ID filtering
            "GROUP BY FLOOR(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp) / :groupEveryNthSecond) " +
            "ORDER BY timestamp " +
            "LIMIT :maxRows",
            nativeQuery = true)
    List<Object[]> getHeatPumpMeasurements(
            @Param(value = "measurement_date_start") Date measurementDateStart,
            @Param(value = "measurement_date_end") Date measurementDateEnd,
            @Param(value = "maxRows") int maxRows,
            @Param(value = "group_every_nth_second") int groupEveryNthSecond,
            @Param(value = "heatPumpId") Long heatPumpId // Added heat pump ID parameter
    );
}
```

**Explanation of changes:**

1.  **New Parameter:** A `heatPumpId` parameter of type `Long` has been added to the method signature.
2.  **Modified Query:** The SQL query has been updated to include the condition `AND heat_pump_id = :heatPumpId` in the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that only measurements associated with the specified heat pump ID are included in the results.
3. **Parameter Binding**: The `@Param` annotation is used to bind the `heatPumpId` parameter to the corresponding placeholder in the query.

This approach allows users to efficiently filter the heat pump measurements by a specific heat pump ID, providing more granular control over the data they retrieve. It is important to ensure that the `heat_pump_id` column is properly indexed in the `heat_pump_measurements` table to optimize query performance.
