The `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method uses a native SQL query to calculate heat pump statistics grouped by fixed time intervals. Let's break down the query step-by-step:

1. **Innermost Subquery (h1):**  This subquery selects `measurement_date`, `year1` (extracted year), `doy` (day of the year), `hour_of_day`, `minute_of_hour`, `day_of_week_starting_sunday`, `day_of_week_text`, and `boiler_temp` from the `heat_pump` table.  It filters the data based on a date range (`measurement_date >= :measurement_date_start` and `measurement_date <= :measurement_date_end`).  The `count(1) over ()` calculates the total number of records in the filtered dataset, which is carried forward for potential use later.

2. **Second Subquery (h2):** This builds upon the results of the first subquery. It uses window functions (`first_value`, `last_value`, `min`, `max`) to determine the earliest/latest measurement date, minimum/maximum boiler temperature for each combination of year, day of year, and hour of day. `first_value` and `last_value` along with the ordering by `minute_of_hour` give the first and last measurement within that hour, and the min/max values within the time window are also calculated. 

3. **Third Subquery (h3):** This stage introduces the core grouping mechanism using the  `group_every_nth_second` parameter.
   - `round(extract(epoch from measurement_date) / :group_every_nth_second)`:  This is the critical part. It extracts the Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) from the `measurement_date`. Then, it divides this timestamp by the `:group_every_nth_second` parameter. Finally, it rounds the result. This effectively buckets all measurements into fixed-size intervals. Measurements that fall within the same interval (defined by the rounded value) will have the same group ID.  The rounded result serves as the `groupid`.
   - The rest of the subquery selects the `groupid` along with other derived fields like `measurement_date_t0`, `measurement_date_t1`, and the min/max temperature values.

4. **Outer Query:** Finally, the outer query groups the results from the previous subquery by the `groupid` (which represents the fixed time interval).  This query calculates statistics for each interval, such as the average, minimum, and maximum boiler temperature.

**Purpose of the Query:**

The overall purpose of this query is to provide time series statistics for heat pump data, grouped into fixed-size time intervals. The `:group_every_nth_second` parameter allows for configurable granularity of the statistics. For example, a value of 60 would group data into 60-second intervals, allowing the application to track trends and anomalies over time. This is useful for monitoring heat pump performance, identifying potential issues, and optimizing energy usage.
