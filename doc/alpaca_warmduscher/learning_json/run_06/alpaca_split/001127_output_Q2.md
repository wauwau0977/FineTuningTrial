Directly copying formulas without understanding can lead to several issues. Firstly, the formula might have implicit assumptions about the units of input values (temperature in Celsius vs. Kelvin, relative humidity as a percentage vs. a fraction). Incorrect units will produce erroneous results. Secondly, the stated accuracy (0.1% in this case) might only hold within a specific range of input values; outside that range, the error could be significantly higher. Thirdly, the source of the formula might be unreliable, or the formula itself might contain errors. Finally, the formula doesn't account for altitude or other environmental factors that can affect humidity.

To mitigate these risks:

1.  **Unit Verification:**  Explicitly document the expected units for `temperature` and `relativeHumidity` (e.g., temperature in Celsius, relative humidity as a percentage between 0 and 100). Add validation checks to the method to ensure the inputs are within reasonable ranges and are of the expected type, throwing exceptions if invalid.
2.  **Range Validation:**  Determine the valid range of temperatures and relative humidities for which the formula is accurate. Implement checks to ensure inputs fall within that range, logging a warning or throwing an exception if outside.
3.  **Source Verification & Peer Review:**  Investigate the original source of the formula. Understand the derivation and assumptions. Have another developer review the implementation and the formula's context to catch potential errors.
4.  **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit tests that cover various input values, including boundary conditions and edge cases. Compare the results of this implementation to a known-good implementation or real-world data where possible.
5.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the formula's limitations, assumptions, and the expected range of validity in the method's Javadoc.
6.  **Consider Alternatives:** Explore established libraries or standards for humidity calculations. These might provide more robust and well-tested solutions.
