You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface, `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity`, defines the structure for storing heat pump statistics data. It outlines the various measurements and parameters collected from a heat pump system, providing a contract for data access and manipulation within the 'Warmduscher' project. The interface primarily serves as a data holder for historical heat pump performance, allowing for analysis, reporting, and potential predictive maintenance.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/HeatPumpStatisticsEntity.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatPumpStatisticsEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Defines the data structure for heat pump statistics.  Acts as a contract for data access and manipulation.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  The interface does not directly handle user input/output. It's a data definition. Data will be populated and read through implementing classes and related services.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The interface defines getter methods for various heat pump statistics. The implementation will handle data storage and retrieval.
- **External Interactions**: The interface doesnâ€™t have direct external interaction. Implementation classes will interact with database or other data storage mechanisms.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: No specific edge case handling is defined within the interface itself. Implementing classes must handle null values, invalid data, or database errors.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  Getter methods should be efficient for data retrieval.
- **Scalability**: The data structure should be designed to accommodate a large number of statistics records.
- **Security**:  Data stored based on this interface should be protected according to the project's security requirements.
- **Maintainability**: The interface is well-defined and should be easy to maintain and extend.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The implementation should be robust and reliable, ensuring data integrity.
- **Usability**: The interface structure is clear and self-documenting.
- **Compliance**: The data structure might need to adhere to specific industry standards or regulations depending on the application.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**: The interface defines a set of getter methods for various heat pump statistics, including:
    - `getId()`: Generates a UUID for the entity.
    - `getBoilerTemp()`: Returns boiler temperature.
    - `getCompressorHours()`: Returns compressor running hours.
    - `getHeatingIn()`/`getHeatingOut()`: Returns heating input/output temperatures.
    - `getSoleIn()`/`getSoleOut()`: Returns solar input/output temperatures.
    - `getMeasurementDate()`: Returns the date of the measurement.
    - Methods for minimum and maximum values for various measurements.
    - Methods for retrieving the status of various digital inputs.
- **Important logic flows**: No logic flow within the interface itself.
- **Error handling**: No specific error handling defined in the interface.
- **Classes**: This is an interface; implementing classes will provide the actual data.
- **Modules**: Part of the `thserver` module, specifically related to database entities.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Java Interface**: The foundation of this specification.
- **Data Types**: Primitive data types like `Double`, `Integer`, and `Date` are used to represent measurements.
- **Methods**: Java methods are used to define the data access contract.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **`java.util.Date`**: For handling date and time information.
- **`java.util.UUID`**: Used by `UUIDUtils` for generating unique identifiers.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.UUIDUtils`**:  Used by `getId()` to generate UUIDs. This dependency suggests a utility class within the project for UUID generation.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** Consider using more efficient data types if appropriate.
- **Code Readability**: The interface contains many getter methods. Grouping related statistics into sub-interfaces or using a nested class structure could improve readability.
- **Security Improvements:** Ensure that any data stored based on this interface is properly protected against unauthorized access.
- **Scalability Considerations:** For very large datasets, consider using a more scalable data storage solution and indexing strategies.
- **Adding a timestamp to the record creation/update time:** It might be useful to track the record creation time or last update time for auditing/data analysis purposes.
