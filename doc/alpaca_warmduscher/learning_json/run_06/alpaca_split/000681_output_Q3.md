The significance of setting the default TimeZone within the `main` method is to ensure that all date and time operations within the application are performed using the "Europe/Zurich" timezone. This is crucial for consistency and accuracy, especially when dealing with timestamps or scheduled events. By setting the default timezone early in the application's lifecycle, you avoid potential issues caused by the system's default timezone being different.

The commented-out alternative suggests using UTC ("UTC") instead. This is considered best practice for many applications because UTC is a time standard that is independent of any particular location and avoids ambiguity associated with daylight saving time or other local time variations.  Using UTC internally and converting to local timezones only for display is often recommended for greater portability and maintainability. The comment indicates awareness of this better practice and potentially a decision made to use a specific regional timezone for this application.
