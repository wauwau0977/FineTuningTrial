For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/MutexOperation.java' with name 'MutexOperation.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
public interface MutexOperation<T> {
   void operateGlobalSynced(T t) throws Throwable;
}
```
How might this interface be used in conjunction with a mutex (lock) to ensure thread safety? Describe the intended design pattern.
