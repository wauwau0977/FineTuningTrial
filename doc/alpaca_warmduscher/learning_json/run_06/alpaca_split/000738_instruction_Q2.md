For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataServiceImpl.java' with name 'MeteoDataServiceImpl.java'... 
Considering the `extractFromJSON` method, what potential issues could arise from directly accessing elements of the list returned by `parsed.read()` using `.get(0)`?  Explain the risks and how you might improve the code to handle these risks gracefully.  Focus specifically on what could happen if the JSON structure doesn't contain the expected data for a given `stationId`.
