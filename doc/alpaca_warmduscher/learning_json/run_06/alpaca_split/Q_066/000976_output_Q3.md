Using `Integer` instead of `int` allows for the possibility of returning `null` to indicate the absence of data, specifically when no probes are present in the sample window.  Primitive `int` cannot be `null`.  This is crucial because it provides a way to explicitly signal that the value is unknown or not applicable. If a concrete implementation of this interface has no data to report for `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`, returning `null` is a valid approach.

However, it also introduces the potential for `NullPointerException` if the consuming code doesn't handle the possibility of a `null` value correctly. Therefore, the consuming code needs to perform a `null` check before accessing or using the returned value to prevent runtime errors. Using `Integer` requires more careful handling than using a primitive `int` but offers more flexibility in representing missing or undefined data.
