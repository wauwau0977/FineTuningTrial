This suggests that the original intention was to change the color of the buttons on hover and when they have the `.active-link` class.  The fact that it's commented out implies that either the feature wasn't fully implemented, was removed due to a bug or design change, or is still planned for future implementation.

To implement this feature with good code quality and maintainability, I would:

1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Confirm with the product owner or designer if this functionality is still desired and what the exact expected behavior is (e.g., what color should be used, should the change be animated, etc.).
2.  **Remove the Comment and Implement:**  Uncomment the code. However, before doing so I would confirm that `blueviolet` is still the correct color based on design system.
3.  **Consider a CSS Variable:**  Instead of hardcoding `blueviolet`, define it as a CSS variable (e.g., `--primary-hover-color`) in a central location (like a root selector or a dedicated variables file). This makes it easy to change the color globally without having to modify the CSS multiple times.
4.  **Use a More Specific Selector:** If multiple types of buttons exist, ensure the selector is specific enough to target only the buttons you want to affect. (e.g. `.toolbar-button:hover, .toolbar-button.active-link`).
5.  **Consider Accessibility:**  Ensure the color change provides sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments. Use a color contrast checker to verify compliance with accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
