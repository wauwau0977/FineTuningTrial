I would add the logging code around the `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` call.  This provides a clear demarcation of the application's startup process.

Here's how I would implement it:

```typescript
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

const startTime = performance.now();

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err))
  .then(() => {
    const endTime = performance.now();
    const startupTime = endTime - startTime;
    console.log(`Application startup time: ${startupTime} milliseconds`);
  });
```

**Steps to ensure accurate measurement:**

1.  **Use `performance.now()`:**  This provides high-resolution timestamps, which are more accurate than `Date.now()`.
2.  **Measure from the right point:**  Start the timer *immediately before* the `bootstrapModule()` call and stop it *after* the Promise returned by `bootstrapModule()` resolves (using the `.then()` callback).  This ensures that the measurement includes the entire bootstrapping process, from the beginning of module loading to the application being fully initialized.
3. **Consider Warm-up Effects:** On initial loads, browsers may experience warm-up effects (e.g., caching, JIT compilation). For more representative measurements, run the application multiple times and average the startup times.
4. **Avoid Interference:**  Ensure that no other long-running tasks are executed before or during the measurement, as these could skew the results.
5. **Log to a Centralized Location:** Instead of just logging to the console, consider logging the startup time to a centralized logging system for monitoring and analysis.
