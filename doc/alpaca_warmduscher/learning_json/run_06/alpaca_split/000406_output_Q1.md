The `zones` array in `chartOptionsHeatingDeltaTemp` is designed to visually highlight the difference between the heating return and flow temperatures. It dynamically changes the color of the area chart based on whether the temperature difference is positive or negative.

*   **Value <= 0:** The area will be colored '#2596be' (blue).
*   **Value > 0:** The area will be colored '#be3c25' (red).

This visual cue is intended to clearly convey whether the return temperature is higher or lower than the flow temperature.  A positive delta (red) likely indicates that the heating system is effectively transferring heat, while a negative delta (blue) might indicate an issue or inefficient operation, perhaps a lack of flow or a reversed thermal gradient. It essentially creates a visual indicator of the temperature difference's direction.
