For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/SessionDeviceRepository.java' with name 'SessionDeviceRepository.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
@Repository
public interface SessionDeviceRepository extends CrudRepository<SessionDevice, String> {
}
```

What is the purpose of the `@Repository` annotation in this interface definition? How does it impact the Spring application's handling of this interface?
