`platformBrowserDynamic` and `AppModule` are both crucial components for initiating an Angular application, and they work in a specific coordinated manner.

**`platformBrowserDynamic`:** This function is part of the `@angular/platform-browser-dynamic` package.  It's a platform that provides the runtime environment necessary to run an Angular application in a web browser.  It's responsible for creating the necessary infrastructure (like the DOM manipulation and event handling) that Angular needs to render and interact with the web page. It's essentially the bridge between Angular's logic and the browser's capabilities.  Think of it as setting up the stage for the Angular application to perform.

**`AppModule`:** This is the root module of the Angular application.  Angular applications are modular, meaning they are structured into logical units called modules. The `AppModule` is the top-level module, which brings together all other modules, components, services, pipes, and directives that make up the application. It defines the application's overall structure and dependencies. It's the blueprint of the entire application.

**How they work together:**

1.  `platformBrowserDynamic()` creates an instance of the browser platform.
2.  `.bootstrapModule(AppModule)` tells the browser platform to load and initialize the `AppModule`. The platform reads the `AppModule`'s declarations, imports, providers, and bootstrap components.
3.  Angular then instantiates the root component (typically specified in the `bootstrap` array within `AppModule`).
4.  Angular's change detection mechanism starts running, rendering the initial view based on the root component's template and data.

**What would happen if either import or the call to `bootstrapModule` were omitted:**

*   **If `platformBrowserDynamic` were omitted:** The code would fail to compile.  `bootstrapModule` is a method *of* the object returned by `platformBrowserDynamic()`.  Without importing and calling `platformBrowserDynamic()`, you wouldn't have an object on which to call `bootstrapModule`.

*   **If `AppModule` were omitted:** The code would fail to compile. The `bootstrapModule` method requires a module class (like `AppModule`) to be passed as an argument.  Without importing `AppModule`, the compiler wouldn't know which module to bootstrap.

*   **If the call to `bootstrapModule` were omitted:** The application wouldn't start.  Even if you imported `platformBrowserDynamic` and `AppModule`, the Angular framework wouldn't know to initialize and render the application. The browser would simply load an empty page.  The Angular compiler will likely give a warning or error about not using the imports.
