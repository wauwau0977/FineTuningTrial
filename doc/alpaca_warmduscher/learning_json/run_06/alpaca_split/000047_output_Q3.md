`zone.js` is a crucial component of an Angular application, responsible for providing the context for change detection.  It's a JavaScript library that patches common browser APIs (like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, event listeners, and XMLHttpRequest) to intercept asynchronous operations and execute code within a defined "zone." 

Here's how it relates to change detection:

*   **Asynchronous Operation Tracking:**  Angular's change detection system needs to know when to re-evaluate the application's components and update the UI. Since many operations in a web application are asynchronous (e.g., user events, network requests, timers), Angular relies on `zone.js` to track these asynchronous operations.
*   **Zone Execution:** When an asynchronous operation completes within a zone, `zone.js` notifies Angular.
*   **Change Detection Trigger:** This notification triggers Angular's change detection mechanism, which then efficiently re-evaluates components and updates the DOM if any data has changed.

**Why is it included with the Angular CLI by default?**

Angular's change detection system *requires* `zone.js` to function correctly.  Without `zone.js`, Angular would not be able to detect changes in the application's data and update the UI accordingly. Therefore, the Angular CLI automatically includes `zone.js` in new projects to provide this essential functionality.  It provides a way to make change detection automatic and performant.
