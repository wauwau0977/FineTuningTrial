You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This code implements a utility service (`UtilsServiceService`) that calculates a time interval string (e.g., "1d", "1h", "4h") based on the number of data points and a given time range. The core functionality revolves around determining an appropriate interval to ensure that a maximum number of data points fit within a given timeframe, effectively managing data granularity for visualization or analysis.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.spec.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `UtilsServiceService`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations:** The primary operation is to calculate and return a time interval string based on the number of data points and a specified date range.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:**
        - `maxDataPoints` (number): The maximum number of data points to fit within the time range.
        - `startDate` (Date): The start date of the time range.
        - `endDate` (Date): The end date of the time range.
    - **Output:**
        - `Interval` (object): An object containing the calculated time interval string (`key`) . Example values for the `key` include "1d", "1h", "4h", "3d".
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1. The service calculates the total duration in days between `startDate` and `endDate`.
    2. Based on the total days and `maxDataPoints`, the service determines an appropriate time interval.  The logic appears to prioritize fitting `maxDataPoints` within the time range, scaling the interval as needed.
    3. The calculated interval is represented as a string (e.g., "1d", "1h") which is assigned to the `key` property of the returned `Interval` object.
- **External Interactions:** None. This code operates purely in-memory and has no external interactions with APIs, databases, or files.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** The tests cover the following edge cases:
    - Different numbers of data points (10, 200, 165, 366, 360).
    - Different time ranges (1 week, 1 year).
    - The code is tested to ensure it does not return a null value and returns a valid interval string.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The calculations are relatively simple and should execute quickly. No specific performance constraints are defined.
- **Scalability:** The code is not designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
- **Security:** No security considerations are relevant for this code.
- **Maintainability:** The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.
- **Reliability & Availability:** N/A - component is used locally.
- **Usability:** N/A - It's a utility service, so usability isn't a primary concern.
- **Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components
- **`getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(maxDataPoints: number, startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Interval`**: This function is the core logic of the service. It calculates the appropriate time interval based on the input parameters.
- **Logic Flow**:  The core logic revolves around determining an interval that accommodates the provided data point count within the specified time range. It implicitly adjusts the interval granularity (hours, days) to fit the data points.
- **Error Handling**:  The code does not explicitly handle errors, but the tests ensure it does not return null.
- **Classes**: The code defines a single class `UtilsServiceService`. There are no subclasses.
- **Modules**: The code belongs to the Angular application module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- **Date Object**: Used for representing and manipulating dates.
- **Numbers**: Used for calculating time differences and intervals.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular**: The code is part of an Angular application and utilizes Angular testing framework (`TestBed`).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None explicitly listed, but likely depends on other Angular modules within the `Warmduscher` project.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements:** The current implementation is likely sufficient for its purpose, but caching the calculated intervals could improve performance if the same input parameters are frequently used.
- **Code Readability:** The calculation logic within `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` could be extracted into separate helper functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Security Improvements:** Not applicable.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  If the application needs to handle a very large number of concurrent requests, consider using a more scalable approach, such as a dedicated service for interval calculation.
- **Test Coverage:** Add more comprehensive unit tests to cover a wider range of input parameters and edge cases, including invalid date ranges or extremely large numbers of data points. Consider using a testing framework with parameterization.
- **Interval object**: consider defining the `Interval` object interface or class in a central location, so it's used across the project.
