The interface tracks the following data types:

*   `Integer` for `dayOfWeekStartingMonday`: This suggests the day of the week is represented numerically, likely starting with Monday as 1, Tuesday as 2, etc. Using an Integer allows for easy numerical comparisons and calculations related to days of the week.
*   `String` for `dayOfWeekText`: This provides a human-readable representation of the day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday").
*   `Double` for `sumBoilerDiffDecrease` and `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`: These represent sums of differences, likely related to boiler performance. Using `Double` suggests that these differences can be fractional values, providing more precision in the calculations.
*   `Long` for `numOfStatisticRecords1`: This represents a count of records. Using `Long` instead of `Integer` suggests that the number of records could potentially be very large, exceeding the capacity of an `Integer`.

Overall, this suggests the interface is designed to track daily boiler statistics, specifically the sums of decreases and increases in some boiler-related metric, along with the number of records used to calculate those sums, and is presented with both numeric and textual representations of the day.
