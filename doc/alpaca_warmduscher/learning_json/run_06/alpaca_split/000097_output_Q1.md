When a user clicks a `mat-flat-button` with a `routerLink` directive, Angular’s router intercepts the click event. Instead of a traditional page reload, the router analyzes the `routerLink` value (e.g., "/dashboard"). It then matches this route path against the routes defined in the application's routing module.  If a match is found, the router dynamically loads the component associated with that route and displays it within the `<router-outlet>`.

The `routerLinkActive="active-link"` directive adds CSS classes to the button when the current route matches the `routerLink` value.  The CSS class "active-link" is then used to visually indicate to the user which button/route is currently active—typically by changing the button's appearance (e.g., background color, font weight). This provides a clear visual indication of the current navigation state.
