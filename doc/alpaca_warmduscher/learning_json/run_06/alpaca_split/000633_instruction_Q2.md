For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts' with name 'environment.ts'... 
Consider the following section of the code:

```typescript
// `ng build` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.
// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.
```

Explain the purpose of these comments.  What is the role of `angular.json` in this process, and how does the Angular CLI utilize this information during the build process?
