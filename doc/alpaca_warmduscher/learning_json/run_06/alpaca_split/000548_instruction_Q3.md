For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
@Output() receivedNewTHValue = new EventEmitter();
 heatingEntity: HeatingEntity = HeatingEntity.emptyInstance();
 highcharts: typeof Highcharts = Highcharts;
```

What is the purpose of the `@Output()` decorator and the `receivedNewTHValue` property, and how is it used within this component?
