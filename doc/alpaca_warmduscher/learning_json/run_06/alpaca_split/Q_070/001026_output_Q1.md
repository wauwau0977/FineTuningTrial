The purpose of measuring the duration of the `pollData` method is to understand its performance and identify potential bottlenecks. It provides insight into how long it takes to read data from the `HeatingDataReadService` and persist it using the `HeatPumpRepository`.

Beyond logging, this information could be used in several ways:

*   **Performance Monitoring and Alerting:** The duration can be tracked over time using a monitoring system (like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.).  Thresholds can be set to alert if the execution time exceeds acceptable limits, indicating potential problems with the data source, network connectivity, database performance, or code inefficiencies.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Tracking execution times helps understand how the system scales under load. This information is valuable for capacity planning and ensuring the system can handle increasing data volumes.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** If errors occur, the execution time can provide context. A suddenly increased execution time might indicate a problem with an external service or database.
*   **Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** The execution time can be used to define and measure SLOs for the data polling process.
*   **Optimization:** Long execution times can pinpoint areas in the code (either `heatingDataReadService` or `heatPumpRepository`) that need optimization.
* **Dashboards:** Visualizing this duration in dashboards can give a quick overview of system health.
