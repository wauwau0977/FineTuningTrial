For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.html' with name 'boiler-chart.component.html' we have the following question: 

Describe the purpose and functionality of the `<form>` element within the `date-selector` div. Specifically, explain the role of each input field (`matInput`) and its associated `formControlName`, as well as the purpose of the `mat-slider` and `mat-checkbox`. Detail how user interactions with these form elements affect the data displayed in the charts.
