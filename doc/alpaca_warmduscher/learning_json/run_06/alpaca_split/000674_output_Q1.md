Hardcoding the timezone to `Europe/Zurich` has several implications:

*   **Limited Flexibility:** The application will always operate using `Europe/Zurich` time, regardless of where it's deployed or the user's preferred timezone. This can lead to incorrect data interpretation and display for users in different timezones.
*   **Deployment Issues:** If the application is deployed to a region outside of Europe/Zurich, the timezone will be incorrect, leading to potential data inconsistencies.
*   **Maintainability:** If the requirement changes (e.g., a different timezone needs to be used), the code needs to be modified and redeployed.

More robust and maintainable approaches include:

1.  **Configuration-Based Timezone:**  Instead of hardcoding, read the timezone from a configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) or environment variable. This allows the timezone to be easily changed without modifying the code.  Spring Boot provides mechanisms for externalizing configuration.
2.  **User-Specific Timezone:** Allow users to specify their preferred timezone in their profile settings and use that for displaying and storing time-sensitive data. This provides the most flexibility and personalization.
3.  **UTC as the Standard:**  Store all timestamps in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) within the application and convert to the user's timezone only for display purposes. This is the most recommended approach, as it avoids ambiguity and simplifies calculations.
4.  **Detect Timezone from Deployment Environment:** In some cloud environments, the timezone can be automatically detected from the deployment environment and used accordingly.

Using a configuration file or environment variable is a good balance between flexibility and maintainability. Storing all timestamps in UTC is the most robust and recommended long-term solution.
