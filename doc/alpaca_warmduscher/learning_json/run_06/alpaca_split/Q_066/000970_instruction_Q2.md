For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java'... 
This interface defines several getter methods for data related to sole in/out delta during operation. Considering potential future requirements, what are the implications of using an interface like this versus a concrete class, and what benefits does it provide in terms of testability and maintainability? Discuss specifically how this impacts dependency injection and mocking.
