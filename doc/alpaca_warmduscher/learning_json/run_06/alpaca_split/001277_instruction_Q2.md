For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java'... 
The `StartupData` class currently only holds the startup time. If a requirement arises to store additional startup statistics, such as the number of beans loaded by Spring, how would you modify the class to accommodate this, keeping in mind potential future expansion? Consider the use of data structures and best practices for maintainability.
