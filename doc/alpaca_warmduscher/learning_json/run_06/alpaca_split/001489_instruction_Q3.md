For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplicationTests.java' with name 'ThserverApplicationTests.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
   @Test
   public void contextLoads() {
   }
```

What is the purpose of the `contextLoads()` test method in this class? What does it verify, and why is this a common first test in a Spring Boot application?
