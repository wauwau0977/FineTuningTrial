The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation serves two main purposes. First, it signals to the compiler that the interface is intended to be a functional interface. A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. Second, it allows the compiler to verify that the interface meets the criteria of a functional interface â€“ i.e., it has only one abstract method. If the interface were to be modified to include more than one abstract method, the compiler would generate an error. In this case, `UnsafeRunnable` defines a single abstract method, `run()`, making it a functional interface. This annotation allows it to be used with lambda expressions or method references, making the code more concise and readable, particularly when passing `UnsafeRunnable` instances as arguments to other methods. The `throws Exception` clause is permitted within the single abstract method definition, and the annotation remains valid.
