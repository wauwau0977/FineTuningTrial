The interface could be extended to support asynchronous/reactive programming by returning a `CompletableFuture<List<String>>` or a `Flux<String>` (if using Project Reactor). This would allow the scanning process to run in a non-blocking manner, freeing up the calling thread to perform other tasks.

The benefits are significant. The current synchronous design forces the calling code to wait until the entire scan is complete before it can proceed. An asynchronous implementation would allow for more responsive applications and improved resource utilization, especially if `maxRegister` is large. A reactive approach (using `Flux`) could also enable stream processing of the scanned registers, allowing for real-time analysis or filtering of the data as it becomes available. The interface could also incorporate a callback mechanism or a reactive stream to provide progress updates during the scan, improving user experience and monitoring capabilities. This would make the service more scalable and resilient to load spikes.
