The primary drawback of using the `StartupData` class in a multi-threaded environment is that the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field is not thread-safe. If multiple threads attempt to modify this field concurrently, a race condition can occur, leading to data corruption or incorrect values.  Specifically, the last thread to write its value will effectively overwrite the values written by other threads, leading to an inaccurate measurement. This is because read-write operations on primitive long are not atomic.

To address this issue, I would use synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety. Here are a few options:

1.  **`synchronized` keyword:**

```java
@Component
public class StartupData {
   private long startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   private final Object lock = new Object(); // Create a lock object

   public long getStartupTimeTakenInMillis() {
       return startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   }

   public void setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis) {
       synchronized (lock) { // Synchronize access to the field
           this.startupTimeTakenInMillis = startupTimeTakenInMillis;
       }
   }
}
```

This ensures that only one thread can execute the `setStartupTimeTakenInMillis` method at a time.

2.  **`AtomicLong`:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

@Component
public class StartupData {
   private final AtomicLong startupTimeTakenInMillis = new AtomicLong(0);

   public long getStartupTimeTakenInMillis() {
       return startupTimeTakenInMillis.get();
   }

   public void setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(long startupTimeTakenInMillis) {
       this.startupTimeTakenInMillis.set(startupTimeTakenInMillis);
   }
}
```

Using `AtomicLong` provides atomic operations for reading and writing the value, eliminating the need for explicit synchronization.  This is often a more performant option than using `synchronized` as it avoids the overhead of locking. `AtomicLong` is specifically designed for concurrent updates to long values.

In this scenario, using `AtomicLong` is the preferred solution as it is more efficient and simplifies the code. It guarantees thread-safe access to the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field without the need for explicit locking mechanisms.
