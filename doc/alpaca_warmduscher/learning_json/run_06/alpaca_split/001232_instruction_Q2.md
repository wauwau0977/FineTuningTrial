For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java' with name 'Hooks.java'... 
This interface defines `before` and `after` hooks. Imagine a scenario where you're using this interface to wrap database transactions. What potential benefits does using these hooks provide, specifically related to error handling and resource management, beyond simply executing code before and after the transaction? Consider how exceptions might propagate and what the hooks enable you to do about them.
