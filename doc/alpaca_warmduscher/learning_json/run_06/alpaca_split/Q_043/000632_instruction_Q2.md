For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.ts' with name 'environment.ts'... 
The following line appears in the file:

```typescript
fullPageRefreshInSeconds: 10 * 60 * 5,
```

What does this line calculate, and why might a value like this be stored in an environment configuration file? What potential issues might arise if this value were hardcoded directly into the applicationâ€™s components?
