For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts' with name 'about.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
 it('should create', () => {
   expect(component).toBeTruthy();
 });
```

What is the purpose of this `it` block and the `expect(component).toBeTruthy();` assertion? What does it verify, and why is this a common initial test case in Angular component tests?
