You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a TypeScript class, `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity`, designed to encapsulate boiler statistics for a specific day of the week. It serves as a data transfer object (DTO) or entity to hold and represent data related to boiler performance, specifically the increase and decrease in differences, and the number of statistic records for each day of the week. It provides methods for creating instances from raw data (like a web service response) and returning an empty instance.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Represent boiler statistics for a single day of the week.
    - Provide a way to create instances with default or null values.
    - Provide a method to create an instance from data received from a web service.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs:**
        - `dayOfWeekStartingMonday`: Number representing the day of the week (Monday=0, Sunday=6).
        - `dayOfWeekText`: String representation of the day of the week.
        - `sumBoilerDiffIncrease`: Number representing the sum of boiler difference increases.
        - `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`: Number representing the sum of boiler difference decreases.
        - `numOfStatisticRecords1`: Number representing the number of statistic records for that day.
        - `data`: Any object representing data received from a web service (for the `ofWebService` method).
    - **Outputs:**
        - An instance of the `BoilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity` class populated with the provided data.
        - An empty instance of the class if input data is invalid or null.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    - The constructor initializes the object with the provided values.
    - `emptyInstance()` returns a pre-defined instance with default zero/empty values.
    - `ofWebService()` checks for null input data. If null, it returns an empty instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance with the data from the input object.
- **External Interactions**:
    - The class is designed to receive data that may originate from an external web service. It doesn't directly interact with any other systems, but its data will likely be used in a UI or further processed.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - The `ofWebService()` method handles the case where the input `data` is null by returning an empty instance, preventing potential errors.  There is no explicit validation of the data types or values of the input parameters to the constructor or the `ofWebService` method.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The class is lightweight and should have minimal performance overhead. Instantiation and data access are expected to be fast.
- **Scalability**: The class itself does not present any scalability concerns. Scalability will be determined by the systems that utilize this class.
- **Security**: This class itself does not handle security concerns. Data security would be the responsibility of the systems handling the data.
- **Maintainability**: The class is simple and well-defined, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The class is reliable as it handles null input in the `ofWebService` method, preventing potential crashes.
- **Usability**: The class is easy to use, with a straightforward constructor and a method for handling web service data.
- **Compliance**: This class does not have any specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `constructor()`: Initializes the class instance with the provided data.
    - `emptyInstance()`: Returns a new instance with default values.
    - `ofWebService(data: any)`: Creates an instance from a web service response, handling null values.
- **Important Logic Flows**:
    - The core logic revolves around creating instances of the class with different sources of data. The `ofWebService` method provides a standardized way to handle data from external sources.
- **Error Handling**:
    - The class only handles null input data in the `ofWebService` method, returning an empty instance. No other error handling is implemented.
- **Classes**:
    - No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules**:
    - This class is a self-contained module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- TypeScript class syntax
- Data types (number, string)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None. This class relies on core TypeScript features only.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.  The class is self-contained and doesn't depend on any other internal project components.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements:** Not applicable given the simplicity of the class.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already relatively readable.  Adding JSDoc comments to document parameters and return values would further improve readability.
- **Security Improvements**: No specific security risks are apparent.
- **Scalability Considerations**: No scalability concerns are associated with the class itself.
- **Data Validation:** Add data validation to the constructor and `ofWebService` method to ensure that input data is valid (e.g., ensuring `dayOfWeekStartingMonday` is within the valid range of 0-6).
- **Type Safety:** Consider using a more specific type than `any` for the `data` parameter in the `ofWebService` method, if the structure of the web service response is known. This would improve type safety and reduce the risk of runtime errors.
