I would use Spring's dependency injection to inject the `StartupData` class into the target Bean. To populate the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` value after the application context has finished loading, I would implement either `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner`.  `ApplicationRunner` is preferred if you are dealing with a web application or a non-console application, while `CommandLineRunner` is better suited for console applications. Here's how it would look:

```java
// In the Bean that needs the StartupData:
@Component
public class MyBean {
    private final StartupData startupData;

    @Autowired
    public MyBean(StartupData startupData) {
        this.startupData = startupData;
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}

// Implementation using ApplicationRunner:
@Component
public class StartupTimeRecorder implements ApplicationRunner {

    @Autowired
    private StartupData startupData;

    @Override
    public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // Simulate application initialization (e.g., database connections, etc.)
        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate 2 seconds of initialization
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long startupTime = endTime - startTime;
        startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis(startupTime);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

*   **Dependency Injection:** The `@Autowired` annotation in `MyBean` ensures that an instance of `StartupData` is injected into the Bean when it's created by Spring.
*   **`ApplicationRunner` Implementation:** The `StartupTimeRecorder` component implements the `ApplicationRunner` interface. This interface provides a `run()` method that is executed *after* the entire application context has been initialized.
*   **Timing Logic:** Inside the `run()` method:
    *   I record the start time using `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
    *   I simulate application initialization with `Thread.sleep()`â€”in a real application, this would be your actual initialization code.
    *   I record the end time.
    *   I calculate the startup time and set it in the `StartupData` object using `startupData.setStartupTimeTakenInMillis()`.

Using `ApplicationRunner` guarantees that the startup time is measured *after* all Spring Beans have been initialized, providing an accurate measure of the application's startup performance.
