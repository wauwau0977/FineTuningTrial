This SASS file defines a small set of CSS rules targeting elements within an Angular component, likely `overview-current.component`. Let's break down each rule:

1.  `.myHeader ::ng-deep .mat-card-header-text`: This rule targets the `.mat-card-header-text` element *inside* an element with the class `.myHeader`.  The `::ng-deep` selector is used to bypass component view encapsulation.  Without it, styles defined in this component would *not* apply to elements inside a Material Design `<mat-card-header>` if that header is part of another component.  It sets the `margin-left` to `0` and `margin-bottom` to `10px`. This likely adjusts the spacing of the text within the card header.  The use of `::ng-deep` is deprecated and signals a potential need to revisit the component structure for better styling options (like using input properties to configure styles within the `<mat-card-header>` component, or if possible refactoring the layout).

2.  `.textBig`: This rule targets any element with the class `textBig` and sets its `margin-bottom` to `1px`. This is a simple style intended to slightly reduce the bottom margin of elements using this class, likely to fine-tune vertical spacing.

3.  `.boilerTemp`:  This rule targets elements with the class `boilerTemp` and applies a `margin-left` of `10px`.  It's likely used to create a visual separation between the label and the actual temperature value being displayed.

4.  `.spacer`:  This rule targets elements with the class `spacer` and sets the `margin-bottom` to `15px`. It adds vertical space, acting as a simple visual separator.
