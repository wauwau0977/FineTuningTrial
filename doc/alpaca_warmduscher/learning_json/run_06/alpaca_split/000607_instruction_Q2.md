The `myReload()` method fetches data from the `heatingDataService` for both MeteoSwiss historical and current data, as well as the current heating entity data.  Describe how you would improve the error handling in this method to provide more robust behavior, and what kind of logging you would include to aid in debugging. Also, what about the order in which those requests happen?
