```java
@Override
public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
    // Intentionally left empty
}

@Override
public void destroy() {
    // Intentionally left empty
}
```

The `init` and `destroy` methods are lifecycle callback methods defined by the `Filter` interface in the Java Servlet API.  They are included in the `CorsFilter` class even though they are currently empty because they provide hooks for initializing and cleaning up resources used by the filter.

Here's how they play a role in the lifecycle of a filter within a servlet container:

*   **`init(FilterConfig filterConfig)`:** This method is called *only once* when the filter is first loaded by the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty). The `FilterConfig` object provides configuration information for the filter, such as initialization parameters defined in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor or through annotations.  In the `CorsFilter`, this method is currently empty, but it could be used to:
    *   Load configuration files.
    *   Initialize database connections.
    *   Perform any other setup tasks required before the filter starts processing requests.

*   **`destroy()`:** This method is called *only once* when the servlet container is shutting down or when the filter is being unloaded. It allows the filter to release any resources it has acquired during its lifetime, such as:
    *   Closing database connections.
    *   Releasing file handles.
    *   Cleaning up any other resources to prevent memory leaks or other issues.

Even if a filter doesn't require any initialization or cleanup, it's good practice to include these methods (even if they're empty) because they provide a standard interface for managing the filter's lifecycle and can be useful in future development.  The servlet container guarantees these methods will be called at the appropriate times, providing a reliable way to manage resources.
