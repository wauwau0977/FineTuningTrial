The `init()` method is responsible for initializing the `JsonPath` configuration. Specifically, it sets the default `JsonProvider` to `JacksonJsonProvider` and the `MappingProvider` to `JacksonMappingProvider`. This configuration is crucial because `JsonPath` is a library that allows you to query JSON documents using a path-like syntax. The `JsonProvider` and `MappingProvider` define *how* the JSON is parsed and how the results are mapped to Java objects.

If these configurations were omitted, `JsonPath` would fall back to its default providers, which might not be compatible with the structure of the JSON responses from the MeteoSwiss service. This could lead to parsing errors, incorrect data extraction, or even runtime exceptions.  Using Jackson ensures that the library can correctly handle the JSON format, reliably extract the required data, and map it to the `ResDateValue` object. It provides a consistent and predictable parsing process.
