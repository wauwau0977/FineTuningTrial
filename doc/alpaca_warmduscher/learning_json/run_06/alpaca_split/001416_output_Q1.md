The `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` call is a potential performance bottleneck and scalability concern. If `getCurrent()` performs a complex or time-consuming operation to gather memory information (e.g., traversing large data structures or making system calls), it could lead to increased response times and higher CPU usage, especially under heavy load.  Each request to `/info/memory` will trigger this potentially expensive operation.

Mitigation strategies include:

*   **Caching:** Implement a caching mechanism to store the memory information for a short period. This reduces the frequency of calls to `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`.  Spring's caching abstractions could be used.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload the memory information gathering to a separate thread or asynchronous task. This prevents blocking the request thread and improves responsiveness.
*   **Optimize `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`:** Profile and optimize the implementation of `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` itself to reduce its execution time.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests to `/info/memory` from overwhelming the system.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` to identify and address any bottlenecks proactively.
