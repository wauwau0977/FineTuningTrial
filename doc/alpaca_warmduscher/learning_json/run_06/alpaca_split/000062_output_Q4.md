The Sass code defines styles for three selectors: `.myLastSpace`, `mat-card`, and `.mat-snack-bar-container`.

`.myLastSpace` is assigned a fixed `height` of `100px`.

`mat-card` elements are styled with a `border-color` of `white`, a `border-width` of `1px`, and `margin` of `12px 3px`. This implies a top and bottom margin of 12 pixels, and a left and right margin of 3 pixels.

Finally, `.mat-snack-bar-container` elements are given a `background-color` of `rgba(200,200,200)`. This sets the background to a light gray color with full opacity.
