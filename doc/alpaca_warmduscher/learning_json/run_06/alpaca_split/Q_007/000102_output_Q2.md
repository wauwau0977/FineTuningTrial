The `<router-outlet>` directive serves as a placeholder within the component's template where the Angular Router will dynamically render the template of the component that matches the current route. Essentially, it’s the entry point for routing to display different components within the application's layout. 

Removing the `<router-outlet>` would effectively break the application’s navigation.  Without it, the Router would have no place to render the components associated with the routes defined in the application’s routing module.  The user would likely see a blank screen or an error message, and navigating between routes would not function as intended. The application would become static, displaying only the content within the `app.component.html` itself, without the ability to switch views based on the URL.
