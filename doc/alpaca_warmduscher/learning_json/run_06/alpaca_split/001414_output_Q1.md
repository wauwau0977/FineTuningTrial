Dependency injection (DI) is used here to provide the `infoBean` to the `InfoService`. Instead of the `InfoService` creating a new `InfoBean` instance itself, it receives it through its constructor (`public InfoService(InfoBean infoBean)`). This is a form of constructor injection.

The benefit of DI is that it promotes loose coupling. `InfoService` doesn't need to know *how* the `InfoBean` is created or configured.  This makes the code more testable (you can mock or stub the `InfoBean` for unit tests), maintainable (changes to `InfoBean`â€™s implementation don't require changes to `InfoService`), and reusable.  The Spring framework manages the creation and injection of dependencies, typically through configuration or annotations (though not shown in this snippet, it's happening elsewhere in the application).
