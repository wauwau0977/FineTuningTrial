For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/cache/CachingConfig.java' with name 'CachingConfig.java'...  Assuming that the application 'Warmduscher' experiences increased load, potentially exceeding the available JVM heap space, what strategies could you implement, beyond simply increasing the heap size, to mitigate the impact of caching on application performance and stability?
