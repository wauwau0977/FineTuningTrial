For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...

```typescript
@HostListener('document:visibilitychange', ['$event'])
 visibilitychange() {
   console.log("document:visibilitychange called for overview-current");
   if (!document.hidden) {
     console.log("Detected reactivation of browser window. About to refresh.", new Date());
     this.myReload();
   }
}
```

What is the purpose of the `@HostListener` decorator and the `visibilitychange()` method? Explain how this code handles the application's response to the browser window becoming visible after being hidden.
