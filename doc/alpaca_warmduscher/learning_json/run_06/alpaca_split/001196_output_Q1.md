Relying solely on request headers like those in `IP_HEADERS` for determining the client's IP address is vulnerable to IP spoofing and header injection attacks.  A malicious client can manipulate these headers to report a false IP address, potentially leading to inaccurate logging, incorrect access control, or bypassing rate limiting.

Mitigation strategies include:

1.  **Prioritize `REMOTE_ADDR`:** While not foolproof, `request.getRemoteAddr()` should be considered the most trustworthy source, though it will be the IP of the last proxy in the chain, not necessarily the client.
2.  **Multiple Header Inspection with Validation:** Instead of immediately returning the first non-empty value, gather values from multiple headers.  Then, validate that the IPs reported by different headers are consistent. Discard any request if the IPs don't match or appear invalid.
3.  **Trust Forwarded Headers Conditionally:** Only trust headers like `X-Forwarded-For` if you *know* you're behind a trusted proxy or load balancer.  This requires configuration to explicitly define trusted proxies.
4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Employ a WAF to filter malicious requests and header manipulations.
5.  **Logging:** Log the values of all inspected headers for auditing and forensic analysis.
6.  **Consider using a proxy/load balancer which adds the client IP address in a reliable manner.**

It's crucial to remember that accurately determining the original client IP address in a proxied environment is complex, and a layered defense approach is necessary.
