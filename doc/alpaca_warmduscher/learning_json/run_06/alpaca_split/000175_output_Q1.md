Code duplication, even in seemingly small test cases, significantly impacts maintainability. It creates multiple points of failure; if a bug is found in the logic being tested, it needs to be fixed in *every* duplicated test.  This increases the risk of inconsistencies and makes refactoring more complex. It also violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the codebase harder to understand and reason about.

In this specific scenario, the two `it("test create client id")` tests are functionally identical.  Here are a few refactoring strategies:

1.  **Remove the duplicate:** The simplest solution is to remove one of the identical tests.  Since they perform the same assertion, a single test is sufficient.
2.  **Combine into a single test with multiple assertions:**  If the intention was to test slightly different aspects of the `getClientId()` method, we could combine the assertions within a single `it()` block, perhaps using more descriptive assertion messages. However, in this case, the assertions are identical so this is not the best option.
3.  **Parametrize the test (if more variations were needed):** If the intention was to eventually test different scenarios with the `getClientId()` method (e.g. with different initial conditions or configurations), we could use parameterized tests to run the same test logic with different input values.  This is not currently relevant, but worth mentioning as a general strategy.
