The `import` statements bring external classes into the current scope, allowing the `EmailService` class to use them without fully qualifying their names.

*   `import com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.MailSend;` imports the `MailSend` class from the specified package. This is essential because the `EmailService` class uses `MailSend` to actually send emails. Without this import, the compiler wouldn't know what `MailSend` refers to.
*   `import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;` imports the `Controller` annotation from the Spring Framework. This annotation is crucial because it marks the `EmailService` class as a Spring controller.  Spring uses this annotation to identify the class as a component that handles web requests and routes them to the appropriate methods. Without it, Spring wouldn't recognize `EmailService` as a controller.

In essence, these imports make necessary external dependencies available to the `EmailService` class, allowing it to function correctly within the Spring application. They are fundamental for dependency management and code organization.
