The `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is an Angular method that is called after Angular has fully initialized all data-bound properties of a directive (component, in this case). It is part of Angular's component lifecycle. It's a convenient place to perform initialization logic that relies on the component's input properties being set.

When `ngOnInit` is called on the `AboutComponent`, it triggers the execution of the `this.getBuildTimestampServer()` method.  This method then retrieves the server build timestamp and stores it in the `buildTimestampServer` component property.

The `ngOnInit` hook is used instead of the constructor to initiate the data retrieval because the constructor should be kept lean and focused solely on dependency injection. The constructor should *not* contain any logic that might perform asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests (which is implicitly what `this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo()` likely does). Doing so can lead to issues with change detection and potentially block the rendering of the component.

Using `ngOnInit` ensures that the component has been fully initialized *before* attempting to retrieve data from the server. Furthermore, `ngOnInit` is guaranteed to be called only once during the componentâ€™s lifecycle, while the constructor can be called multiple times under certain circumstances.  This makes `ngOnInit` the appropriate place for any initialization logic that should only run once.
