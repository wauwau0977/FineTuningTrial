The current approach of re-throwing all exceptions as `RuntimeException` is particularly problematic for long-running tasks in a multi-threaded environment. Because it's an unchecked exception, it can easily propagate up the call stack, potentially crashing the thread or leading to unexpected application termination without a graceful shutdown.  This is because unchecked exceptions don't *force* the caller to handle them, increasing the likelihood of unhandled exceptions.

Improvements include:

1. **Custom Exception Type:** Introduce a custom checked exception type, such as `UnsafeExecutionException`, that extends `Exception`.  This forces the caller to explicitly handle or declare the exception, providing better error management.
2. **Thread-Local Error Handling:**  Consider using a thread-local variable to store the exception. This allows the thread to catch the exception, log it, and potentially attempt recovery or cleanup without immediately terminating the thread. This provides more control over the error handling process within each thread.
3. **Error Reporting Mechanism:** Implement a centralized error reporting mechanism (e.g., a logging system or an error queue) to capture and track exceptions that occur in different threads.
4. **Cancellation Support:** If the long-running task supports cancellation, consider adding a mechanism to gracefully cancel the task when an exception occurs.
5. **Task-Specific Error Handling:**  If the long-running task has specific error handling requirements, consider implementing a custom error handler that can address those requirements.

By adopting these strategies, you can improve the robustness and reliability of your multi-threaded application and prevent unexpected crashes or terminations due to unhandled exceptions.  A key principle is to move away from the "fire and forget" approach of simply re-throwing `RuntimeException` and towards a more deliberate and controlled error handling strategy.
