You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines an `Interval` class and a `UtilsServiceService` service, designed to provide a standardized set of time intervals (e.g., 1 second, 5 minutes, 1 day) and a method to determine the most appropriate interval based on a desired number of data points and a time range. The service aims to help with data aggregation and visualization by dynamically selecting a suitable interval to ensure meaningful and manageable data representation.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `Interval`, `UtilsServiceService`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Define a set of standard time intervals.
    - Provide a method to retrieve the standard intervals.
    - Calculate the most appropriate interval based on a given time range and desired number of data points.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **`getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(maxDataPoints: number, start: Date, end: Date)`**:
        - **Input:** `maxDataPoints` (number), `start` (Date), `end` (Date).
        - **Output:** An `Interval` object representing the most suitable time interval.
    - **`getStandardIntervals()`**:
        - **Input:** None
        - **Output:** An array of `Interval` objects.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1.  The `getStandardIntervals()` method initializes a list of predefined `Interval` objects with various durations.
    2.  The intervals are sorted in ascending order based on their duration (in seconds).
    3.  The `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints()` method calculates the desired interval duration based on the time range and the number of desired data points.
    4.  It iterates through the sorted intervals and returns the first interval that is greater than or equal to the desired interval.  If no such interval is found, it returns the smallest interval.
- **External Interactions**: None. This service operates entirely in-memory.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Invalid `start` or `end` dates**: If either `start` or `end` is null/undefined, the smallest standard interval is returned.
    - **Zero or negative `maxDataPoints`**: The behavior is undefined (could result in division by zero or unexpected results); no specific handling is implemented.
    - **Time range equals zero**:  The smallest standard interval is returned.
    - **Very large time ranges or small `maxDataPoints`**: The largest interval may be selected.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` method should have a fast execution time as it involves a linear search through a fixed-size list of intervals.
- **Scalability**: The service is designed to handle a fixed set of intervals and is not designed for dynamic addition or removal of intervals. It should scale well for a moderate number of requests.
- **Security**: The service does not handle sensitive data and has no specific security requirements.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively well-structured and easy to understand. The use of constants for time units improves readability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The service has no external dependencies and should be highly reliable.
- **Usability**: The service provides a straightforward API for obtaining suitable time intervals.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are identified.

## 5. Key Components

- **`Interval` Class**: Represents a time interval with a key, name, and duration in seconds.
    - **`constructor(key: string, name: string, intervalInSeconds: number)`**: Creates a new `Interval` object.
    - **`compare(a: Interval, b: Interval): number`**: Static method to compare two intervals based on their duration.
    - **`sort(intervals: Interval[])`**: Static method to sort an array of intervals in ascending order based on their duration.
- **`UtilsServiceService` Class**: Provides methods for obtaining standard intervals and calculating suitable intervals based on data requirements.
    - **`constructor()`**: Initializes the service.
    - **`getStandardIntervals(): Interval[]`**: Returns the array of predefined standard intervals.
    - **`getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints(maxDataPoints: number, start: Date, end: Date): Interval`**: Calculates and returns the most suitable interval based on input parameters.
    - **`getStandardIntervalsImpl(): Interval[]`**: Private method to initialize and sort the standard intervals.
- **Important logic flows**: The core logic resides in `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints`, where the desired interval duration is calculated and the appropriate interval is selected from the predefined list.
- **Error handling**: Basic handling of null/undefined dates, but lacks robust error handling for other potential issues.
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: This is a single module containing two classes.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Data structures**: Arrays
- **Date objects**: Used for time range calculations.
- **Math functions**: Used for calculating time differences.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular**: The code is designed to be used within an Angular application. (Although, its logic could be used outside of Angular)

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None identified.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: For a very large number of data points, a more efficient search algorithm (e.g., binary search) could be used to find the appropriate interval.
- **Code Readability**: While already reasonably readable, consider adding more comments to explain complex calculations or edge cases.
- **Security Improvements**: No specific security vulnerabilities are apparent, but it's good practice to sanitize any external input before using it in calculations.
- **Scalability Considerations**: If the list of standard intervals needs to be dynamic, consider using a database or configuration file to store them.
- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling to handle invalid input parameters or unexpected conditions.  For example, validate `maxDataPoints` to ensure it's a positive number.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the service and ensure it handles various scenarios correctly.
- **Consider using a more robust time library**: While `Date` objects work, libraries like Moment.js or date-fns could provide more advanced functionality and better handling of time zones.
