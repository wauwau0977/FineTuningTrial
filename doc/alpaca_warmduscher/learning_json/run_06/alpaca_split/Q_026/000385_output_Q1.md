Relying solely on large arrays for chart data can lead to memory inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets. Here are several ways to improve memory efficiency and rendering performance:

1.  **Virtualization/Windowing:**  Instead of rendering all data points at once, only render the points that are currently visible in the chart's viewport. Libraries like ag-Grid or react-virtualized can help with this. This dramatically reduces the number of DOM elements and the amount of data that needs to be processed.

2.  **Data Aggregation/Downsampling:**  If the data is very dense, consider aggregating or downsampling it before rendering. This involves reducing the number of data points by averaging or summarizing them. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and rendered, but it can also reduce the accuracy of the chart.

3.  **Web Workers:** Move the data processing and manipulation tasks to a Web Worker. This offloads the work from the main thread, preventing it from blocking the UI. The Web Worker can process the data and send only the necessary data to the main thread for rendering.

4.  **Immutable Data Structures:** Use immutable data structures (e.g., libraries like Immer or Immutable.js) to optimize change detection.  Immutable data structures make it easier for Angular to detect changes and re-render only the necessary parts of the chart.

5.  **Canvas Rendering:** Instead of using SVG or DOM elements for rendering, consider using the Canvas API.  Canvas rendering is typically faster than SVG rendering, especially for large datasets. However, Canvas rendering can be less flexible than SVG rendering.

6.  **Data Bucketing:** Instead of storing individual data points, group them into buckets or intervals. This reduces the number of data points that need to be stored and rendered, but it can also reduce the accuracy of the chart.

7. **Sparse Data Representation:**  If the data is sparse (i.e., most values are zero or missing), use a sparse data representation to store only the non-zero or non-missing values. This can significantly reduce the amount of memory that needs to be used.

The most appropriate approach will depend on the specific characteristics of the data, the size of the dataset, and the requirements of the chart. A combination of these techniques may be necessary to achieve optimal performance. For example, you could use data aggregation to reduce the size of the dataset, then use virtualization to render only the visible data points.
