You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface defines a data contract for analytics statistics related to sole in/out delta during an operation. It represents a snapshot of statistical data captured over a specific time window, including average, minimum, and maximum values of the delta, compressor state, and the total number of probes considered. The interface is designed to facilitate the transfer of analytical data, potentially for reporting, visualization, or further processing.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java
- **Class Name(s):** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Defines the data structure for sole in/out delta statistics. It doesnâ€™t *do* anything itself; it *describes* the data.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:** This is an interface; it has no direct inputs or outputs. Implementations of this interface will have inputs/outputs depending on how the data is populated and used.  The interface defines the expected output format when data is retrieved.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The interface establishes a contract for accessing specific data points related to sole in/out delta analysis.
- **External Interactions:** No direct external interactions. Any interactions are handled by the implementation of this interface.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** As an interface, it doesn't handle edge cases directly. Implementations must handle cases like null values or invalid data.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Access to the data provided by implementations of this interface should be efficient.
- **Maintainability:** The interface is simple and well-defined, promoting easy maintenance and modification.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  The reliability and availability are dependent on the implementation of the interface. The interface itself is stable and doesn't introduce any points of failure.
- **Usability:** The interface is easy to understand and use for developers integrating with the analytical data.
- **Compliance:**  No specific compliance requirements are apparent from the interface definition alone.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:** The interface defines getter methods for each data point:
    - `getMeasurementDateStart()`: Returns the start date of the measurement window.
    - `getMeasurementDateEnd()`: Returns the end date of the measurement window.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg()`: Returns the average sole in/out delta.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMin()`: Returns the minimum sole in/out delta.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMax()`: Returns the maximum sole in/out delta.
    - `getCompressorState()`: Returns the compressor state (Boolean).
    - `getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow()`: Returns the total number of probes considered in the sample window.
- **Important logic flows:**  No logic flow exists within the interface itself.
- **Error handling:** No error handling exists within the interface itself. Implementations are responsible for handling null or invalid data.
- **Classes:** This is an interface, not a class.  There are no subclasses defined.
- **Modules:** Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.analytics` package, likely part of a larger analytics module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- `java.util.Date`: Used to represent date and time information.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonPropertyOrder`: Used for controlling the order of properties when serializing to JSON.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- No other internal dependencies are explicitly declared in the interface definition. Dependencies exist at the application level, but are not exposed by the interface itself.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Data Types:** Consider using more specific data types for dates (e.g., `LocalDateTime` from `java.time`) for better precision and clarity.
- **Immutability:** If the data represented by an implementation of this interface is not intended to be modified, consider making the interface methods constant-time operations by returning immutable data structures.
- **Validation:** Implementations should include validation logic to ensure the data conforms to predefined constraints (e.g., valid date ranges, non-negative values for delta).
- **Documentation:** Add Javadoc comments to each method explaining the purpose and expected values.
