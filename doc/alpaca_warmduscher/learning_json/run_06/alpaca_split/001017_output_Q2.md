Using `Double` (the wrapper class) instead of `double` (the primitive type) allows these fields to be `null`. This is the primary reason for choosing the wrapper class.

**Benefits of using `Double`:**

*   **Null Representation:** `Double` can represent the absence of a wind gust speed value (i.e., a missing measurement) by being set to `null`.  This is crucial if not all measurements are always available. Using `double` would require a "magic" value (like -1 or NaN) to represent a missing value, which can be less clear and more prone to errors.
*   **Collections:**  Wrapper classes are required when storing numerical values in collections like `List<Double>`, as collections cannot hold primitive types directly. (Though this isn't apparent in the code snippet).

**Drawbacks of using `Double`:**

*   **Memory Overhead:** `Double` objects consume more memory than primitive `double` values. Each `Double` instance is an object with associated overhead.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Accessing and performing operations on `Double` objects involves object creation and dereferencing, which can be slower than working with primitive `double` values directly.
*   **Potential for NullPointerExceptions:**  The use of `Double` introduces the possibility of `NullPointerExceptions` if the code doesn't handle `null` values correctly.  Developers need to be mindful of checking for `null` before performing operations on these fields.

Given the nature of weather data, where measurements might occasionally be unavailable, using `Double` is a reasonable choice, assuming the application handles potential `null` values appropriately. If missing values are rare and can be represented by a known default, using `double` with a sentinel value might be more efficient.
