For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionDevice.java' with name 'SessionDevice.java' we have the following question: 
Implement the `equals` method for the `SessionDevice` class. The method should compare two `SessionDevice` objects based on their `sessionId` attributes. Return `true` if the `sessionId`s are equal, and `false` otherwise. Handle the case where either `sessionId` might be null.
