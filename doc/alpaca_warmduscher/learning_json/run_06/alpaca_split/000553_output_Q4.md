The line `subscribe = interval(10000).subscribe( val => { this.myReload(); } );` sets up a repeating timer that periodically calls the `myReload()` method. Let's break it down:

1.  **`interval(10000)`**: This creates an Observable that emits sequential numeric values every 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds). Each emitted value is simply an incrementing number, but the value itself isn't used in this case. The important part is that it emits values at a fixed time interval.

2.  **`.subscribe( val => { this.myReload(); } )`**: This subscribes to the Observable created by `interval(10000)`. The `subscribe()` method takes a callback function as an argument. This callback function is executed every time the Observable emits a value (i.e., every 10 seconds).  Inside the callback:
    *   `this.myReload()` is called. This, as explained previously, fetches the latest heating data from the `HeatingDataService` and updates the component's state.

3.  **`subscribe = ...`**:  The result of the `subscribe()` method is assigned to the `subscribe` variable. The `subscribe()` method returns a `Subscription` object.  This object represents the active subscription to the Observable. It provides methods to unsubscribe from the Observable, stopping the repeating timer. Crucially, **keeping a reference to this `Subscription` object is essential to prevent memory leaks**. Without this reference, the subscription would be garbage collected, potentially stopping the timer prematurely or causing unexpected behavior. Because the component is likely destroyed at some point, the application code should unsubscribe from this interval when the component is destroyed. If not, the `myReload` function would continue to be called even after the component is no longer visible, causing an error.

In summary, this line of code creates a repeating timer that calls `myReload()` every 10 seconds, effectively polling the `HeatingDataService` for updates.  The assignment to the `subscribe` variable is a crucial practice to allow for proper cleanup of the subscription and prevent memory leaks.
