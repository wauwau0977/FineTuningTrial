Catching `Throwable` is generally discouraged because it's overly broad. It can mask unexpected exceptions that you didn't intend to handle, potentially hiding bugs or preventing graceful error recovery. For instance, an `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError` would be caught here, which are usually unrecoverable and should likely cause the application to crash rather than being silently re-thrown.  This can make debugging very difficult.

To improve this, I would:

1. **Identify specific exceptions:** Determine the specific exceptions that `meteoDataService.getData()` and `meteoSwissRepository.saveAll()` are likely to throw. Common candidates might include `IOException` (for network or file access issues), `DataAccessException` (from the repository), or potentially custom exceptions from the `meteoDataService`.
2. **Catch specific exceptions:** Catch only those specific exceptions. For example:
   ```java
   try {
       List<MeteoSwissEntity> meteoSwissEntity = meteoDataService.getData();
       meteoSwissRepository.saveAll(meteoSwissEntity);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       log.error("IO Exception while reading data from MeteoSwiss", e);
       throw new RuntimeException("Error reading data from MeteoSwiss", e);
   } catch (DataAccessException e) {
       log.error("Data access exception while persisting data", e);
       throw new RuntimeException("Error persisting data", e);
   } catch (Exception e) { //Catch-all for unexpected exceptions, still log
       log.error("Unexpected exception while polling data", e);
       throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected error during poll", e);
   }
   ```
3. **Handle or re-throw appropriately:** Decide whether to handle the exception (e.g., retry the operation, log an error and continue) or re-throw it. In this case, re-throwing wrapped in a `RuntimeException` is reasonable, as it indicates a critical error.

This approach provides more control, improves debugging, and makes the error handling more robust.
