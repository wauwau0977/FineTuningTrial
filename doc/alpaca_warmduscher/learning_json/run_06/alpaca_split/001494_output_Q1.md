This test class, `HeatingModbusReadServiceTest`, is designed to verify the correctness of the `getSignedNumber` method within the `HeatingModbusReadService` class. Based on the assertions, the `getSignedNumber` method likely takes an integer as input and converts it into a signed integer representation. It appears to be handling values within the range of a 16-bit integer (0 to 65535) and converting them to a signed integer, effectively implementing a two's complement conversion. The test cases demonstrate that values above 32767 are being interpreted as negative numbers. This suggests the service is likely reading data from a Modbus device where values are represented as unsigned 16-bit integers but need to be interpreted as signed values for temperature or other sensor readings.
