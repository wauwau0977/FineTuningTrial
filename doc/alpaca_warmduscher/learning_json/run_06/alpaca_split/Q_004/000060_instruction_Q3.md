For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass' with name 'styles.sass' where below a part of it is displayed...
```sass
mat-card
 border-color: white
 border-width: 1px
 margin: 12px 3px
```
Explain how these styles will visually affect a `mat-card` component (presumably from Angular Material), and what is the effect of each individual style property?
