Using a fixed average month length introduces inaccuracies because actual months vary in length (28, 29, 30, or 31 days). This could lead to slightly incorrect interval calculations when the application needs to determine intervals spanning months or longer durations.  The error would be relatively small, but could accumulate over extended periods.

Alternatives to improve accuracy include:

1.  **Using `Date` object methods:** Instead of calculating month length, leverage JavaScript's `Date` object to dynamically determine the length of each month within a specific date range.
2.  **Accepting a Date Range:** Instead of calculating intervals based on a duration, accept a start and end date and calculate the interval based on the actual number of days/months between those dates.
3.  **Configuration:** Allow the average month length to be configured, enabling adjustment based on the specific needs of the application or data being analyzed.
4. **Leap Year Handling:** The current implementation doesn't explicitly handle leap years. This could be addressed within the dynamic date calculation.
