I would add tests to verify the core caching functionalities: setting data, retrieving data, checking for cache hits/misses, and handling cache eviction (if implemented). Specifically, I'd target these scenarios:

1.  **Basic Set & Get:** Test setting a simple key-value pair (string/number/object) and retrieving it to ensure data is stored and retrieved correctly.
2.  **Cache Hit:**  Verify that retrieving data that *is* in the cache returns the expected value *and* potentially triggers a metric/event indicating a cache hit (if such logging exists in the service).
3.  **Cache Miss:** Test retrieving data that *isn't* in the cache, confirming that the service correctly identifies it as a miss and potentially triggers an appropriate action (e.g., fetching from a source).
4.  **Cache Eviction (if applicable):** If the `CacheService` has a size limit or a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism, I'd add tests to confirm that items are evicted as expected, and that accessing evicted items results in a cache miss.  This would involve setting more items than the cache can hold, or letting items expire.
5.  **Data Types:**  Test with different data types to ensure the service can handle them correctly (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays).  Consider cases with complex objects to verify deep equality or serialization/deserialization if applicable.
6.  **Error Handling:** If the service fetches data from an external source, I’d test scenarios where the fetch fails to verify appropriate error handling and that the cache doesn’t get corrupted.
7.  **Concurrent Access (if relevant):**  If the service is expected to handle concurrent access, I'd consider using a testing library to simulate multiple requests and verify that the cache remains consistent.

I would also consider using mocking techniques to isolate the `CacheService` from any external dependencies (like data sources) to make the tests more focused and reliable.
