For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/test.ts' with name 'test.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...
```typescript
declare const require: {
 context(path: string, deep?: boolean, filter?: RegExp): {
   <T>(id: string): T;
   keys(): string[];
 };
};
```
The code includes a `declare const require: { ... }`. What is the purpose of this declaration, and why is it necessary in the context of Angular testing? Explain how it addresses potential type-checking issues that might arise without it.
