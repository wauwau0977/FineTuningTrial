`super(message)` and `super(message, cause)` call the constructor of the parent class, `RuntimeException`. Passing the `message` ensures that a descriptive message is stored with the exception, making it easier to understand the error when the exception is caught or logged. The `cause` parameter is crucial for *exception chaining*. It allows you to wrap a lower-level exception within a higher-level exception. This preserves the original exception’s information, providing a complete trace of the error’s origin. For example, if a `ThException` is thrown due to a failed database connection (represented by a `SQLException`), the `SQLException` can be passed as the `cause`. This makes debugging much easier, as you can follow the chain of exceptions to identify the root cause of the problem. The cause is accessible via the `getCause()` method.
