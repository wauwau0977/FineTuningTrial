Defining `MeteoDataService` as an interface promotes loose coupling and allows for greater flexibility and testability.  By defining only the *contract* (the methods `init()` and `getData()`) without providing an implementation, you enable different implementations of the `MeteoDataService` to be used interchangeably.  

Specifically:

*   **Dependency Injection:** Other components can depend on the `MeteoDataService` interface without being tied to a specific implementation. This makes it easy to switch between different data sources (e.g., a real MeteoSwiss API vs. a mock for testing).
*   **Testability:**  Mock implementations of `MeteoDataService` can be easily created for unit testing, allowing you to isolate the components that depend on this service.
*   **Flexibility & Maintainability:** If the underlying data source or the way data is fetched changes, you only need to modify the implementation of the interface, without affecting other parts of the application that depend on the `MeteoDataService` interface.
*   **Adherence to SOLID Principles:** This design follows the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) from SOLID, which encourages designing interfaces tailored to clients and depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
