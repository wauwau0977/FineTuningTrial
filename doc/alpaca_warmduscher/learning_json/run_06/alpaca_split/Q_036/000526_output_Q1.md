Setting the width and height directly in the template using inline styles has both pros and cons compared to utilizing CSS classes:

**Pros (Inline Styles):**

*   **Simplicity & Quickness:** It’s the quickest way to apply styles and avoids the need to define and manage CSS classes.
*   **Specificity:** Inline styles have the highest specificity, ensuring that they override any conflicting styles defined elsewhere.

**Cons (Inline Styles):**

*   **Maintainability:**  Hardcoding styles directly in the template makes it difficult to maintain and update the styling consistently across the application. Any changes require modification in multiple places.
*   **Reusability:**  The styles are not reusable. If you need to apply the same styling to other elements, you’ll have to duplicate the inline styles.
*   **Separation of Concerns:**  It violates the principle of separation of concerns by mixing presentation (styling) with structure (HTML).
*   **Readability:**  Inline styles clutter the HTML and make it harder to read and understand.

**Why Choose CSS Classes:**

*   **Maintainability:** Changes to the styling can be made in one place (the CSS file) and will be reflected across all elements that use the class.
*   **Reusability:**  Classes can be applied to multiple elements, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** It keeps the presentation separate from the structure, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
*   **Readability:**  The HTML is cleaner and easier to understand when styles are defined in CSS classes.

**In this specific scenario**, while a fixed size might be intentional for a particular visual requirement, utilizing a CSS class would be the better approach for the following reasons:

1.  **Future Changes:** If the dimensions of the gauge need to be adjusted later (e.g., for responsiveness or different screen sizes), it’s much easier to modify the CSS class than to update the inline styles in multiple places.
2.  **Theming/Branding:** CSS classes allow for easier theming and branding, as you can simply modify the CSS to change the appearance of all elements that use the class.

Therefore, I would recommend refactoring the code to define a CSS class with the desired width and height, and then apply that class to the `<highcharts-chart>` element. For instance:

**CSS:**

```css
.fixed-gauge {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}
```

**HTML:**

```html
<highcharts-chart
  [Highcharts]="highcharts"
  [options]="gaugeChartOptions"
  class="fixed-gauge"
>
</highcharts-chart>
```
