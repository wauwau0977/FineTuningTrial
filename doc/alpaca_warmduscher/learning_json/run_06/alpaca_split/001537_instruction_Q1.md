For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/UUIDUtilsTest.java' with name 'UUIDUtilsTest.java'... 
The `testLength` method uses `UUIDUtils.EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` to assert the length of the generated short UUIDs. What are the benefits of using a named constant instead of hardcoding the expected length directly in the assertion?
