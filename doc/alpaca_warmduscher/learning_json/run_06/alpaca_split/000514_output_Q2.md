Benefits of passing all properties as constructor parameters:

*   **Clear Dependency Injection:** It clearly defines what dependencies are required to create an instance of `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity`. This enhances testability.
*   **Immutability:** It encourages the creation of immutable objects if the properties are not subsequently modified within the class.
*   **Readability:** It's immediately clear what data the entity represents.

Drawbacks:

*   **Verbosity:** The constructor signature becomes quite long with many parameters, making code less readable and harder to maintain.
*   **Order Dependency:**  The order of the parameters is important.  If you add or remove a parameter, it can break existing code that relies on the parameter order.
*   **Difficult to Scale:** Adding many more properties would make the constructor even more unwieldy.

Alternative Approach: Builder Pattern

A Builder pattern would be preferable, especially if the number of properties grows or if some properties are optional. A Builder class would encapsulate the object creation logic, allowing for optional parameters and more readable instantiation.

Example:

```typescript
class SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntityBuilder {
  private measurementDateStart: Date;
  private measurementDateEnd: Date;
  private soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg: number;
  private soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin: number;
  private soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax: number;
  private compressorState: boolean;
  private totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow: number;

  // Setters for all properties

  build(): SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity {
    return new SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntity(
      this.measurementDateStart,
      this.measurementDateEnd,
      this.soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg,
      this.soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin,
      this.soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax,
      this.compressorState,
      this.totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow
    );
  }
}
```

This allows for a more fluent and readable instantiation:  `new SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStatEntityBuilder().measurementDateStart(new Date()).soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg(10).build()`
