The logic handles values above 32767 as negative numbers because it's likely dealing with a 16-bit signed integer. A 16-bit signed integer (short in Java) can represent values from -32768 to 32767.  Values beyond this range "wrap around". 

Specifically, if a 16-bit unsigned integer has a value of 65535, when interpreted as a signed integer using two's complement representation, it becomes -1.  The test cases demonstrate this behavior; 65535 equals -1, 65534 equals -2, and so on. The conversion is necessary because Modbus often represents data as unsigned 16-bit integers, but the application might need to interpret these values as signed integers to represent temperatures or other physical quantities accurately. The provided test cases cover the boundaries and representative values to verify this two's complement interpretation is working as expected.
