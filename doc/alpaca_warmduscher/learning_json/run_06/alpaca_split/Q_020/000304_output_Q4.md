The `.video-holder` element is styled as a flex container. It's configured to:

*   `display: flex;`:  Establishes a flex container.
*   `flex-direction: column;`: Arranges flex items (children) vertically.
*   `align-items: center;`: Horizontally centers flex items within the container.

The `.video` element, presumed to be a child of `.video-holder`, receives the following styles:

*   `height: 50vh;`: Sets the video's height to 50% of the viewport height.
*   `object-fit: scale-down;`: Ensures the video scales down to fit within the specified height and width while maintaining its aspect ratio.  If the video's dimensions would exceed the container, it will be scaled down to the maximum size that fits.

Together, these styles create a vertically centered video container, and the video itself dynamically scales to fill up to 50vh of the screen, while always showing the complete video without cropping, by shrinking it if necessary. The centering of the video within the container is the primary goal.
