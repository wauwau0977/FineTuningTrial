For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/SessionRequest.java' with name 'SessionRequest.java' where below a part of it is displayed...
```java
private String id = UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID();
private Date requestDate = new Date();
private Long processingTime;
```
What is the purpose of initializing `id` with `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` and `requestDate` with `new Date()`? What are the implications of this initialization for the application?
