The `public` keyword in the constructor parameters creates and initializes class members with the same names and values as the provided arguments. It's a shorthand way of declaring and assigning values to properties of the `MeteoSwissEntity` class.  Without `public`, these parameters would be local variables within the constructor, and separate declarations of the properties would be needed to store the values. This approach makes the code more concise and readable by directly mapping constructor arguments to class properties. Effectively, it's equivalent to:

```typescript
 constructor(id: string, stationId: string, stationName: string, temperature: number, temperatureMin: number, temperatureMax: number, temperatureMeasureDate: Date, temperatureMeasureDateMin: Date, temperatureMeasureDateMax: Date, windGustSpeed: number, windGustSpeedMin: number, windGustSpeedMax: number, windMeasureDate: Date, windMeasureDateMin: Date, windMeasureDateMax: Date) {
    this.id = id;
    this.stationId = stationId;
    // ... and so on for all the properties
 }
```
