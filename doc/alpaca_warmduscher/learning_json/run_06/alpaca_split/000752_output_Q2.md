To add a second cache named "deviceMetadataCache", I would modify the `cacheManager()` bean to configure multiple caches. Hereâ€™s the modified code:

```java
   @Bean
   public CacheManager cacheManager() {
       ConcurrentMapCacheManager cacheManager = new ConcurrentMapCacheManager();
       cacheManager.setCacheNames(Arrays.asList("sessionDeviceCache", "deviceMetadataCache"));
       return cacheManager;
   }
```

I've used `setCacheNames` to define both cache names. `Arrays.asList()` creates a list of cache names which are then used to initialize the cache manager.

Considerations for deciding which data to store in each cache:

*   **Access Patterns:**  `sessionDeviceCache` is likely used for frequently accessed session-related device data.  `deviceMetadataCache` would be for less frequently changed, more static device metadata. The frequency of access is a key factor.
*   **Data Volatility:**  If device metadata changes rarely, it's a good candidate for caching. If it changes frequently, the overhead of maintaining cache consistency might outweigh the benefits. Session data is often short-lived and changes with each user session.
*   **Cache Size:**  Consider the expected size of the data for each cache. If one cache is expected to grow significantly larger than the other, it might need a different configuration (e.g., eviction policies, time-to-live (TTL)).
*   **Data Dependencies:**  If data in one cache depends on data in another, consider how to handle cache invalidation. For example, if a change to device metadata affects session data, you might need to invalidate the relevant session cache entries.
