The purpose of the conditional statement `if (groupEveryNthSecond > 0 && maxRows > 0)` is to enforce a mutually exclusive choice between limiting the results by a fixed time interval (`groupEveryNthSecond`) or by a fixed number of rows (`maxRows`).

The reasoning behind preventing both parameters from being supplied simultaneously is to avoid ambiguity and potential conflicts in how the data is retrieved and processed. Allowing both would create uncertainty as to which limiting criterion should take precedence.

If both parameters were allowed, the method would need to decide which one to apply, potentially leading to unexpected or inconsistent behavior. The design chooses to require the caller to explicitly state *how* they want to limit the results, preventing any ambiguity. The method is designed for either time-based grouping *or* row-based limiting, but not both simultaneously.
