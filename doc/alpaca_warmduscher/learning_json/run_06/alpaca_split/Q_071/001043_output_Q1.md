The mutability of `HeatPumpEntity` is a crucial design consideration. If the entity is mutable (its fields can be changed after creation), it introduces the risk of data corruption or inconsistent state if multiple parts of the system access and modify the same instance concurrently. If the entity is immutable, it guarantees that the data remains consistent and simplifies reasoning about the systemâ€™s behavior. I would strongly advocate for an immutable design. Implementation-wise, this can be achieved by making all fields `final` and initializing them in the constructor. Data transfer objects (DTOs) are typically immutable. If modifications are needed, a new `HeatPumpEntity` instance should be created with the updated values. This approach ensures data integrity and avoids the need for synchronization mechanisms. If performance is critical and creating new instances is costly, a defensive copy strategy might be employed when returning the entity, to prevent external modification of internal state.
