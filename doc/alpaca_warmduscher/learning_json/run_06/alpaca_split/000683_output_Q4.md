```java
/**
 * Actually execute only once... Yet, completely after full init to have the bean available
 */
@Scheduled(initialDelay = 50, fixedDelay = Long.MAX_VALUE)
public void logStartup() {
    Map<String, Object> detailInfo = new TreeMap<>();
    detailInfo.put("startupTimes", startupData);
    detailInfo.put("memoryInfo", MemoryInfo.getCurrent());
    detailInfo.put("serverInfo", infoBean);
    this.auditLogRepository.save(new AuditLogEntity("SERVER", "START", "STARTUP", Utils.toJSON(detailInfo), null, null));
}
```
The `logStartup` method is designed to execute a single time after the Spring Boot application has fully initialized. Its primary purpose is to log detailed server startup information to the database.

**Execution Trigger:** The `@Scheduled` annotation controls when this method runs.  `initialDelay = 50` means the method will be invoked for the first time after 50 milliseconds of application startup.  `fixedDelay = Long.MAX_VALUE` ensures that the method will *only* execute once.  Setting the fixed delay to the maximum long value prevents the scheduler from re-triggering the method after the initial execution.

**Data Collection:**  Inside the method, a `TreeMap` named `detailInfo` is created to store various startup metrics.  It collects the following data:

*   `startupData`: This appears to be an object (presumably of type `StartupData`) holding information related to application startup times.
*   `memoryInfo`: This retrieves the current memory usage information using `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`, likely including heap usage, etc.
*   `infoBean`: This is the `infoBean` object, presumably containing server-specific configuration or status details.

**Data Storage:**  The collected data within `detailInfo` is then converted to a JSON string using `Utils.toJSON()`. This JSON string, along with predefined constants ("SERVER", "START", "STARTUP"), is used to create a new `AuditLogEntity` object. This entity is finally persisted to the database using the `auditLogRepository.save()` method, effectively recording the serverâ€™s startup details in an audit log. The last two null values are likely fields for error information, which are not populated during the startup log.
