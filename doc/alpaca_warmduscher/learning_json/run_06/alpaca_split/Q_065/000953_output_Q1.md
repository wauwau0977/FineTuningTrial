The interface solely containing getter methods strongly suggests the application of the Immutability principle and the use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). It implies that instances of this interface (or implementations) are intended to be read-only after creation. The data is likely populated by another component (e.g., a service or data processing pipeline) and then passed around for reporting, analysis, or display.

**Benefits:**

*   **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe, simplifying concurrent access and eliminating the need for synchronization.
*   **Predictability:**  Once created, the data cannot change, making the code more predictable and easier to reason about.
*   **Caching:** Immutable objects are ideal for caching because their state never changes.
*   **Simplified Debugging:** Easier to debug because the state of an object is fixed at a given point in time.
*   **Decoupling:** Promotes decoupling between components. The component creating the data is independent of how it's used.

**Drawbacks:**

*   **Increased Memory Usage:**  If data needs to be modified, a new object must be created, potentially leading to increased memory consumption. (Though in a data analytics context, creating immutable records isn't usually a large performance concern).
*   **Potential for Verbosity:**  Creating new objects for every modification can sometimes lead to more verbose code.
*   **Not Suitable for all scenarios:** This design is not appropriate if the data requires frequent in-place modification.  However, in most analytical scenarios, read-only data is common.

In the context of a data analytics system, the benefits of immutability generally outweigh the drawbacks, as data consistency and reliability are paramount. The cost of creating new objects is typically less significant than the risks associated with mutable data.
