For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.spec.ts'... 
Consider that `OverviewCurrentComponent` had a property called `title` initialized to 'Default Title'.  How would you write a test to verify that the component's `title` property is correctly initialized upon component creation? (You don't need to write a full runnable test, just the relevant assertion portion).
