Consider the `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats` method. This method retrieves data using parameters that include `maxRows` and `groupEveryNthSecon`. How does the design of this method relate to the principles of the Open/Closed Principle (from SOLID)? Is it designed in a way that facilitates extensions or modifications without requiring changes to the existing code? Explain your reasoning.
