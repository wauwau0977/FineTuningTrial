Storing both the measurement value (like `sunshine` or `temperature`) and a corresponding measure date (`sunshineMeasureDate` or `temperatureMeasureDate`) is crucial for time-series data. It allows for historical analysis and tracking of changes in these values over time.

Here’s why it’s important:

1.  **Historical Context:** Without the date, you only have a snapshot of the value at one point in time. The date provides the context necessary to understand *when* that value was recorded.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Storing dates enables you to analyze trends, patterns, and seasonality in the data. You can track how sunshine or temperature changes over days, weeks, months, or years.
3.  **Data Aggregation:** You can aggregate data based on specific time intervals (e.g., daily average temperature, weekly sunshine total).
4.  **Data Validity and Accuracy:** Knowing the date allows you to identify potentially invalid or inaccurate data. For instance, if you receive a temperature reading for a future date, it’s clearly an error.
5.  **Time-Series Operations:** It supports various time-series operations like moving averages, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

In the context of MeteoSwiss data, it's essential to know when sunshine and temperature measurements were taken to understand weather patterns and provide accurate historical data. Without the dates, the data would be significantly less valuable.
