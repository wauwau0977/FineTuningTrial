For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByDayOfWeek.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
   Integer getDayOfWeekStartingMonday();
   String getDayOfWeekText();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease();
   Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease();
   Long getNumOfStatisticRecords1();
```

These are all getter methods defined within the interface. What does defining them as interface methods suggest about the implementation of classes that might implement this interface?
