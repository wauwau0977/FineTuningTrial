This `addInterceptors` method is part of the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface, which allows customizing Spring MVC’s behavior. It’s used to register interceptors that can intercept incoming web requests before they reach the controller. In this case, it registers an instance of `MyRequestInterceptor`, passing the `sessionRequestRepository` as a dependency to the interceptor’s constructor.

An interceptor acts as a filter or pre-processor for incoming requests. It can perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, request modification, or request handling before the actual controller logic is executed. By passing the `sessionRequestRepository` to the interceptor, the interceptor can access and potentially interact with the database repository for session requests, allowing it to perform actions based on or modify session data before the request is processed by the controller. For example, it could check if a session is valid, update session information, or log request details along with session information.
