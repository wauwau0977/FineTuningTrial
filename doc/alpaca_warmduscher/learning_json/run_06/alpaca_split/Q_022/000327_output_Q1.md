The component utilizes the `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook to initiate the retrieval of the server build timestamp. This hook is called by Angular *after* Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of the component.

In this context, `ngOnInit()` is crucial because itâ€™s the appropriate place to initiate asynchronous operations that depend on the component being fully initialized.  Calling `this.getBuildTimestampServer()` within `ngOnInit()` ensures that the component's properties, including the injected `heatingDataService`, are ready to use before attempting to fetch data. If this was done in the constructor, the `heatingDataService` might not be fully initialized, or other Angular mechanisms may not be ready to be used.  Using `ngOnInit()` is a best practice for component initialization and data loading, and keeps the constructor lightweight.
