To improve this test class, I would add several more test cases to enhance coverage and address edge cases. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Boundary Value Analysis:**
    *   **Zero Temperature:** Test with 0°C to check if the calculation handles freezing temperatures correctly.
    *   **Maximum Realistic Temperature:** Test with a high temperature (e.g., 40-50°C) to check for upper limits and potential overflow issues.
    *   **Zero Humidity:** Test with 0% humidity to see if the calculation handles completely dry air.
    *   **100% Humidity:** Test with 100% humidity to see if the calculation handles saturated air.

*   **Extreme Values:**
    *   **Negative Temperature:** Test with a slightly negative temperature (e.g., -5°C) to ensure robustness.
    *   **High Humidity and Temperature:** Combine high temperature and high humidity to test the upper limits of the calculation.

*   **Representative Values:**
    *   Add tests for more common temperature and humidity combinations found in typical indoor/outdoor environments (e.g., 15°C/60%, 25°C/50%).

*   **Error Handling (Important):**
    *   Add tests to verify that the method throws appropriate exceptions (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`) when invalid input is provided, such as negative humidity or extremely high temperatures.

*   **Test for Precision:**
    *   Instead of just range checks, use `assertEquals` with a delta to ensure the calculated humidity is within a reasonable tolerance of the expected value.

**Reasoning:**

Adding these test cases will cover a wider range of input conditions, making the test class more robust and reliable. Testing boundary and extreme values helps identify potential errors that might occur at the edges of the input space. Error handling tests ensure that the method behaves predictably and gracefully when faced with invalid input. And finally, utilizing more precise comparisons improves the accuracy and reliability of the tests.
