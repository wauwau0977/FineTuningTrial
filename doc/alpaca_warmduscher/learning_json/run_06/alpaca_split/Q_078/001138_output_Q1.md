Extending `RuntimeException` makes `ThException` an *unchecked exception*. This means that methods are *not* required to declare that they `throw` `ThException`. This choice is typically made when the exception represents a programming error, or a condition that the calling code is reasonably expected to handle without explicit `try-catch` blocks everywhere. It promotes cleaner code in situations where the exception indicates a bug in the applicationâ€™s logic, rather than an anticipated, recoverable error.  If it extended `Exception`, callers would *have* to either `catch` it or declare it in their `throws` clause, leading to potentially verbose code. This design signals that the expectation is either to fix the underlying cause of the exception, or that the exception indicates a condition that would likely be unrecoverable at the point of detection, making a `try-catch` not useful there.
