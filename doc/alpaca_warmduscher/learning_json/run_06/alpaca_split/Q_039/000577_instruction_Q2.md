For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.sass' with name 'overview-current.component.sass'... 
Consider the class `.textBig`. It only specifies `margin-bottom: 1px`. What is the likely purpose of this class, and what potential drawbacks might there be to using such a specific and limited styling rule?
