For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/spring/StartupData.java' with name 'StartupData.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
public class StartupData {
   private long startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   public long getStartupTimeTakenInMillis() {
       return startupTimeTakenInMillis;
   }
```
What is the purpose of the `getStartupTimeTakenInMillis()` method and what does it return? How is this related to encapsulation principles?
