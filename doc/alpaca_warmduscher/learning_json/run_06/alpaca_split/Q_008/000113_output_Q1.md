The `span` element inside the `button` is likely being used to contain the text or icon label of the button. The `display: block` property on the `span` is crucial for allowing the `span` to take up the full width of the `button`.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Default `span` behavior:** By default, a `span` is an inline element, meaning it only takes up as much width as its content requires and flows inline with other elements.
*   **Flex Layout and Full Width:** The `button` has `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`. This means the content inside will be arranged vertically. To make the text (contained within the `span`) take up the entire vertical space of the button, and ensure the button's contents are aligned as intended, you need to make the `span` a block-level element with `display: block`. This forces the span to occupy the full width available within the flex container and to expand to fill the buttonâ€™s height.
*   **Vertical Alignment:** By making the `span` a block-level element, the button's flex layout can correctly vertically align the `span` within the button.
