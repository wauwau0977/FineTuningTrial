The `@ResponseBody` annotation is crucial for building RESTful services. It instructs Spring to serialize the return value of the method (in this case, the `InfoBean` or `MemoryInfo` object) into a format suitable for transmission over HTTP. By default, it often uses JSON, but other formats (like XML) can be configured.

Without `@ResponseBody`, Spring would typically expect the method to return a `ModelAndView` object (view name and model data) and render a view. With `@ResponseBody`, the object is directly written to the HTTP response body, making these methods suitable for creating API endpoints that return data rather than render HTML pages. The HTTP content type is automatically set to a suitable format, like `application/json`.
