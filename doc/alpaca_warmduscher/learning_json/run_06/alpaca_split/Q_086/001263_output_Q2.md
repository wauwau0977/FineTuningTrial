The `SpringApplication` and `String[] args` parameters are passed to the constructor because of the `SpringApplicationRunListener` interface contract.  The interface *requires* implementations to have a constructor that accepts these parameters, even if the implementation doesn’t use them.

This design principle is related to *interface adherence* and *future extensibility*.  While `MyStartUpListener` doesn’t currently use the `SpringApplication` or `args`, the interface design ensures that any other `SpringApplicationRunListener` implementation can utilize these parameters if needed. It provides a consistent contract for all listeners.

This approach anticipates potential future requirements. For example, a different listener might need access to the `SpringApplication` to modify its behavior, or it might need to process the command-line arguments (`args`) passed to the application. By including these parameters in the constructor, the interface avoids breaking changes in the future if such functionality is added. It promotes flexibility and loose coupling.
