For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java'... 
The filter adds several CORS headers.  What is the purpose of the "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" header, and how does its value ("true" in this case) interact with the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header? Specifically, what restrictions exist when `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`?
