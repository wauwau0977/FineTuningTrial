Creating multiple instances of the `emptyInstance()` can lead to subtle but potentially significant bugs, especially if those instances are used as a placeholder or default value and are later compared or modified. The core issue is that while the *values* within each empty instance are the same initially, they are distinct objects in memory.

Here's a breakdown of potential problems:

1.  **Identity vs. Equality:** Using the `===` operator (strict equality) will return `false` when comparing two different `emptyInstance()` objects, even though their properties have the same values. This can cause unexpected behavior in scenarios where object identity matters. For example, if you're caching entities based on object identity, multiple empty instances will be treated as different entries.

2.  **Modification Issues:** If you modify a property of one `emptyInstance()` object, it will *not* affect other `emptyInstance()` objects. This can lead to inconsistent data if you expect all placeholder instances to be synchronized.

3.  **Memory Usage:** While the memory cost of a single instance is small, creating a large number of these empty instances can contribute to increased memory consumption, particularly in a long-running application.

4.  **Debugging Challenges:** Tracking down bugs related to incorrect object identity or inconsistent data can be difficult, as the root cause may not be immediately apparent.

In the context of `Warmduscher`, if the `emptyInstance()` is used as a temporary placeholder before actual data arrives, it's better to consider alternatives:

*   **Singleton Pattern:** Use a singleton to ensure that there's only one instance of the empty entity. This guarantees object identity.

*   **Null or Undefined:** Use `null` or `undefined` as a placeholder. This is often a simpler and more efficient approach.

*   **Immutable Empty Value:** Create a single, immutable empty instance and reuse it throughout the application. This avoids the issues of multiple instances and ensures consistency.

*   **Consider if a placeholder is even necessary.**  Sometimes, delaying data processing until the actual data arrives is a more robust solution.

Here's an example of using a single, immutable empty instance:

```typescript
export class BoilerStatsByHourEntity {
  // ... (constructor)

  static readonly EMPTY_INSTANCE = new BoilerStatsByHourEntity(0, 0, 0, 0);

  static emptyInstance(): BoilerStatsByHourEntity {
    return BoilerStatsByHourEntity.EMPTY_INSTANCE;
  }
}
```

This ensures that all calls to `emptyInstance()` return the same object, avoiding the issues described above.
