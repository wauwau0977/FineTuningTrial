Using `java.util.Date` has several drawbacks. It's mutable, which can lead to unexpected side effects and thread-safety issues.  It doesn't handle time zones very well, making it prone to errors when dealing with data from different locales.  It's also known to have limitations in accurately representing timestamps beyond a certain range. Finally, the API is poorly designed and often requires careful handling to avoid errors.

A better alternative is to use `java.time`, which was introduced in Java 8. Specifically:

*   **`java.time.LocalDateTime`:**  If you need to represent date and time without time zone information.
*   **`java.time.OffsetDateTime`:** If you need to represent date and time with a fixed offset from UTC.
*   **`java.time.ZonedDateTime`:**  If you need to represent date and time with a time zone and handle daylight saving time correctly.

For this case, `ZonedDateTime` is likely the most appropriate choice as it provides the most flexibility and accuracy.  These classes are immutable, thread-safe, have a much more intuitive API, and handle time zones and daylight saving time correctly.  Converting the input `Date` objects to `ZonedDateTime` (or `OffsetDateTime` if timezone isn't important) before using them in the query would be best practice.
