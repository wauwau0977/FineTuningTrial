Using a class with only a single style property like `.spacer` can lead to several drawbacks. It lacks specificity and reusability. If the same spacing is needed elsewhere with slightly different characteristics (e.g., different margin-top, padding, or even color), a new class would need to be created, leading to code duplication. It’s also less descriptive – a class named `.spacer` doesn’t immediately convey the *purpose* of the spacing, only *that* spacing is being applied.

It could be improved by making it more versatile and descriptive. For example, renaming it to `.vertical-space-medium` or `.section-separator` provides more context.  More importantly, it could be expanded to include a default set of spacing values (margin-top, margin-bottom, padding) relevant to the application's design system. Alternatively, a utility-first CSS approach using variables could allow dynamic spacing configuration. The current approach is brittle and will likely need modification as the UI evolves.
