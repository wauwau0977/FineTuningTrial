This styling is defining the layout and spacing for a date selection component.  It adds margin to the main container `.date-selector`, and then adds a small left margin to both `mat-form-field` and `mat-checkbox` elements within it. This likely positions a date input field and a checkbox side-by-side, with a little space between them and some space below the whole selector.

The framework or library being used is **Angular Material**. The `.mat-form-field` and `.mat-checkbox` classes are standard Angular Material component classes. This suggests the application is using Angular Material for its UI components.

Improvements and refactoring for better maintainability and readability:

1.  **Use of Angular Material Spacing:** Angular Material provides a spacing utility through a CSS class. Instead of fixed `margin-left: 5px`, it's best to use classes like `mat-spacing-small`, `mat-spacing-medium` or a custom spacing based on Angular Material's spacing scale. This will make the spacing consistent throughout the application.
2.  **Component-Specific Class:** Consider creating a more descriptive class for the date selector container itself, like `.date-selector-container`. This will provide a clearer scope and make it easier to target the styling without relying on deeply nested selectors.
3.  **Avoid Deep Nesting:** The current selector `.date-selector .mat-form-field` and `.date-selector .mat-checkbox` is not excessively deep, but nesting can become problematic as the UI grows. If possible, consider restructuring the template to reduce nesting.
4.  **Use of Variables:** If the spacing values are used in multiple places, consider defining CSS variables to improve maintainability and consistency.

Refactored example:

```sass
.date-selector-container
  margin-bottom: 10px
  display: flex  // for more control of elements position
  align-items: center //Vertical align of checkbox and form-field

  .mat-form-field
    margin-left: 8px
  .mat-checkbox
    margin-left: 8px
```

This refactored version leverages Angular Material's utility classes and reduces the complexity of the selectors while maintaining the same visual result. Using flexbox allows you to control the positioning better. This approach improves readability, maintainability, and consistency.
