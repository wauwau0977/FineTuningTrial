Using standard getters and setters makes the class mutable, which means its state can be changed after creation. This is simple to implement and understand, but introduces potential bugs related to unintended state modifications. It also makes it harder to reason about the object's behavior and can introduce threading issues if not carefully managed.

Immutable objects, on the other hand, have their state fixed at creation. This makes them inherently thread-safe, easier to reason about, and simplifies testing.

To refactor this class to be immutable:

1.  **Remove all setters:**  Remove the `setTotalMemoryKb()`, `setMaxMemoryKb()`, `setFreeMemoryKb()`, and `setAvailableProcessor()` methods.
2.  **Make fields private and final:**  Declare all fields (`totalMemoryKb`, `maxMemoryKb`, `freeMemoryKb`, `availableProcessor`) as `private final`.
3.  **Initialize fields in the constructor:** Ensure all fields are initialized in the constructor and cannot be changed thereafter.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data creation:** Since the object's state is fixed, you'll need to ensure all necessary data is available at the time of object creation. The `getCurrent()` method would need to gather all the information before creating the `MemoryInfo` object.
*   **Copying/Cloning:** If you need to create variations of the object with different values, you'll need to provide a mechanism for creating copies (e.g., a copy constructor or a static factory method that returns a new instance with the desired values).
*   **Complexity:**  While immutability has benefits, it can sometimes increase code complexity, especially if the object has many fields or if creating new instances is expensive. You'll need to balance these trade-offs.
