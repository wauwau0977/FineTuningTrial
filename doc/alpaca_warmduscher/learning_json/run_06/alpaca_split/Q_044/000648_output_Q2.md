Several exceptions could occur within this method:

*   **`MalformedURLException`**:  Thrown by `new URL(urlString)` if the `urlString` is not a valid URL.
*   **`IOException`**: Can be thrown by `website.openStream()` if the URL is unreachable, there's a network issue, or the server returns an error. Also, it can occur during `fos.close()` or `rbc.close()` if there are issues closing the streams.
*   **`SecurityException`**:  If security manager denies permission to connect to the URL.

Currently, the method declares `throws Exception`, which is a broad exception handling approach. A more graceful approach would involve catching specific exceptions and handling them accordingly:

```java
private static void downloadFileFromURL(String urlString, File destination) throws IOException {
    try {
        URL website = new URL(urlString);
        ReadableByteChannel rbc = Channels.newChannel(website.openStream());
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(destination);
        try {
            fos.getChannel().transferFrom(rbc, 0, Long.MAX_VALUE);
        } finally {
            try {
                fos.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Log the exception, but continue
            }
            try {
                rbc.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Log the exception, but continue
            }
        }
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid URL: " + urlString, e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e; //Re-throw to be handled by calling method
    }
}
```

This revised approach:

*   Catches `MalformedURLException` and throws a more specific `IllegalArgumentException` with a helpful message.
*   Uses `try-finally` blocks to ensure that streams are always closed, even if an exception occurs during the transfer.
*   Re-throws IOException to allow the calling method to handle it appropriately.
*   Handles the closure of the streams gracefully using try-catch blocks within the finally block.
