These fields store measurements related to the heat pump's operation.

*   **`boilerTemp` (double):** Likely represents the temperature of the boiler water. A `double` is used because temperature is a continuous value that requires precision beyond what an integer can provide. It can store fractional values like 65.3 degrees Celsius.

*   **`compressorHours` (int):** Represents the total number of hours the compressor has been running. An `int` is appropriate because compressor hours are a whole number; you wouldn't have a fraction of an hour for cumulative running time.

*   **`heatingIn` (double):**  Likely represents the temperature or flow rate of the heating fluid entering a component (e.g., the heat exchanger). A `double` is used for the same reason as `boilerTemp` â€“ to capture fractional values and precision.

*   **`heatingOut` (double):**  Likely represents the temperature or flow rate of the heating fluid exiting a component. Again, a `double` is chosen for precision and the possibility of fractional values.

Choosing the correct data type is important for accuracy and efficiency. Using a `double` for temperature and flow rates ensures that the measurements are recorded with sufficient detail, while using an `int` for cumulative hours makes logical sense.
