```java
public MeteoDataPoller(MeteoDataService meteoDataService, MeteoSwissRepository meteoSwissRepository) {
    this.meteoDataService = meteoDataService;
    this.meteoSwissRepository = meteoSwissRepository;
    meteoDataService.init(); // init
    log.info("Did init MeteoDataService " + meteoDataService.getClass().getSimpleName());
}
```

The constructor of the `MeteoDataPoller` class is responsible for dependency injection and initial setup.

**Dependencies:**

*   `MeteoDataService meteoDataService`:  An instance of the `MeteoDataService` is injected. This service is responsible for fetching the meteorological data from an external source.
*   `MeteoSwissRepository meteoSwissRepository`: An instance of the `MeteoSwissRepository` is injected. This repository is responsible for persisting the retrieved data to the database.

**Initialization Steps:**

*   `meteoDataService.init();`: The `init()` method of the injected `MeteoDataService` is called. This likely performs any necessary setup for the data service, such as initializing connections to external APIs, loading configuration data, or pre-caching resources.
*   `log.info(...)`: Logs an informational message indicating that the `MeteoDataService` has been initialized, including the simple name of the service class.

**Necessity:**

These initialization steps are necessary to ensure that the `MeteoDataPoller` has all the dependencies and resources it needs to function correctly. Injecting the dependencies allows for loose coupling and facilitates testing.  Calling `meteoDataService.init()` ensures the data service is properly configured before the polling process begins, preventing potential errors or failures during data retrieval.
