The `limit` parameter in the `getMedian` method serves to control the sample size used for calculating the median. This is useful in several scenarios:

*   **Performance Optimization:** When dealing with very large collections, calculating the median on the entire dataset can be computationally expensive. Limiting the sample size can significantly improve performance.
*   **Real-time Calculations:** In real-time data processing, you may only need a representative sample of recent data to calculate the median, rather than the entire historical dataset.
*   **Outlier Reduction:** If the dataset contains significant outliers, using a limited sample can reduce their impact on the calculated median, providing a more stable and representative value.
*   **Preventing Denial-of-Service:** In environments where an attacker could intentionally submit a very large dataset, limiting the sample size can prevent the median calculation from consuming excessive resources.

However, there are potential drawbacks:

*   **Reduced Accuracy:** Using a smaller sample size inherently reduces the accuracy of the calculated median. The smaller the sample, the more likely it is that the calculated median will deviate from the true median of the entire dataset.
*   **Bias Introduction:** If the sampling method is not random or representative, using a limited sample can introduce bias into the calculated median.  The current implementation takes the last 'limit' elements which could introduce bias if the data isnâ€™t randomly ordered.
*   **Information Loss:** Discarding data points through sampling results in information loss, potentially masking important patterns or trends in the dataset.
*   **Determining Appropriate Limit:** Choosing an appropriate value for the `limit` parameter can be challenging. A value that is too small may lead to inaccurate results, while a value that is too large may negate the benefits of sampling.
