The line `let desiredInterval = deltaInSeconcs / maxDataPoints;` calculates the ideal interval length in seconds based on the time range between `start` and `end` and the desired number of data points `maxDataPoints`.

Specifically:

*   `deltaInSeconcs` represents the total duration of the time range in seconds.
*   Dividing `deltaInSeconcs` by `maxDataPoints` determines the interval length that would result in approximately `maxDataPoints` data points being collected within the given time range.  It calculates how frequently data points need to be sampled to achieve the desired granularity given the total time duration.

This `desiredInterval` is then used in the subsequent loop to iterate through the predefined `intervals` and find the smallest interval from the `UtilsServiceService.getStandardIntervals()` that is *greater than or equal to* the calculated `desiredInterval`. The chosen interval is the one that best fits the requirements of the time range and the desired number of data points. Essentially, it selects the most appropriate predefined interval length to ensure sufficient data resolution without oversampling.
