For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts' with name 'heating-data.service.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed...

```typescript
let service: HeatingDataService;
 beforeEach(() => {
   TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
   service = TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService);
 });
```
What is the role of `TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService)` and how does it relate to the `service` variable?
