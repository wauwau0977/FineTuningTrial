The `beforeEach` block is a standard setup function in Angular testing using Jasmine. `TestBed.configureTestingModule({});` initializes a testing module. The empty object `{}` signifies that we're not providing any specific modules, declarations, or providers for this test suite. This creates a basic testing environment.  Without providing modules, declarations or providers, Angular's dependency injection won't work.

`TestBed.inject(UtilsServiceService);` then retrieves an instance of the `UtilsServiceService` from the testing module's dependency injection system. This creates a new instance of the service *before* each test (`it` block) is executed. This ensures that each test operates on a fresh instance of the service, preventing side effects and ensuring test isolation.  Without this line, the `service` variable would be undefined and the tests wouldn't function.
