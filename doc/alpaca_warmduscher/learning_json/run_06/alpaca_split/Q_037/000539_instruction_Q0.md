You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This component, `OverviewCurrentGaugeComponent`, displays a speedometer-style gauge visualizing current heating data. It retrieves this data from a `HeatingDataService` and updates the gauge every 10 seconds. The component uses the Highcharts library to render the gauge and emits the received data through an event emitter.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `OverviewCurrentGaugeComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Retrieve current heating data from `HeatingDataService`.
    - Display the data on a speedometer-style gauge.
    - Periodically refresh the displayed data.
    - Emit received heating data to other components.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: None directly.  Data is sourced from a service.
    - **Outputs**:  Emits `HeatingEntity` data via the `receivedNewTHValue` event emitter.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. On component initialization (`ngOnInit`):
        - Initializes Highcharts modules.
    2. A timer triggers a data refresh every 10 seconds.
    3. The `myReload()` method calls `HeatingDataService` to get the current heating data.
    4. The received data is converted into a `HeatingEntity` object.
    5. The `HeatingEntity` is emitted via the `receivedNewTHValue` event.
    6. The Highcharts gauge is updated with the retrieved data.
- **External Interactions**:
    - **`HeatingDataService`**:  Used to fetch current heating data.  This likely involves a network request to a backend server.
    - **Highcharts Library**:  Used for rendering the gauge visualization.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - **Service Failure**:  If `HeatingDataService` fails to retrieve data, the component should ideally display an error message or a default value. (Currently not implemented).
    - **Invalid Data**:  If the received data is invalid, the component should handle the error gracefully and not crash. (Currently not implemented).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:
    - Data refresh should occur every 10 seconds without significant UI lag.
    - Gauge rendering should be performant, even with frequent updates.
- **Scalability**:
    - The component should be able to handle a high frequency of data updates from the service without performance degradation.
- **Security**:
    - No direct security considerations within the component itself. Security relies on the `HeatingDataService` and the backend API.
- **Maintainability**:
    - Code is reasonably well-structured, but could benefit from more granular error handling and potentially separate methods for data processing and UI update.
- **Reliability & Availability**:
    - The component should be robust and handle potential service failures gracefully.
- **Usability**:
    - The gauge visualization should be clear and easy to understand.
- **Compliance**:
    - No specific compliance requirements are apparent.

## 5. Key Components

- **`OverviewCurrentGaugeComponent` Class**: The main component class that encapsulates the functionality.
- **`myReload()` Function**: Retrieves current heating data from `HeatingDataService`.
- **`gaugeChartOptions`**:  Defines the configuration options for the Highcharts gauge.
- **`receivedNewTHValue` EventEmitter**: Emits the received heating data.
- **Error Handling**: Limited.  No explicit error handling for service calls or invalid data.
- **Subscriptions**: Uses `interval` to periodically refresh the data.
- **Highcharts Integration**:  Utilizes Highcharts for visualization.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript**: The programming language used.
- **ES6+**:  Modern JavaScript features (e.g., arrow functions, classes, modules).
- **Observables & RxJS**: Used for asynchronous data streams and event handling.
- **EventEmitter**: Used for emitting data to other components.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular**:  The frontend framework used.
- **Highcharts**: A JavaScript charting library for creating interactive charts.
- **highcharts-more**: Extends Highcharts with additional chart types and features.
- **highcharts/modules/solid-gauge.js**:  Specific module for creating solid gauge charts.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`HeatingDataService`**:  A service responsible for fetching heating data.
- **`HeatingEntity`**: A data model representing the heating data.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**:
    - Implement a caching mechanism to reduce the number of calls to the `HeatingDataService`.
    - Optimize the gauge rendering to reduce CPU usage.
- **Code Readability**:
    - Extract the Highcharts options into a separate configuration file.
    - Separate data fetching and UI update logic into separate methods.
- **Security Improvements**:
    - Implement input validation to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Scalability Considerations**:
    - Consider using a more robust data streaming solution if the frequency of data updates increases significantly.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for the service call and handle invalid data appropriately. Display informative error messages to the user.
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify the component's functionality and ensure its reliability.
