The presence of `getMeasurementDate()`, `getMeasurementDateMin()`, and `getMeasurementDateMax()` suggests a need to represent a time range for the heat pump statistics. `getMeasurementDate()` likely returns the date and time of a single measurement. `getMeasurementDateMin()` and `getMeasurementDateMax()` likely represent the earliest and latest dates/times for a *set* of measurements. 

This setup is extremely useful for querying data within a specific timeframe. For example, a database query might use `getMeasurementDateMin()` and `getMeasurementDateMax()` to efficiently retrieve only statistics recorded within a defined period.  It implies a use case where data is aggregated or analyzed over time, rather than just retrieving individual snapshots. This is very typical for time series data such as heat pump statistics.
