The `generateShortTextUUID` method generates a unique short text representation of a UUID, ensuring it always has a fixed length of `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` (which is 22). The core purpose is to create a consistent-length identifier that can be reliably used in systems where a fixed-length string is required.

The logic behind the conditional block is to address a potential issue with the `toShortText` method. While `toShortText` aims to create a short text representation, the length of the resulting string isn't *guaranteed* to be exactly `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE`. This can happen due to the specifics of the Base58 encoding and the random nature of the UUID.

Here's how the conditional block works:

1. **Length Check:** It first calculates the length of the initially generated short text (`uuid`) using `StringUtils.length(uuid)`.

2. **Conditional Appending:** If the length of `uuid` is less than `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE`, it means the initially generated string is too short. To fix this, it generates *another* random UUID and converts it to a short text string (`uuid2`).

3. **Padding with Substring:**  It then extracts a substring from `uuid2` with a length equal to the difference between `EXPECTED_FIXED_SIZE` and the original length (`lengthOrig`). This substring is appended to the original `uuid`, effectively "padding" it to reach the desired fixed length.

By appending characters from another random UUID, the method guarantees that the final short text representation always has the expected length, ensuring consistency and compatibility in systems where a fixed-length identifier is required. The use of another UUID helps maintain randomness and avoids predictable patterns in the padding.
