For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.ts' with name 'app.component.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
import {interval} from "rxjs";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
```

What is the purpose of importing `interval` from `rxjs` and `environment` from `../environments/environment` in this Angular component, and how are these imports likely used within the component's logic?
