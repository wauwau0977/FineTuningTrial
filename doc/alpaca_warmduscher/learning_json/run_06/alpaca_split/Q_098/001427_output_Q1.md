This approach introduces potential issues with version string formatting and consistency. Appending ".0" directly in the code creates a tight coupling between the code and a specific versioning scheme.  If the application's versioning strategy changes (e.g., moving to semantic versioning with major.minor.patch), this code would need modification.  Also, relying on string concatenation can lead to errors if the property value is unexpectedly empty or contains invalid characters.

A better approach would be to define the complete version string in the application configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`). This promotes configuration-driven behavior and avoids hardcoding versioning details. Alternatively, use a more robust versioning library like `org.semver` to handle version parsing and formatting.  The property could be 'thserver.buildVersion' and the code would simply read that value without modification.
