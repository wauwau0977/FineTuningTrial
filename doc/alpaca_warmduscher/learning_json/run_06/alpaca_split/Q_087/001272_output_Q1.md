The `startupTimeTakenInMillis` field would ideally be populated during the applicationâ€™s startup process, specifically *after* the Spring context has been initialized but *before* the application begins handling requests.  I would use a Spring `ApplicationListener<ContextStartedEvent>`. This allows me to listen for the `ContextStartedEvent`, which is fired after the Spring application context is fully initialized. Within the `onApplicationEvent` method of the listener, I would record the current time, then record again after essential components are initialized (e.g., database connections, critical service initialization). The difference between these timestamps would be the startup time and assigned to `startupTimeTakenInMillis`.  Alternatively, a `@PostConstruct` method within a Spring-managed bean could also be used, though using an `ApplicationListener` offers more control over exactly *when* during the startup process the time is measured.  Dependency Injection would be used to access an instance of `StartupData` to set the value.
