The `.buildTimestamp` element is styled with the following properties:

*   `font-size: xx-small;`: Sets the font size to the smallest available size.
*   `color: rgba(203, 202, 202, 0.5);`: Sets the text color to a light gray with 50% opacity, making it very subtle.
*   `margin-left: 16px;`: Adds a 16-pixel margin to the left, creating some spacing between it and the preceding element.

These styles indicate that the `.buildTimestamp` element is intended to display build-related information (likely the date and time of the application build) in a very discreet way. The small font size, light color, and reduced opacity ensure it doesn't draw attention away from the main content of the 'about' component, serving primarily as a debugging or informational element for developers or advanced users.
