The primary design consideration is flexibility and convenience for the caller. Providing separate `execute` methods for `Function`, `Callable`, and `UnsafeRunnable` allows the caller to choose the interface that best suits their needs without requiring unnecessary adaptation or wrapping.

Benefits include:

1. **Reduced Boilerplate:** The caller doesn't have to create an adapter to convert a `Function` or `UnsafeRunnable` into a `Callable` if they donâ€™t need the features of a `Callable`.
2. **Clearer Intent:** The method signature clearly indicates the expected input type, making the code more readable and understandable.
3. **Improved Type Safety:** The compiler can enforce type safety more effectively when the input type is explicitly defined.
4. **Enhanced Usability:** Simplifies common use cases by eliminating the need for intermediate code.

By providing these variations, the `Unsafe` interface becomes more versatile and easier to integrate into different parts of the application. It prioritizes developer convenience without sacrificing type safety or code clarity.
