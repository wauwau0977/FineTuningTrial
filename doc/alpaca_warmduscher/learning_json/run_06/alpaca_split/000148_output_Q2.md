The current approach of logging the `environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds` value in the constructor is not ideal. While logging can be useful for debugging, it's generally better to avoid doing it directly in the constructor, especially for configuration values that are likely to be used throughout the component's lifecycle.

A better practice would be to inject the `environment` service or access it during the component's initialization, such as in `ngOnInit`. This provides more control over when and how the configuration value is used. More importantly, it separates concerns - the constructor should be used for dependency injection and minimal setup, not for application-specific logic.

Here's an improved approach:

```typescript
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {interval} from "rxjs";
import {environment} from "../environments/environment";
import {HeatingDataService} from "./heating-data.service";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.sass']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'thserver-client';

  constructor() {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    console.log("Setup the page refresh mechanism all " + environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds + " seconds.");
    // figure out a client id
  }

  myFullPageRefresh(): void {
    window.location.reload();
  }

  subscribe = interval(environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds * 1000).subscribe(
    val => {
      console.log("Execute full page refresh... ")
      this.myFullPageRefresh();
    }
  );
}
```

Benefits:

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The constructor remains focused on basic initialization.
*   **Readability:**  The logging statement is moved to a more logical place where the configuration value is first used.
*   **Testability:** This makes it easier to test the component's behavior with different configurations.
