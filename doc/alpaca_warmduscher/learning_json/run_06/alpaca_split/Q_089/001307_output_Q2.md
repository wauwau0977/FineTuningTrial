The `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` simplifies and standardizes the configuration of date and time formatters within Spring's `FormattingConversionService`. Instead of individually adding `Formatter` instances for `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` to the `conversionService`, the registrar provides a centralized point for defining the date and time formats.

Here's a breakdown of the purpose and benefits:

* **Standardization:** The `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` is designed to work specifically with `java.time` types (like `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`). It automatically creates the necessary `Formatter` instances based on the provided `DateTimeFormatter` objects (`dateFormat` and `dateTimeFormat`). This ensures consistency and avoids manual creation errors.
* **Automatic Registration:** It handles the registration of the `Formatter` instances with the `conversionService` internally. Without it, you'd need to manually create `Formatter` instances (as seen in the `localDateFormatter` and `localDateTimeFormatter` beans) and then explicitly register them with the `conversionService` using methods like `addFormatter`.
* **Convention over Configuration:** The registrar uses sensible defaults and conventions, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.
* **Avoiding Duplication:** Without the registrar, if multiple configurations need similar date/time formats, you'd need to repeat the `Formatter` creation logic in each one. The registrar centralizes this configuration.
* **Integration with Data Binding:** Spring's data binding mechanism relies on `Formatter` instances to convert strings to objects (and vice versa).  The `DateTimeFormatterRegistrar` ensures that these conversions are handled correctly for `java.time` types.

In essence, the registrar provides a cleaner, more maintainable, and more robust way to configure date and time formatting within a Spring application, making use of Spring's internal mechanisms for format registration. It promotes a declarative approach by defining formats, rather than an imperative approach of manually adding formatters.
