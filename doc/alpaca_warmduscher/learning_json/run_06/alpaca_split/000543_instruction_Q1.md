For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current-gauge.component.ts' with name 'overview-current-gauge.component.ts'... 
The `myReload` function retrieves data from `this.heatingDataService.getCurrent(false)` and updates the `heatingEntity`. Describe how this component handles data updates, and what is the role of `receivedNewTHValue` EventEmitter? How would you test the data flow from service to component to event emitter?
