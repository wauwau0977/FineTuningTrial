The `<footer>` element serves as the navigation bar at the bottom of the application. It's structured using Angular Material's `mat-toolbar` component, which provides a consistent and styled toolbar experience.

Inside the `mat-toolbar` is a `mat-toolbar-row` which holds the primary content – in this case, three buttons. Each `button` is configured for navigation using Angular's Router.

Each `button` utilizes the `routerLink` attribute to define the target route when clicked. `routerLink="/dashboard"` directs the user to the dashboard view, `routerLink="/insights"` navigates to the insights/charts view, and `routerLink="/about"` takes the user to the about page. The `routerLinkActive="active-link"` attribute applies a CSS class (presumably `active-link`, defined elsewhere in the application's styling) to the button when its corresponding route is currently active. This visually indicates to the user which section of the application they are currently viewing.

Each button also contains a `mat-icon` element, which displays an icon representing the button's function (dashboard, insights, or info). This improves the user interface by providing visual cues alongside the text. The `mat-icon` elements use Material Design Icons.

Finally, a `span` element with the class `toolbarText` contains the text label for each button ("Übersicht", "Diagramme", "Über die App").  The `toolbarText` class is likely used for styling the button text (e.g., font size, color) to ensure consistency and readability within the toolbar.
