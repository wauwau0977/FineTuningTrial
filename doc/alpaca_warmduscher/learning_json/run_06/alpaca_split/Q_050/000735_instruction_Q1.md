For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/impl/MeteoDataServiceImpl.java' with name 'MeteoDataServiceImpl.java'... 
The code retrieves data from multiple URLs (sunshine, temperature, wind gust) and then iterates through `stationIds` to build `MeteoSwissEntity` objects. What are the potential performance implications of this approach? Suggest at least two ways to improve performance, and explain why those improvements would be effective.
