This test case is a basic "smoke test" to confirm that the component has been successfully instantiated. It’s a common practice to start with such a simple test to ensure that the component setup is working correctly before adding more complex tests.

`expect(component).toBeTruthy();` verifies that the `component` variable (which holds the instance of `BoilerChartComponent`) is not `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string.  In other words, it's checking that a component instance has been created and is considered "truthy" – meaning it exists and is in a valid state. This doesn't test any specific functionality of the component, but confirms that the component can be created without errors.
