The `Hooks<T>` interface provides a mechanism for extending the functionality of `GlobalSynced` without modifying its core code. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, making the class more maintainable and extensible. Benefits include loose coupling â€“ `GlobalSynced` doesn't need to know *how* the before/after actions are implemented, only that they *are* implemented. This allows for different types of hooks to be plugged in based on the specific requirements of the application (e.g., logging, caching, metrics collection). It also promotes code reusability, as the same hooks could potentially be used with other synchronization mechanisms.

However, there are drawbacks. Introducing interfaces increases complexity. It also means that the calling code needs to provide an implementation of the interface, adding a responsibility for the client. It's a form of dependency inversion, which can increase the learning curve and the potential for misconfiguration.

A useful scenario would be a system where you need to track every access to the `syncedObject` for auditing or monitoring purposes. You could create a `LoggingHook` implementation of the `Hooks` interface that logs details about each operation before and after it's performed, without changing the core `GlobalSynced` class itself. If you later decide to switch to a different auditing mechanism, you can simply provide a different `Hooks` implementation.
