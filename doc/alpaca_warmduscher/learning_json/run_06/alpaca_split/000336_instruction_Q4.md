For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts' with name 'about.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `getBuildTimestampServer` method in detail. Include how it interacts with other components or services, what data it retrieves, and what it ultimately does with that data. What is the purpose of the `@ts-ignore` comment? Also, explain the return value of the method and its potential implications.
