The `System.out.println(ah);` statement prints the calculated absolute humidity (`ah`) to the console. It's **not essential** for the test to pass or fail. The test’s success or failure depends solely on the `assertTrue` assertion following it.

It's included primarily for **debugging and monitoring**. During test execution, it allows a developer to quickly see the calculated value of `ah` for each test case. This can be helpful in understanding why a test might be failing. If the assertion fails, the printed value can help pinpoint whether the calculation itself is incorrect or if the expected range is off. It provides a quick way to verify the results without needing to step through the code with a debugger.  It also provides a convenient way to observe the function’s output during development and regression testing.
