For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts' with name 'my-http-interceptor.service.ts'...  What design considerations led to injecting `ClientIdService` into this interceptor, rather than, for example, accessing the client ID directly within the intercept method? What are the benefits of this approach in terms of testability and maintainability?
