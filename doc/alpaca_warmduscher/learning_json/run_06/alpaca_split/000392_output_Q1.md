Currently, having numerous chart option objects defined directly within the component makes it harder to maintain and scale.  As the number of charts grows, this approach will quickly become unwieldy. Here are some ways to improve organization and management:

1.  **Create a Configuration Service:** Encapsulate all chart options into a dedicated service (e.g., `ChartOptionsService`). This service would have methods to return the appropriate options for each chart type. This promotes reusability and simplifies testing.
2.  **Use a Data Structure (e.g., Map):**  Instead of individual variables, use a `Map` to store chart options, with chart type as the key and the options object as the value. This provides a more structured and dynamic way to access the configurations.
3.  **Define Default Options:**  Create a base set of default options and then override specific properties for each chart. This minimizes duplication and promotes consistency.
4.  **Use a Configuration File (e.g., JSON):**  Consider loading chart configurations from a JSON file. This allows you to modify the configurations without changing the code.  This is particularly useful for environments where configuration needs to be dynamically adjusted.
5. **Separate Configuration from Logic:** Ensure that the logic for fetching and processing the data is separate from the chart configuration.
