For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts' with name 'heating-data.service.spec.ts'... 
The test suite includes a single `it` block: `it('should be created', () => { expect(service).toBeTruthy(); });`. What is the purpose of this test, and what potential issues could arise if this was the *only* test in the suite?
