Using `Double` instead of `float` for `getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()` and `getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()` provides greater precision. `Double` uses 64 bits to represent floating-point numbers, while `float` uses 32 bits. This means `Double` can represent a wider range of values with more decimal places.

For aggregate calculations like `sumBoilerDiffDecrease`, precision is often crucial.  Small rounding errors in repeated calculations with `float` can accumulate and lead to significant discrepancies in the final sum, especially when dealing with a large number of records.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Memory Usage:** `Double` requires twice as much memory as `float`. This is generally not a significant concern unless you are dealing with extremely large datasets or memory-constrained environments.
*   **Performance:**  Operations with `Double` might be slightly slower than with `float` on some architectures, although the difference is usually negligible.

In the context of boiler statistics, itâ€™s more likely that accurate representation of the sums is vital, making `Double` the preferred choice despite the minor performance and memory overhead.
