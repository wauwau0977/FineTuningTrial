This class, `Physics`, appears to contain utility methods related to physical calculations, specifically focusing on humidity. The `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method calculates absolute humidity (expressed in grams per cubic meter) based on temperature (in Celsius) and relative humidity (as a percentage or decimal).

The real-world problem it addresses is the conversion between relative humidity (what most humidity sensors directly measure) and absolute humidity. Absolute humidity is often a more useful metric in applications like HVAC, environmental monitoring, or scientific calculations.  Understanding absolute humidity allows for precise calculations of moisture content in the air.

The method takes two `double` inputs:
*   `temperature`: The air temperature in Celsius.
*   `relativeHumidity`: The relative humidity as a decimal (e.g., 0.6 for 60%).

It returns a `double` value representing the absolute humidity in grams per cubic meter.
