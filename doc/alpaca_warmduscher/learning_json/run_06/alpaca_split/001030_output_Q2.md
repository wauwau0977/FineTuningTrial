The key difference between `fixedDelayString` and `fixedRateString` lies in *when* the task is triggered relative to the *end* of the previous execution.

*   **`fixedDelayString`**: This specifies the time to wait *after* the previous execution completes before starting the next execution. In other words, it measures the interval between the *end* of one execution and the *start* of the next. The task will be triggered as soon as possible after the delay, regardless of how long the previous execution took.

*   **`fixedRateString`**: This specifies the interval between the *start* of successive executions. The task will be triggered at a fixed rate, regardless of how long the previous execution took. If the previous execution takes longer than the fixed rate, the next execution will start immediately after the previous one completes.

**When to prefer which:**

*   **`fixedDelayString`**: Use this when you want to ensure a minimum time between the *completion* of one execution and the *start* of the next. This is useful for tasks where the duration of execution can vary and you want to avoid overlapping executions or guarantee a minimum cooldown period. This is the more common and safer approach, particularly for tasks that interact with external systems or have dependencies.

*   **`fixedRateString`**: Use this when you need to run a task at a precise interval, regardless of how long it takes to complete. This is suitable for tasks that must run at a fixed frequency, such as generating a heartbeat signal or sending a periodic update. However, it can lead to overlapping executions if the task takes longer than the fixed rate.

In the given `HeatingDataPoller`, `fixedDelayString` is generally preferred.  We want to ensure that `heatingDataReadService.getData()` isn't called *too* frequently, even if a previous call was very fast.  We want a minimum time between data pulls to avoid overwhelming the external service.  If the data pull takes longer than the `fixedDelayString`, the next execution will simply be delayed until the previous one finishes.
