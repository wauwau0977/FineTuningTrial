For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/test.ts' with name 'test.ts' we have the following question: 
Explain in detail what the `test.ts` file does. Specifically, describe the purpose of each section of code, including the `require.context` call, and what the final line `context.keys().map(context)` achieves.  Assume the person is familiar with Angular testing, but needs to demonstrate a deep understanding of this specific bootstrapping process.
