For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.sass' with name 'about.component.sass'... 
The code includes the following:
```sass
.buildTimestamp
  font-size: xx-small
  color: rgba(203, 202, 202, 0.5)
  margin-left: 16px
```
What is the likely purpose of this styling, and what accessibility concerns might it raise?
