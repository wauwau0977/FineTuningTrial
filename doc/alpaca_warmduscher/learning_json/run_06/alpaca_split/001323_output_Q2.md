The `final` keyword in the method parameter `final InterceptorRegistry registry` indicates that the `registry` object cannot be reassigned within the `addInterceptors` method. It's a declaration that the reference to the `InterceptorRegistry` object will remain constant throughout the execution of this method.

This contributes to robustness and maintainability in several ways:

* **Immutability:**  It enforces a degree of immutability for the `registry` object within the method's scope. This reduces the risk of accidental modification of the registry, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
* **Thread Safety:** While not a complete guarantee of thread safety, using `final` makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the method in a multithreaded environment. It ensures that the reference to the registry will not change during the method's execution.
* **Code Clarity:** It signals to other developers that the `registry` object is intended to be treated as a constant within this method. This improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the method's intent.
* **Preventing Side Effects:** It helps prevent unintended side effects by ensuring that the method doesn't inadvertently modify the `InterceptorRegistry` object. This can simplify debugging and reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs.

While the impact might seem small in this specific case, using `final` whenever possible is a good practice that promotes safer and more maintainable code.
