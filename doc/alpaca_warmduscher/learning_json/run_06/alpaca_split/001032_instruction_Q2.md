For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/device/service/HeatingDataPoller.java' with name 'HeatingDataPoller.java'... 
The `pollData()` method logs the execution time. While useful for monitoring, how could this logging statement potentially impact the performance of the `pollData()` method itself, especially under high load? What would be a more robust approach to monitoring performance without introducing significant overhead?
