For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/boiler-chart/boiler-chart.component.ts' with name 'boiler-chart.component.ts'... 
The component initializes a large number of data arrays (e.g., `boilerTempAverage`, `soleInTempMinMax`, etc.). What are the potential drawbacks of initializing these arrays directly within the component class without considering the expected data volume, and how could these drawbacks be mitigated?
