The `static` keyword signifies that the `emptyInstance()` method belongs to the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class itself, rather than to any specific instance of the class. This means it can be called directly on the class (e.g., `BoilerStatsByHourEntity.emptyInstance()`) without needing to create an instance of `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` first. 

The intended use of this method is to provide a default, empty instance of the `BoilerStatsByHourEntity` class. This is useful when you need a placeholder object or a default value, potentially in cases where data is missing or unavailable. It ensures a valid object is always returned, initialized with zero values for each property.
