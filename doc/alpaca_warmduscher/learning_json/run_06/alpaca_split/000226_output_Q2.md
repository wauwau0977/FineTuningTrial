Having a large number of dedicated cache keys like `CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL`, `CACHE_KEY_CURRENT`, `CACHE_KEY_METEO_HISTORICAL`, etc. has both benefits and drawbacks.

**Benefits:**

* **Granularity & Control:** Each key allows for very specific caching.  This enables precise control over cache invalidation and eviction. If only the historical data changes, you can invalidate only that cache entry without affecting others.
* **Readability:** The code is more readable as each key clearly indicates the data it represents.
* **Reduced Cache Collisions:** Having separate keys minimizes the chance of different requests overwriting the same cache entry.

**Drawbacks:**

* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Managing a large number of cache keys can become cumbersome.  Adding, modifying, or removing data requires updating the cache key constants.
* **Increased Complexity:**  The code becomes more complex due to the need to manage and track all these different cache keys.
* **Potential for Inconsistency:**  If caching logic isn't consistent across all keys, it can lead to inconsistent data.
* **Memory Usage:** More keys can lead to a larger memory footprint for the cache, especially if the cache isn't properly managed.

**Improvements to Cache Key Strategy:**

1. **Categorization/Grouping:**  Instead of having a separate key for every slightly different request, consider grouping similar requests under a common key with parameters.  For example, instead of separate keys for different time ranges of historical data, a single `CACHE_KEY_HISTORICAL` could be used with a composite key that includes the `start` and `end` dates as part of the cache key.

2. **Dynamic Key Generation:** Instead of hardcoding all cache keys as constants, generate them dynamically based on the request parameters.  This can reduce the number of constants and make the code more flexible.  A helper function could create the key based on method name and input parameters.

3. **Cache Tagging/Invalidation:** Implement a cache tagging mechanism. This allows you to associate tags with cache entries. When data changes, you can invalidate all entries with a specific tag without knowing the exact cache keys.

4. **Abstraction:** Create an abstraction layer for the cache service. This allows you to easily switch between different caching implementations and manage the cache keys in a central location.

5. **Consider Cache Eviction Policies:** Properly configure the cache eviction policies to ensure that frequently accessed data is kept in the cache and that infrequently accessed data is evicted.

In this specific case, given the relatively large number of data retrieval methods, a combination of dynamic key generation with categorization might be the most effective strategy.  For instance, a base key like "heating_data" could be combined with the method name and relevant parameters to create a unique cache key.
