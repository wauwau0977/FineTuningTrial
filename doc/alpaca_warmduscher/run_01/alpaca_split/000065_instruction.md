You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This SASS file defines global styles for the Warmduscher web application's client-side interface. It primarily focuses on defining the height of elements with the class `.myLastSpace`, styling `mat-card` components, and modifying the background color of `mat-snack-bar-container` elements.  It’s a stylesheet intended to provide a basic visual appearance to the application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass
- **Class Name(s):** `.myLastSpace`, `.mat-card`, `.mat-snack-bar-container` (These are CSS classes, not programming class names)

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Define basic visual styles for specific HTML elements within the application.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  This file doesn't directly handle user inputs. Its output is the visual presentation of the web application in the browser.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The file defines styles that are applied by the browser when rendering the HTML. The browser parses the SASS, compiles it to CSS, and applies the styles.
- **External Interactions**:  None directly, though the styles depend on the presence of HTML elements with the specified classes and the availability of the Material Design (mat-) components.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  If the HTML elements with the specified classes are missing, the styles will not be applied.  Browser compatibility issues may arise if the SASS features used are not supported by the user's browser (though SASS is usually compiled to standard CSS).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  The styles should be applied quickly by the browser without significant rendering delays.  Keeping the file size relatively small will help with performance.
- **Scalability**: While this file itself isn’t a component that scales, the styling approach should be maintainable as the application grows.  Using a consistent styling convention is crucial.
- **Security**:  This file does not directly handle any security-sensitive information.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple to maintain due to its concise nature. However, as the application grows, it’s important to ensure that new styles don't conflict with existing ones.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The file should be available to the browser during page load. Any issues with the file's availability will result in unstyled elements.
- **Usability**:  The styles contribute to the overall usability of the application by providing a visual structure and improving readability.
- **Compliance**:  The styles should adhere to any accessibility guidelines or design standards specified for the application.

## 5. Key Components

- **`.myLastSpace`**: Defines the height of an element to 100px.
- **`.mat-card`**:  Sets the border color to white and the border width to 1px.  Also provides a margin of 12px on the top/bottom and 3px on the sides.
- **`.mat-snack-bar-container`**: Sets the background color of the snack bar container to a light gray (rgba(200,200,200)).
- **Error handling**: None explicitly present.  SASS compilation errors will occur if the syntax is invalid.
- **Classes**: CSS Classes are used to define styles.
- **Modules**: None.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **SASS Syntax**:  The file uses the SASS preprocessor syntax for styling.
- **CSS Properties**: Standard CSS properties are used for styling (e.g., `height`, `border-color`, `margin`, `background-color`).

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Angular Material**: The use of `.mat-card` and `.mat-snack-bar-container` suggests dependency on the Angular Material library for UI components. This is an implicit dependency.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None explicitly stated, though other SASS files or style imports may exist within the project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecements**: Minify the SASS file before deployment to reduce its file size and improve loading times.
- **Code Readability**:  Consider using SASS variables for colors, margins, and other frequently used values to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  If the application grows significantly, consider organizing the SASS files into multiple modules based on different components or sections of the application.
- **Naming Conventions**: Adopt a consistent naming convention for CSS classes to improve maintainability.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the chosen colors and styles provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.
