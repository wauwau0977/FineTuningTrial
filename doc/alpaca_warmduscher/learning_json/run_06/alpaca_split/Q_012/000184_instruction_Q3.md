For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.spec.ts' with name 'client-id.service.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
it("test create client id", () => {
   let serviceID1 = service.getClientId();
   let serviceID2 = service.getClientId();
   expect(serviceID1).toEqual(serviceID2);
 });
```
What is the intention of this test case, and what behavior of the `getClientId()` method does it aim to verify? Explain how the assertion `expect(serviceID1).toEqual(serviceID2);` contributes to confirming this behavior.
