If multiple threads concurrently call `getData()` on an implementation where the data is held in an in-memory list, several issues could arise:

1.  **Race Conditions:** Multiple threads reading and potentially modifying the list simultaneously could lead to inconsistent data.
2.  **Data Corruption:** Concurrent modification (e.g., adding or removing elements while other threads are reading) could corrupt the list.
3.  **Performance Degradation:** Even with read-only access, contention for access to the list could lead to performance bottlenecks.

Here are several ways to address these issues:

*   **Immutability:** The best solution, if feasible, would be to create an immutable list after `init()` is complete.  This prevents any modification after initialization and eliminates the need for synchronization.  Threads can safely read from the immutable list.
*   **Synchronization (using `synchronized` keyword):** Add a `synchronized` block around the code that accesses the list within the `getData()` method. This ensures that only one thread can access the list at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption. However, it could lead to performance bottlenecks if contention is high.
*   **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`:** Use a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` to store the data. This list provides thread-safe iteration and allows concurrent reads without blocking. Modifications create a new copy of the list, which can be expensive if modifications are frequent.
*   **`ReadWriteLock`:** Use a `ReadWriteLock`. This allows multiple threads to read concurrently but provides exclusive access for writing. This can be beneficial if reads are much more frequent than writes.

The best approach depends on the frequency of reads and writes and the performance requirements. For a mostly-read scenario with infrequent updates, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` or `ReadWriteLock` would be preferable. If updates are frequent, synchronization or immutability might be more appropriate.
