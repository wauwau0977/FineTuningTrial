Testing for `MeteoDataService` requires a multi-layered approach to ensure its reliability and correctness. Here's how I'd implement testing, categorized by type:

1. **Unit Tests:** These focus on testing individual components in isolation, primarily the logic within the implementation of `MeteoDataService`.
    *   **Mocking:** Mock external dependencies like the data source (database or API client) to isolate the service logic and avoid reliance on external systems.  Libraries like Mockito or EasyMock can be used.
    *   **Coverage:** Test all methods and edge cases within the `MeteoDataService` implementation, including:
        *   `init()`: Verify that the data source is initialized correctly and that any error handling mechanisms are working as expected.
        *   `getData()`: Test different scenarios with various inputs (page number, page size, filters, sort orders) and verify that the correct data is returned.  Test edge cases like empty datasets, invalid inputs, and large page sizes.
    *   **Assertions:** Use assertions to verify that the service returns the expected results, throws the correct exceptions, and handles errors gracefully.

2. **Integration Tests:** These verify the interaction between the `MeteoDataService` and its dependencies (e.g., the data source).
    *   **Real Data Source (Controlled Environment):** Use a test database or a controlled API environment to test the integration with the real data source.
    *   **Test Data:** Populate the test database with known data to ensure consistent and predictable test results.
    *   **Scope:** Test the entire flow of data, from fetching data from the data source to returning it to the client.  Verify that data is correctly mapped to `MeteoSwissEntity` and that any filtering or sorting is applied correctly.

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** These simulate real user scenarios and verify the entire system, including the `MeteoDataService`, the application's API, and any UI components.
    *   **Automated UI Tests:** Use tools like Selenium or Cypress to automate UI tests that interact with the application's API and verify that the data displayed to the user is correct.
    *   **Scope:** Test common user workflows, such as retrieving data, filtering it, and sorting it.  Verify that the entire system works as expected from the user's perspective.

4. **Performance Tests:** These measure the performance of the `MeteoDataService` under different load conditions.
    *   **Load Testing:** Simulate a large number of concurrent users accessing the `getData()` method to measure the service's response time and throughput.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Push the service beyond its normal operating limits to identify potential bottlenecks and failure points.

5. **Contract Tests:** (Especially if the data source is an external API) Verify that the API provided by the data source still adheres to the expected contract. Tools like Pact can be used.
