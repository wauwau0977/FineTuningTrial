To ensure the toolbar always remains visible, even with dynamically loaded content, I'd focus on a combination of techniques:

1. **`position: sticky;` instead of `position: fixed;`**: While `fixed` anchors the toolbar to the viewport, `sticky` allows it to scroll with the content until it reaches the top (or bottom in this case) of the viewport, then "sticks" in place. This is a cleaner approach than JavaScript-based solutions for most cases.  I'd change `.toolbarNav` to:

   ```sass
   .toolbarNav
     background-color: #424242
     bottom: 0
     z-index: 1000
     position: sticky
     display: flex
     justify-content: space-around
     padding-top: 10px
     border-top-style: solid
     border-top-color: #303030
     border-top-width: 1px
     margin-left: -7px // hack
   ```

2. **`z-index` Management**: The existing `z-index: 1000` is good, but it’s crucial to ensure no other element on the page has a higher `z-index` that might overlap the toolbar.  A review of the entire application's CSS is recommended.

3. **Consider `transform: translateZ(0);`**: Adding `transform: translateZ(0);` to `.toolbarNav` can sometimes force hardware acceleration, which might improve rendering performance and reduce potential layering issues, especially on mobile devices.

4. **JavaScript Fallback (If Necessary)**: If the dynamic content is *extremely* variable and the sticky positioning isn't sufficient, a JavaScript solution to dynamically adjust the toolbar's position or add padding to the content above it could be implemented. However, I would prioritize the CSS-only solution unless there are specific rendering issues.

The choice of `sticky` positioning is preferable because it avoids the complexity of JavaScript and leverages CSS’s built-in functionality for this common UI pattern.  It's also more accessible because it doesn't rely on JavaScript being enabled.
