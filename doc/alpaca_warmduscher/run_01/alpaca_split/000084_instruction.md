You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This component, `OverviewCurrentComponent`, is responsible for fetching and displaying current heating data and weather information. It periodically refreshes this data from a `HeatingDataService`. It also provides a recommendation based on the boiler temperature, aiming to give the user an indication of whether the water is warm enough for a shower. It also includes a listener for browser visibility changes to refresh data when the browser window becomes active again after being in the background.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.ts
- **Class Name(s):** `OverviewCurrentComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations:**
    - Fetch current heating data (boiler temperature, etc.).
    - Fetch current and historical weather data.
    - Provide a shower recommendation based on boiler temperature.
    - Periodically refresh heating and weather data.
    - Refresh data when the browser window becomes active.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**
    - **Inputs:** None (data is fetched automatically)
    - **Outputs:** Displays current heating and weather data and shower recommendation on the UI (via the component's template - not specified in the code).
- **Workflow/Logic:**
    1.  On initialization (`ngOnInit`), the component calls `myReload()` to fetch initial data.
    2.  `myReload()` calls `HeatingDataService` to:
        - Get current weather data for "KLO".
        - Get historical weather data for the last 24 hours for "KLO".
        - Get current heating data.
    3.  A `setInterval` is used to call `myReload()` every 30 seconds if the last refresh was longer than that.
    4.  A `HostListener` listens for browser visibility changes. If the browser window becomes visible, `myReload()` is called to refresh the data.
    5.  `getShowerRecommendation()` determines a recommendation string based on the current boiler temperature.
- **External Interactions:**
    - Calls `HeatingDataService` to fetch data from an external source (presumably a backend API).
- **Edge Cases Handling:**
    -  The recommendation logic provides various outputs based on boiler temperature.  It handles a wide range of temperatures, down to very cold, and provides corresponding messages.
    -  If the API calls fail, the component doesn’t explicitly handle the error.  The lack of error handling is a potential issue.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
    - The refresh interval is set to 30 seconds to balance data freshness with potential server load.
    - The performance of the `HeatingDataService` API calls impacts the overall responsiveness of the component.
- **Scalability:**
    - The component's design doesn't directly address scalability. Scalability depends on the `HeatingDataService` and backend infrastructure.
- **Security:**
    - The component doesn’t handle sensitive data directly but relies on the `HeatingDataService` for secure data fetching.
- **Maintainability:**
    -  The code is relatively well-structured but could benefit from more detailed comments and potentially refactoring the long `getShowerRecommendation()` method into smaller, more manageable functions.
- **Reliability & Availability:**
    - The component’s reliability depends on the availability of the `HeatingDataService` and the backend API.
- **Usability:**
    - The component provides a shower recommendation to improve user experience.
- **Compliance:**
    - No specific compliance requirements are apparent from the code.

## 5. Key Components
- **`myReload()`:** This function fetches the heating and weather data from the `HeatingDataService`.
- **`subscribe` (Interval Timer):** This interval timer calls `myReload()` periodically to refresh data.
- **`visibilitychange()`:** This function is a host listener that refreshes the data when the browser window becomes visible.
- **`getShowerRecommendation()`:** This function determines a shower recommendation string based on the boiler temperature.
- **`HeatingEntity` & `MeteoSwissEntity`:** Data transfer objects to hold the fetched data.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript
- Angular framework components (Component, OnInit, HostListener, Output, EventEmitter)
- Observables and Subscriptions (RxJS)
- Date and Time manipulation.
- String manipulation.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular:** Used for building the user interface and managing component lifecycle.
- **RxJS:** Used for asynchronous operations (Observables, Subscriptions).
- **Moment.js:** Used for date and time manipulation (although its use is diminishing in favor of native alternatives).

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`HeatingDataService`:** Provides access to heating and weather data from an external source.
- **`HeatingEntity`:** Data model for heating data.
- **`MeteoSwissEntity`:** Data model for weather data.

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for API calls in `myReload()` to handle potential failures and provide informative messages to the user.
- **Code Readability:** Refactor the long `getShowerRecommendation()` method into smaller, more manageable functions, potentially using a lookup table or a more structured approach.
- **Data Caching:** Implement data caching to reduce the frequency of API calls and improve performance.
- **Moment.js Replacement:** Consider replacing Moment.js with native JavaScript Date/Time APIs or a more modern library to reduce bundle size and improve performance.
- **Consider reactive approach:** Use angular reactive forms for a better data handling and control.
- **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the component, particularly the `getShowerRecommendation()` method and the data fetching logic.
- **Scalability Considerations:**  If the application anticipates a large number of users, consider implementing server-side caching and load balancing to improve scalability.
