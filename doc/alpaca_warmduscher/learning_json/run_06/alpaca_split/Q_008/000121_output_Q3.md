The `line-height: 24px` property sets the height of each line of text within the element with the `.toolbarText` class. This contributes to the vertical spacing of text, preventing lines from being too cramped or too far apart. A line-height slightly larger than the font size generally improves readability. The `margin-bottom: 8px` property adds 8 pixels of space below the text element. This creates a visual separation between the text and any elements that follow it, improving the clarity and organization of the toolbar's content. Together, these styles are used to fine-tune the vertical spacing of text within the toolbar for better visual appearance and legibility.
