For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts' with name 'boilerStatsDayOfWeekEntity.ts'... 
Considering the `ofWebService` static method: What potential issues could arise if the `data` object passed to this method does *not* contain all the expected properties (e.g., `dayOfWeekStartingMonday`, `dayOfWeekText`, etc.)? How would you mitigate these risks to ensure the application doesn't crash or produce incorrect data?
