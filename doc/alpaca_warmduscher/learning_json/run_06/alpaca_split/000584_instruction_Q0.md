You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code provides a unit test suite for the `OverviewCurrentComponent` Angular component. It verifies that the component can be successfully instantiated and that it initially renders without errors. It's a basic setup for further testing of the component's functionality and behavior.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `OverviewCurrentComponent`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The primary operation is to perform unit tests on the `OverviewCurrentComponent`.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This is a unit test, so there are no user inputs or direct outputs. The "input" is the `OverviewCurrentComponent` itself, and the "output" is a pass/fail result of the test.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The test suite follows a standard Angular testing pattern:
    1. Configure the testing module with the component's declaration.
    2. Compile the test module.
    3. Create a component fixture for the component.
    4. Get the component instance from the fixture.
    5. Detect changes to trigger component initialization.
    6. Assert that the component instance is truthy (i.e., successfully created).
- **External Interactions**: None. This is a self-contained unit test.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The current test only handles the basic case of component instantiation.  No error handling or specific edge case coverage is present.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Test execution should be fast, as it's a basic instantiation test.
- **Scalability**: Not applicable. This is a single unit test.
- **Security**: Not applicable.
- **Maintainability**: The test is simple and easy to understand, contributing to maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The test should consistently pass if the component is correctly implemented.
- **Usability**:  The test's purpose is clear to developers familiar with Angular testing practices.
- **Compliance**:  Adheres to standard Angular testing conventions.

## 5. Key Components

- **`describe('OverviewCurrentComponent', ...)`**: Defines the test suite for the `OverviewCurrentComponent`.
- **`beforeEach(async() => { ... })`**:  Sets up the testing module before each test case. Configures the `TestBed` with the `OverviewCurrentComponent` declaration and compiles the test module.
- **`beforeEach(() => { ... })`**: Creates the component fixture and component instance before each test case. Detects changes to initialize the component.
- **`it('should create', () => { ... })`**: The core test case that asserts the component is successfully created (truthy).
- **No subclasses or modules are explicitly defined in this snippet.**

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **TypeScript**: The code is written in TypeScript.
- **JavaScript**: Underlying language for the execution.
- **Object Literals**: Used for defining test configurations and assertions.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **`@angular/core/testing`**: Angular's testing utilities, including `TestBed`, `ComponentFixture`, and testing decorators.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

-  Potentially depends on the `OverviewCurrentComponent` itself (the file it's testing).

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Expand Test Coverage**: Add tests for the component's template, data bindings, event handling, and interactions with services or other components.
- **Mock Dependencies**: If the component depends on services, mock those services during testing to isolate the component's behavior.
- **Asynchronous Testing**: If the component performs asynchronous operations, use asynchronous testing techniques (e.g., `async`/`await` or `Promise`s) to verify the results.
- **Test Specific Scenarios**: Add tests that cover different input scenarios or edge cases to ensure the component behaves correctly in all situations.
- **Automate tests**: Integrate these tests into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing and early detection of bugs.
