The `ThException` class is a custom exception class designed to be used within the 'Warmduscher' project. It extends `RuntimeException`, making it an unchecked exception. This means that calling methods that might throw a `ThException` does not *require* the caller to explicitly catch or declare it in their `throws` clause.

The class provides two constructors:

1.  `ThException(String message)`: This constructor takes a `String` argument representing a descriptive error message. It then calls the `super(message)` constructor of the `RuntimeException` class, effectively passing the message to the base class for storage and potential display when the exception is caught (or printed as part of an uncaught exception stack trace).

2.  `ThException(String message, Throwable cause)`: This constructor takes a `String` message *and* a `Throwable` object representing the original cause of the exception. It calls the `super(message, cause)` constructor of `RuntimeException`.  This allows for exception chaining, preserving the original exception that led to the current `ThException`. This is crucial for debugging as it provides a complete history of the error.

Essentially, `ThException` is a simple wrapper around `RuntimeException` designed to allow developers to throw custom exceptions with associated messages and/or original causes within the 'Warmduscher' project.
