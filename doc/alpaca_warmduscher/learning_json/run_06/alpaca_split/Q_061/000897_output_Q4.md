The methods `getDi1Error()`, `getDi14PumpDirect()`, `getDi21PumpPrimary()`, and `getDi71Hkm1ixOpen()` are likely used to represent the status of various digital inputs (DI) or flags within the heat pump system. Based on their names:

*   `getDi1Error()`:  This likely returns a `Double` value representing the status of a general error flag. A non-zero value might indicate the presence of an error condition.
*   `getDi14PumpDirect()`: This likely represents the status of a "direct" pump, potentially a pump operating directly without modulation. The returned `Double` value could indicate if the pump is currently on or off (e.g., 1.0 for on, 0.0 for off).
*   `getDi21PumpPrimary()`: This likely represents the status of the primary pump in the heat pump system. The `Double` value returned probably indicates if the pump is running or not.
*   `getDi71Hkm1ixOpen()`:  This likely represents the status of a valve or damper (represented by "ix") in the heat pump system ("Hkm1" likely refers to a specific component).  "Open" suggests the returned `Double` value indicates whether this valve/damper is open or closed.

All four methods return `Double` values, suggesting that the status may not just be a simple on/off (boolean) but could represent a more nuanced state or value associated with the input. For example, it could represent a signal strength or a percentage.
