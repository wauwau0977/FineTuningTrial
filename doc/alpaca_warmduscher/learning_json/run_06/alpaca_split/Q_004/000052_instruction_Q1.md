For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/styles.sass' with name 'styles.sass'... 
The style `.mat-snack-bar-container { background-color: rgba(200,200,200) }` is targeting a class likely provided by a Material Design library. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of styling components from a UI library directly like this, instead of overriding styles through themes or configuration options?
