The `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` test method aims to verify the correctness of the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method. It does so by calling the method with different temperature and relative humidity values and then asserting that the returned absolute humidity values fall within expected ranges.

This is considered **unit testing**.  Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code (in this case, the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method) in isolation. It's not concerned with how the method interacts with other parts of the system.

The goal is to ensure that the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method is functioning correctly and reliably. Successful execution of these tests provides confidence that the method produces accurate results for the given inputs, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors in the application.  It promotes code quality by providing a safety net for future modifications and refactoring.
