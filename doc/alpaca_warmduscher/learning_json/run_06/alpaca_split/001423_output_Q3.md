The `@Controller` annotation marks the `InfoService` class as a Spring controller. This tells Spring that this class is responsible for handling incoming web requests. It's a crucial annotation for defining the entry point for handling requests within a web application.

The `@RequestMapping("/info")` annotation, when placed at the class level, defines a base path for all the request mappings within that class. In this case, it specifies that all the methods within `InfoService` will have their request mappings prefixed with `/info`. 

Combined, they define a scoped controller.  This means that all requests that begin with `/info` will be routed to this class. For example:

* `/info/general` would be handled by the `getInfo()` method.
* `/info/memory` would be handled by the `getMemoryInfo()` method.

This approach provides a clear and organized way to structure web application logic.  It promotes modularity, makes the code easier to maintain, and enhances the overall readability and understandability of the application. The combination allows for a clear mapping of URL paths to specific controller methods.
