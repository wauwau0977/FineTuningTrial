Using a simple JavaScript object (`this.cache`) as a cache store can lead to several issues in a large Angular application:

*   **Memory Leaks:**  Angular's change detection cycle and component lifecycles can prevent garbage collection of cached observables if components are destroyed before unsubscribing.  This leads to increasing memory usage over time.
*   **Cache Pollution:**  The cache can become filled with stale or unused data, reducing its effectiveness. Thereâ€™s no automatic eviction policy beyond the `evict` parameter which needs to be explicitly called.
*   **Lack of Scalability:** For very large datasets, a simple object might not be the most efficient data structure.
*   **Concurrency Issues:** In a multi-threaded environment (though less common in typical Angular apps), accessing and modifying the cache concurrently could lead to race conditions.

Alternative strategies include:

*   **`Map` object:** A `Map` provides better key handling and avoids potential key collisions that could occur with plain JavaScript objects.
*   **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache:** Implement a cache with a fixed size and an eviction policy that removes the least recently accessed items.  Libraries like `lru-cache` can be used.
*   **Dedicated Caching Library:**  Using a more sophisticated caching library designed for Angular, such as `@ngrx/data` or similar, provides features like data normalization, optimistic updates, and automatic cache invalidation.
*   **`BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject`:** Utilizing RxJS subjects can help manage the cache lifecycle and ensure proper unsubscription.
*    **Local Storage/Session Storage**: For persistent caching, consider using browser storage, though this is better suited for smaller datasets.
