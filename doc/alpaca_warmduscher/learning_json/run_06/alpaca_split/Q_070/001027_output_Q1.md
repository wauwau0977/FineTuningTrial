Throwing a `RuntimeException` immediately stops the execution of the `pollData` method and propagates the error upwards.

**Pros:**

*   **Simple:** It's a straightforward way to handle errors.
*   **Immediate failure:** It signals a critical problem that likely requires attention.

**Cons:**

*   **Brutal Stop:** It halts the polling process entirely.  A temporary glitch in the data source or network could stop the entire system from collecting data.
*   **Loss of Data:**  The polling interval is interrupted, leading to a gap in the data collection.
*   **Lack of Resilience:** It doesnâ€™t provide any mechanism for retrying the operation or gracefully handling transient errors.

**Alternative Error Handling Strategy:**

A more robust approach would involve a combination of logging, retry mechanisms, and potentially dead-lettering. Here's a proposal:

1.  **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Instead of catching `Throwable`, catch more specific exceptions (e.g., `IOException`, `NetworkException`). This allows for more targeted handling.

2.  **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry loop with exponential backoff.  For example, retry the `heatingDataReadService.getData()` call up to three times, with increasing delays between attempts (e.g., 1 second, 3 seconds, 9 seconds).  Use a library like Resilience4j for more advanced retry capabilities.

3.  **Logging:** Log the exception with sufficient detail (including stack traces) to aid in debugging.

4.  **Dead-Lettering (Optional):** If the retry attempts fail after a certain number of tries, consider using a dead-letter queue or similar mechanism to store the failed data or exception information for later analysis.

5.  **Metrics:** Track the number of retries and failures to monitor the health of the data retrieval process.

Here's a code snippet illustrating the concept:

```java
@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${thserver.pollingInterval:PT60s}", initialDelay = 0)
public void pollData() {
    long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    HeatPumpEntity heatPumpEntity;
    int retries = 3;
    for (int i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
        try {
            heatPumpEntity = heatingDataReadService.getData();
            break; // Exit loop if successful
        } catch (Exception e) {
            String msg = "Exception while reading data from ModBus or MockService. Attempt: " + (i + 1);
            log.error(msg, e);
            try {
                Thread.sleep((long) (Math.pow(2, i) * 1000)); // Exponential backoff
            } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                // Handle interrupt appropriately
            }
        }
    }
    heatPumpRepository.save(heatPumpEntity);
    log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0));
}
```

This revised strategy provides greater resilience and prevents a single failure from interrupting the entire data collection process.
