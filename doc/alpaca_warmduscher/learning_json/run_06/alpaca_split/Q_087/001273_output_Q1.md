The current design, relying solely on getter and setter methods, violates the principle of encapsulation and introduces potential maintainability issues. Any part of the application can directly modify `startupTimeTakenInMillis`, leading to unintended side effects or inconsistent state. In a larger application, it becomes difficult to track where and how this value is being changed. To mitigate this, I'd consider the following:

1.  **Make the field `private final`:**  If the startup time is only meant to be set once during application startup, making the field `private final` and setting it in the constructor prevents modification after initialization.
2.  **Introduce a method for setting the time:** Instead of a direct setter, create a method like `setStartupTime(long timeInMillis)` which could potentially perform validation or logging.
3.  **Consider immutability:**  If possible, make the class immutable. Set the `startupTimeTakenInMillis` in the constructor and don't provide any setter methods. This guarantees that the value will never change after the object is created.
