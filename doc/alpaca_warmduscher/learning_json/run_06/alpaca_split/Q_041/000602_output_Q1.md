The long chain of `if/else if` statements is indeed a code smell. Several refactoring techniques could improve it:

1.  **Using a `switch` statement:** If `boilerTemp` has a limited and well-defined set of possible values, a `switch` statement could be cleaner than the `if/else if` chain. However, this doesn’t seem practical given the continuous range of temperatures.

2.  **Using a Lookup Table/Map:** The most effective approach is to create a lookup table (a `Map` in TypeScript) that maps temperature ranges to recommendations. This centralizes the recommendation logic and makes it easy to add, modify, or remove recommendations.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    private showerRecommendations: Map<number, string> = new Map([
      [60, "Super heiss: Die Legionellen..."],
      [57, "Super heiss: Wahrscheinlich..."],
      [55, "Sehr heiss: Da könnte man..."],
      // ... other entries
      [32, "Wusste nicht, dass es so..."],
      [33, "Kurz vor dem Gefrierpunkt ;-)"],
    ]);

    getShowerRecommendation(): string {
      let boilerTemp = this.heatingEntity.boilerTemp;
      // Find the highest temperature in the map that's less than or equal to boilerTemp
      let recommendationKey = Array.from(this.showerRecommendations.keys())
        .filter(key => key <= boilerTemp)
        .reduce((maxKey, currentKey) => currentKey > maxKey ? currentKey : maxKey, 0);

      return this.showerRecommendations.get(recommendationKey) || "Stromausfall...";
    }
    ```

3.  **Using an Array of Objects:** Represent the recommendations as an array of objects with `temperature` and `recommendation` properties. Use the `find()` method to find the appropriate recommendation. This approach is similar to the lookup table but might be slightly less efficient.

The lookup table approach is preferred as it keeps the recommendation logic separate from the component's core logic and facilitates easy updates.
