Generating the ID within the interface as a `default` method has both advantages and disadvantages:

**Pros:**

*   **Convenience:**  Implementing classes don't need to implement their own ID generation logic, simplifying their implementation.  It provides a ready-to-use default behavior.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that all implementations of the interface use the same ID generation strategy. This can be important for system-wide consistency.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:** Avoids redundant ID generation code in multiple implementing classes.

**Cons:**

*   **Limited Flexibility:**  If you ever need a different ID generation strategy, you'll have to modify the interface, which could break existing implementations.
*   **Tight Coupling:** The interface is coupled to a specific UUID generation library (`UUIDUtils`). Changing this library would require modifying the interface.
*   **Potential for Conflicts:** If multiple instances are generating IDs concurrently using the default method, there’s a potential, though usually low, risk of ID collisions (depending on the `UUIDUtils` implementation). While UUIDs are statistically unlikely to collide, it's still a consideration.
*   **Violation of Interface Contract:** Some might argue that ID generation is an implementation detail and shouldn’t be part of the interface contract.

In general, if the ID generation is simple and unlikely to change, a default method is a reasonable approach. However, if there's a possibility of requiring different ID generation strategies, it's better to define an `getId()` method without a default implementation, forcing implementing classes to handle it themselves.
