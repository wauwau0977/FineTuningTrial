For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/client-id.service.ts' with name 'client-id.service.ts'...
Consider the following code snippet from the constructor:

```typescript
this.clientId = localStorage.getItem(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID);
if (!this.clientId) {
  // generate clientId...
}
localStorage.setItem(ClientIdService.KEY_CLIENT_ID, this.clientId);
```

What potential race condition could occur in a multi-threaded or asynchronous environment when this code is executed concurrently by multiple instances of the `ClientIdService`?
