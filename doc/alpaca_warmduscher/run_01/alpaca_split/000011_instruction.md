You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class, `MvcConfig`, is a Spring configuration class that sets up a custom request interceptor (`MyRequestInterceptor`) for the application.  The interceptor interacts with a `SessionRequestRepository` to potentially handle or log incoming requests. This is part of the 'Warmduscher' project, presumably a temperature/humidity sensor server. The configuration ensures the interceptor is registered with Spring's interceptor registry, allowing it to process requests before they reach the controller.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MvcConfig.java
- **Class Name(s):** `MvcConfig`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:  Configure and register a custom request interceptor with Spring MVC.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This class doesn’t directly handle user inputs or outputs. It's a configuration class that influences how requests are *processed* rather than handling data directly. The input is the `SessionRequestRepository` dependency injected during construction.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `MvcConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration` and `@Component`, indicating it's a Spring configuration class and a managed component.
    2. The constructor injects an instance of `SessionRequestRepository`.
    3. The `addInterceptors` method is overridden from `WebMvcConfigurer`. This method registers `MyRequestInterceptor` with the `InterceptorRegistry`, ensuring it intercepts all incoming web requests.
- **External Interactions**:
    - Interacts with the `SessionRequestRepository` to presumably access or modify session request data within the interceptor.
    - Interacts with Spring's `InterceptorRegistry` to register the interceptor.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  There is no explicit edge case handling within this class. However, any exceptions within the `MyRequestInterceptor` (which this configures) would need to be handled appropriately to prevent request failures.  If the `sessionRequestRepository` is null, the interceptor might fail, but this is not checked in the given code.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The impact on performance should be minimal as it's simply registering an interceptor. The interceptor's performance will be the primary concern.
- **Scalability**: The configuration itself doesn’t pose any scalability limitations.  The underlying `SessionRequestRepository` and `MyRequestInterceptor` must be scalable.
- **Security**:  The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `MyRequestInterceptor` and how it uses the `SessionRequestRepository`.  The configuration does not directly address security concerns.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, contributing to good maintainability.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The reliability depends on the underlying `SessionRequestRepository`.  The configuration itself does not introduce reliability concerns.
- **Usability**:  This class is internal and is not directly usable by end-users. It is used internally by the Spring application for configuration.
- **Compliance**: No specific compliance requirements are evident from the code.

## 5. Key Components

- **`MvcConfig` Class**: Spring configuration class responsible for registering the request interceptor.
- **`addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry)` Function**: Registers the `MyRequestInterceptor` with the Spring interceptor registry.
- **`SessionRequestRepository`**:  A dependency injected into the constructor, presumably for accessing session request data within the interceptor.
- **`MyRequestInterceptor`**: This class is not present in the provided code but is central to the function of this config, intercepting requests.
- **Error handling**: None present in the class itself; error handling will be within `MyRequestInterceptor`.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- Java core classes (e.g., `Object`).
- Annotations (`@Configuration`, `@Component`, `@Override`)

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Framework**: Used for dependency injection, configuration management, and web application development. Specifically, uses `WebMvcConfigurer` and `InterceptorRegistry`.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.SessionRequestRepository`**:  An interface or class for accessing session request data. This is a custom dependency within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Null Check**:  Add a null check for `sessionRequestRepository` in the constructor to prevent `NullPointerException`s within the interceptor.
- **Logging**: Add logging to the constructor and `addInterceptors` method for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Configuration Properties**: If the interceptor's behavior needs to be configurable, consider externalizing configuration options using Spring's `@Value` annotation or application properties files.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify that the interceptor is correctly registered and that the `SessionRequestRepository` is being properly injected.
- **Documentation**: Add Javadoc comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the class and its methods.
