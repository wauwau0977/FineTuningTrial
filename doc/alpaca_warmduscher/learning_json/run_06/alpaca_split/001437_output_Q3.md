Overriding the `toString()` method allows the `InfoBean` class to provide a custom string representation of its object.  By default, `toString()` simply returns the class name and hash code, which isn't very informative for debugging or logging. 

The returned string is formatted as a string literal "InfoBean{" followed by a comma-separated list of field names and their values, enclosed in curly braces. Each field is represented as `fieldName='fieldValue'`. For example, it might return a string like:  `"InfoBean{deviceName='MyDevice', buildTimestampServer='2023-10-27', buildVersionServer='1.2.3'}"`.

The benefits of overriding `toString()` are:

*   **Debugging:**  It makes it much easier to inspect the state of an `InfoBean` object when debugging, as you can simply print the object to the console and see its values.
*   **Logging:**  It provides a meaningful string representation of the object when logging, making it easier to understand the logged data.
*   **Readability:** It improves the readability of code that prints or displays `InfoBean` objects.
*   **Testing:**  Helps in asserting the object state in unit tests.
