The `ofWebService` static method in the `MeteoSwissEntity` class is responsible for creating a `MeteoSwissEntity` instance from data received from a web service.

It accepts a single argument, `data`, which represents the data received from the web service. The method first checks if the `data` is null. If it is, it returns an empty `MeteoSwissEntity` instance created using the `emptyInstance()` method. This handles cases where no data is received from the web service.

If `data` is not null, the method proceeds to create a new `MeteoSwissEntity` instance using the values from the `data` object.  It extracts various properties from the `data` object â€“ `id`, `stationId`, `stationName`, `temperature`, `temperatureMin`, `temperatureMax`, `temperatureMeasureDate`, `temperatureMeasureDateMin`, `temperatureMeasureDateMax`, `windGustSpeed`, `windGustSpeedMin`, `windGustSpeedMax`, `windMeasureDate`, `windMeasureDateMin`, and `windMeasureDateMax`.

Crucially, before assigning the date properties (`temperatureMeasureDate`, `temperatureMeasureDateMin`, `temperatureMeasureDateMax`, `windMeasureDate`, `windMeasureDateMin`, `windMeasureDateMax`), the method calls `HeatingDataService.convertDate` on each of them. This suggests that the dates received from the web service might be in a format that is not directly compatible with the `Date` object used in the `MeteoSwissEntity` class.  The `HeatingDataService.convertDate` function is therefore used to transform the date string received from the web service into a JavaScript `Date` object.

Finally, the method returns the newly created `MeteoSwissEntity` instance, populated with the data from the web service and properly formatted dates.
