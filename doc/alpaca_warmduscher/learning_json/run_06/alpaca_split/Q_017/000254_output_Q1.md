The assertion that `interval` is not null suggests that the `getIntervalInSecondsForMaxDataPoints` function could potentially return `null` or `undefined` under certain conditions. This could happen if the input parameters (data point count, start date, end date) are invalid, or if the function is unable to determine a suitable interval based on the input.

This assertion is important because it prevents the application from encountering a runtime error when it attempts to use the `interval` object. If `interval` were `null` or `undefined`, any subsequent attempt to access its properties (e.g., `interval.key`) would result in an error. The test ensures that the function always returns a valid object, even if itâ€™s not the ideal interval, preventing crashes and ensuring the application's stability. This demonstrates defensive programming, handling potential error conditions before they become problems.
