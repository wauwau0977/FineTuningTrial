Spring's `@RequestMapping` annotation is the core mechanism for mapping incoming HTTP requests to handler methods in a Spring MVC application. When these annotations are used at both the class and method levels, they work in a combined fashion to define the request mapping hierarchy.

Here's how it works in this case:

1. **Class-Level Mapping:** The `@RequestMapping("/email")` on the `EmailService` class defines a base path for all request mappings within that controller. This means any request that begins with `/email` will be handled by this class.

2. **Method-Level Mapping:** The `@RequestMapping("/send")` on the `send` method defines a relative path that is appended to the class-level mapping.

3. **Combined Mapping:** Spring combines the class-level and method-level mappings to create the complete request mapping URL. In this case, the complete mapping is `/email/send`.

4. **Request Dispatching:** When an incoming HTTP request with the URL `/email/send` is received, Spring's DispatcherServlet intercepts the request. It then examines the `@RequestMapping` annotations on all controller classes to find a matching mapping.

5. **Handler Resolution:**  Once it finds a controller class with a matching base path (`/email`), it examines the methods within that class to find a method with a matching relative path (`/send`).

6. **Method Invocation:** If a matching method is found (the `send` method in this case), Spring invokes that method, passing any request parameters (like `subject` and `content`) as arguments to the method.

Therefore, the combination of class-level and method-level `@RequestMapping` annotations allows Spring to precisely route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler method based on the URL pattern.
