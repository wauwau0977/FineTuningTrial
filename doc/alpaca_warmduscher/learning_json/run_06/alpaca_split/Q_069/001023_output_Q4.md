/**

```

The `windGustSpeedMin` field represents the minimum wind gust speed recorded for a given weather station and time period, as captured by this entity.  It's a `Double` to allow for fractional wind speeds.

In a larger system, this value could be used for:

*   **Historical Analysis:** Tracking minimum wind speeds over time to identify trends.
*   **Weather Alerts:**  If the minimum wind speed falls below a certain threshold, it could indicate unusual calm weather conditions, which might be relevant for certain applications (e.g., air quality monitoring).
*   **Data Visualization:**  Presenting a range of wind speeds (minimum to maximum) to provide a complete picture of wind activity.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing minimum wind speeds across different weather stations to identify areas with different wind patterns.
