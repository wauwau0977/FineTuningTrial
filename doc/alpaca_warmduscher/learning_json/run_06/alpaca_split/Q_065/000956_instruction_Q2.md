For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByHour.java'... 
The interface defines both `Double getSumBoilerDiffDecrease()` and `Double getSumBoilerDiffIncrease()`. How might you refactor this interface to potentially reduce redundancy and improve maintainability if you anticipate adding similar 'sum difference' metrics in the future?
