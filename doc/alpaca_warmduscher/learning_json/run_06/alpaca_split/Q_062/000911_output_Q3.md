The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are overridden to provide custom equality comparison logic for `SessionDevice` objects. This is crucial for correctly using `SessionDevice` objects in collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`, as well as other scenarios where object equality needs to be defined.

*   **`equals()`:** This method defines when two `SessionDevice` objects are considered equal. In this case, it checks if the `sessionId` of the two objects are equal. If the `sessionId` is null, it checks if both `sessionId`s are null. This ensures that two `SessionDevice` objects with the same `sessionId` are considered equal, regardless of the values of other fields.

*   **`hashCode()`:** This method generates an integer hash code for a `SessionDevice` object. The hash code is used by hash-based collections (like `HashSet` and `HashMap`) to quickly determine where to store the object in memory.  It *must* adhere to the following contract: if two objects are equal according to `equals()`, their `hashCode()` values must also be equal.  This implementation uses the `sessionId` to calculate the hash code. If `sessionId` is null, it returns 0.

**How they contribute to correct collection functioning:**

*   **`HashSet`:** When adding a `SessionDevice` to a `HashSet`, the `HashSet` uses the `hashCode()` method to determine the bucket where the object should be stored. When retrieving an object, the `HashSet` uses `hashCode()` to locate the bucket, then uses `equals()` to verify that the object in the bucket is actually the one being searched for. If `equals()` isn't overridden correctly, two objects that are logically equal might be considered different by the `HashSet`, resulting in duplicate entries or incorrect retrieval.

*   **`HashMap`:** `HashMap` uses the object as the key. It uses the `hashCode()` to find the bucket and `equals()` to find the key within the bucket. If the `hashCode()` and `equals()` are not implemented properly, `HashMap` won’t function correctly and won’t retrieve correct key-value pairs.

By correctly overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()`, you ensure that the collections treat `SessionDevice` objects with the same `sessionId` as the same object, preventing duplicates and ensuring correct data management.
