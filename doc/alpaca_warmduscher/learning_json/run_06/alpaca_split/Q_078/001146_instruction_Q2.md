For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/ThException.java' with name 'ThException.java'...
Imagine you are refactoring a section of 'Warmduscher' and need to throw a new `ThException`. You have a situation where a temperature reading is invalid (e.g., outside a reasonable range).  Write the code snippet showing how you would instantiate and throw a `ThException` in this scenario, including a descriptive message.
