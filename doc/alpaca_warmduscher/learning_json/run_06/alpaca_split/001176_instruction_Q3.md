For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Unsafe.java' with name 'Unsafe.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
static <R, P> R execute(Function<P, R> f, P param) {
    if (f == null) {
        return null;
    }
    try {
        return f.apply(param);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```

What is the purpose of this method, and how does it handle potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the provided `Function`?
