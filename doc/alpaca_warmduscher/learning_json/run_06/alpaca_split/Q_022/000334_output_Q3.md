The `constructor(private heatingDataService: HeatingDataService) {}` is used for dependency injection. Angular's dependency injection system provides an instance of `HeatingDataService` to the `AboutComponent`. The `private` keyword signifies that `heatingDataService` is a private member variable of the component, making it accessible only within the component's class.

`ngOnInit(): void` is a lifecycle hook in Angular. It's called *after* Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of the component.  Itâ€™s a good place to perform initialization tasks.

In this case, `ngOnInit` calls the `getBuildTimestampServer()` method. This method is responsible for fetching the server build timestamp.  The dependency injected `heatingDataService` is used within `getBuildTimestampServer()` to make an HTTP request to the server and retrieve this information.  Therefore, the constructor provides the service, and `ngOnInit` triggers the call to use it to begin the process of populating the `buildTimestampServer` property.
