For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.ts' with name 'about.component.ts'... 
Considering the `getBuildTimestampServer()` method: `this.heatingDataService.getServerInfo().subscribe(info => this.buildTimestampServer = info.buildTimestampServer); return this.buildTimestampServer;` What potential issues can arise from this implementation and how would you address them to ensure predictable and correct behavior? Explain with respect to asynchronous operations and potential race conditions.
