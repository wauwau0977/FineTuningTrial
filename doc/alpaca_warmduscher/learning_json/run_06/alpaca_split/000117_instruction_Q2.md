For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.sass' with name 'app.component.sass'... 
The code includes a seemingly commented-out section:

```sass
//button:hover,
//.active-link
// color: blueviolet
```

What was the likely intention behind this commented-out code? What considerations might have led to it being commented out, and what would be the potential implications of re-enabling it without further review?
