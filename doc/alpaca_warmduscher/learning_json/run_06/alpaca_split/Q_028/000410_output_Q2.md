If `this.windGustMeteoSwiss` is an empty array, the chart will display an empty line graph. Highcharts doesn't inherently throw an error or display a 'no data' message when a series `data` array is empty. It will simply render a line without any visible points.

To handle this scenario more gracefully, the component should check if `this.windGustMeteoSwiss` is empty *before* configuring the chart options. There are a few ways to do this:

1. **Conditional Series Configuration:** The most direct approach is to only include the wind gust series in the `chartOptionsWindGustMeteo` if the `this.windGustMeteoSwiss` array has data.

   ```typescript
   // inside the component logic before assigning chartOptions
   const windGustSeries = this.windGustMeteoSwiss.length > 0 ? [{
     name: 'Wind Spitze (Meteo Schweiz)',
     type: 'line',
     data: this.windGustMeteoSwiss,
     color: '#2596be',
   }] : [];

   this.chartOptionsWindGustMeteo = {
     // ... other options
     series: windGustSeries
   }
   ```

2. **No Data Message:**  You could use Highcharts' `noData` language option to display a user-friendly message when the series is empty. While this is good, a user may not know why no data is displayed.

   ```typescript
   //In chartOptionsWindGustMeteo
   lang: {
      noData: 'No wind data available'
   }
   ```

The first approach (conditional series) is the cleaner and preferred solution as it avoids unnecessary configuration and ensures that an empty series isnâ€™t rendered.
