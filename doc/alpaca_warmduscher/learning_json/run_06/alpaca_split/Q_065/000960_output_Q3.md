The commented-out method signatures (`getMaxBoilerTemp()`, `getMinBoilerTemp()`, `getAvgBoilerTemp()`) strongly suggest that the developers *considered* including maximum, minimum, and average boiler temperatures as part of the hourly statistics but ultimately decided *not* to include them in the current version of the interface.

This could be for several reasons:

*   **Complexity:** Calculating these values might have added significant complexity to the data aggregation process.
*   **Data Availability:** The required data for these calculations might not have been readily available or reliable.
*   **Use Case:** The developers may have determined that these values weren't essential for the primary use cases of the hourly statistics.
*   **Performance:** Calculating these values in real-time might have impacted performance.

However, the fact that they were included and then commented out suggests that they may be re-introduced in a future version of the interface.  The code serves as a form of documentation, indicating that these metrics were at least considered and may be relevant for future enhancements or different reporting requirements.  It's a good practice to leave such commented-out code rather than deleting it outright, as it preserves the design rationale.
