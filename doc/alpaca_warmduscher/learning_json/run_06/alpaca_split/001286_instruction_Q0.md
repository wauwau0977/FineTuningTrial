You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code implements a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter for a Spring Boot application. The filter adds the necessary HTTP headers to allow requests from any origin to access the server's resources. It's designed to handle requests from different domains that the server would otherwise block due to browser security restrictions.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java
- **Class Name(s):** `CorsFilter`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code's primary operation is to intercept incoming HTTP requests and add CORS headers to the HTTP response.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: 
    - **Input:** Incoming HTTP requests.
    - **Output:** HTTP responses with added CORS headers.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `doFilter` method is called for each incoming request.
    2. The method casts the `ServletResponse` to an `HttpServletResponse`.
    3. It adds four CORS-related HTTP headers to the response:
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Allows requests from any origin ("*").
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Allows credentials (cookies, authorization headers) to be included in the request.
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Specifies allowed headers in the request.
        - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS).
    4. The filter then passes the request and response to the next filter in the chain using `chain.doFilter()`.
- **External Interactions**:  Interacts with the Servlet API for request/response processing.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: 
    - The filter handles all incoming requests regardless of the origin.  The wildcard "*" for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` effectively bypasses origin checking. This could be a security concern (see Potential Improvements).
    - Errors during header addition are not explicitly handled, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The filter adds a minimal overhead to each request. Header addition is a relatively fast operation.
- **Scalability**: The filter is stateless and should scale well with increased load.
- **Security**:  The filter allows requests from any origin, which might be considered insecure in a production environment (see Potential Improvements).
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The filter itself is unlikely to cause system failures.  However, incorrect CORS configuration can lead to client-side issues.
- **Usability**:  The filter is easy to integrate into a Spring Boot application by simply adding the `@Component` annotation.
- **Compliance**:  The filter implements the CORS standard as defined by the W3C.

## 5. Key Components

- **`CorsFilter` class**: This is the main component. It implements the `Filter` interface and handles the addition of CORS headers.
- **`init()` method**: This method is called when the filter is initialized but does not perform any specific action.
- **`doFilter()` method**: This method intercepts the request and adds the CORS headers to the response.
- **`destroy()` method**: This method is called when the filter is destroyed but does not perform any specific action.
- **Important logic flows**: The core logic lies within the `doFilter` method, where the HTTP headers are added to the response object.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling is implemented.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Standard Java APIs (e.g., `javax.servlet.*`)
- Use of object-oriented programming principles.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Framework:** Specifically, the `javax.servlet` API which is part of the Spring context.
- **Servlet API:** Required for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None explicitly defined in the source code.  Likely relies on Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration to register the filter.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Security Enhancement:**  Instead of allowing requests from any origin ("*"), specify the allowed origins explicitly in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This significantly improves security. Consider allowing a configurable list of origins.
- **Configuration:**  Externalize the allowed origins, headers, and methods to a configuration file or environment variables. This allows for easier customization without modifying the code.
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling to catch potential exceptions during header addition.
- **Logging:** Add logging to track incoming requests and CORS header additions. This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.
- **Consider Preflight Requests:**  For complex requests (e.g., those with custom headers), the browser might send a preflight `OPTIONS` request. The filter should handle `OPTIONS` requests appropriately and return the allowed headers and methods.
