You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary
This specification details the `HeatingDataService` class within the 'Warmduscher' project. The service is currently a placeholder, primarily consisting of a unit test. Its intended purpose, based on the name, is to provide heating data, but the implementation details are absent in the provided code snippet. This spec focuses on what *is* present and outlines expected behavior and potential future functionality.

## 2. File Information
- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/heating-data.service.spec.ts`
- **Class Name(s):** `HeatingDataService`

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Primary Operations**: Currently, the service has no implemented functionality beyond instantiation. The intended purpose is to provide heating data, likely fetching, processing, and providing access to heating-related information.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  Currently no inputs or outputs. Expected future inputs may include requests for specific heating data (e.g., current temperature, historical data, target temperature). Outputs will be the requested heating data in a defined format (e.g., JSON, object).
- **Workflow/Logic**: Currently, the workflow is simply instantiation of the service through the testing framework. Future workflows will involve receiving data requests, fetching/calculating heating data, and returning the data.
- **External Interactions**: Currently, no external interactions. Future interactions will likely involve:
    - **API Calls:**  Fetching heating data from a backend server or data source.
    - **Data Storage:** Potentially caching data locally.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Currently no edge case handling.  Future edge cases to consider:
    - Network errors when fetching data.
    - Invalid data formats from the backend.
    - Lack of data availability.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Currently, performance is not a concern as the service is not functional. Future performance requirements: Low latency for data retrieval.
- **Scalability**:  Currently not a concern.  Future scalability requirements will depend on the number of users and frequency of data requests.
- **Security**: Currently not a concern. Future considerations: Secure communication with backend server. Data validation to prevent malicious input.
- **Maintainability**: The current code is minimal and easy to maintain.  Future maintenance will require adhering to coding standards and writing unit tests.
- **Reliability & Availability**: Currently, reliability is not applicable. Future requirements: Ensure data consistency and availability.
- **Usability**:  Currently not applicable.  Future considerations:  Simple and intuitive API for accessing data.
- **Compliance**:  No specific compliance requirements currently.

## 5. Key Components
- **Functions:**
    - The provided code only includes the test setup (`beforeEach`) and a single test (`it('should be created')`).
- **Important logic flows**: Currently there are no logic flows.
- **Error handling**: No error handling exists.
- **Classes**: The `HeatingDataService` class is the central component, but it currently lacks any implemented methods or properties.
- **Modules**:  The service is likely part of a larger Angular module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- TypeScript features: Classes, interfaces, testing frameworks

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Angular:**  Used for building the application.
- **@angular/core/testing:** Used for unit testing the service.
- **Jasmine/Karma:**  (Implicitly used by `@angular/core/testing`) Used as the testing framework.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- No internal project dependencies are visible in the provided code snippet.  Dependencies likely exist within the broader 'Warmduscher' project (e.g. data models, API clients).

## 7. Potential Improvements
- **Performance Enhancements**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve response times.
- **Code Readability**:  As functionality is added, ensure code is well-documented and follows coding standards.
- **Security Improvements**: Implement data validation and secure communication protocols.
- **Scalability Considerations**:  Consider using a scalable data storage solution and load balancing if the number of users grows.
- **Implement core functionality:** Add methods to fetch, process and provide heating data.
- **Add Unit Tests**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to cover all functionality.
