The `if (!StringUtils.equals("[0]", val))` condition within the loops in the `scanAllRegisters` method is used to filter out registers that have a value of 0. This is important for several reasons:

1.  **Reducing Noise:** Modbus registers often contain default or unused values that are set to 0. Including these values in the output would generate a large amount of irrelevant information, making it difficult to identify meaningful data.
2.  **Improving Readability:** Filtering out zero values makes the output more concise and easier to scan, focusing attention on registers that actually contain useful data.
3.  **Data Analysis:** In some cases, zero values might not be relevant for data analysis. Filtering them out can simplify the process and improve the accuracy of the results.
4.  **Performance:** While likely minimal in this case, reducing the number of logged/returned values can improve performance, especially when scanning a large number of registers.

In essence, the condition acts as a filter to remove noise and present a more meaningful and concise output of the Modbus register values.  It assumes that registers with a value of 0 are not of interest for the purpose of the scan.
