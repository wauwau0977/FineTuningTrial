`ComponentFixture` and `TestBed` are core Angular testing utilities. `TestBed` is used to configure the testing module. It allows you to define dependencies, providers, and declarations required for the component under test. In this case, `TestBed.configureTestingModule` creates a module specifically for testing `BoilerChartComponent`, declaring that component within it.  `compileComponents()` then compiles the test module.

`ComponentFixture` is used to create an instance of the component within the testing environment. `TestBed.createComponent(BoilerChartComponent)` creates this fixture, allowing access to the component instance (`fixture.componentInstance`) and the component's DOM element.  `fixture.detectChanges()` triggers change detection, ensuring the component's view is updated after any modifications.  Together, they set up the environment to isolate and test the `BoilerChartComponent`.
