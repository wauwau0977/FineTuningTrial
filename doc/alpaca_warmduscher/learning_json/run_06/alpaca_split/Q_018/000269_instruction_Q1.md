For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/utils-service.service.ts' with name 'utils-service.service.ts'... The `getStandardIntervals` method is a static method that returns the `standardIntervals` array. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a static property to store this list, as opposed to, for instance, declaring it as a class-level (non-static) property and instantiating the service?
