The `@Immutable` annotation from Hibernate signifies that instances of this entity will be treated as read-only after they are persisted to the database. This has several implications:

*   **Caching:** Hibernate can aggressively cache immutable entities, improving read performance significantly. Because the object's state never changes after persistence, there's no risk of stale data in the cache.
*   **Concurrency:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe, simplifying concurrent access and reducing the need for synchronization.
*   **Optimization:** Hibernate can optimize queries and data loading because it knows the entity's state will not change.
*   **Restrictions:**  Any attempt to modify the entityâ€™s fields after persistence will result in an exception.  This enforces data integrity.

In this context, using `@Immutable` is likely beneficial because the entity represents statistical data (temperature, wind speed) which is typically not updated.  It is a good practice to prevent accidental modifications to historical data, and the annotation enables performance optimizations related to caching and concurrency.
