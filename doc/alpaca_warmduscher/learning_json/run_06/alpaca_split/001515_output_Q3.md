The primary purpose of the `checkString` method is to test the encoding and decoding functionality of the `Base58BitcoinFlavor` class. It generates a byte array of a specified length, encodes it using `Base58BitcoinFlavor.encode()`, and then decodes the resulting string using `Base58BitcoinFlavor.decode()`.

The method verifies that the decoded byte array is identical to the original byte array, ensuring that the encoding and decoding process is lossless. It also asserts that the encoded string does not contain specific characters (',', '.', '>', '\'', '"') which could cause issues in certain contexts. This essentially confirms that the `Base58BitcoinFlavor` class correctly transforms a byte array into a Base58 string and back, preserving the original data.
