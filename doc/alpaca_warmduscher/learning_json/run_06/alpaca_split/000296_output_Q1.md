If I wanted to display the video and any accompanying controls or information *beside* the video instead of stacked vertically, I would change `flex-direction` to `row`.  Currently, `flex-direction: column` arranges the items within `.video-holder` vertically, one on top of the other, centered horizontally. Changing it to `row` would arrange the items horizontally, with the video and any other elements appearing side by side.  `align-items: center` would then control the vertical alignment of these side-by-side elements, centering them within the container. This is useful for a typical video player layout where the video occupies one part of the screen and controls are located alongside it.
