The `img` elements within the `.mat-card` component are styled with the following:

*   `max-height: 60vh;`: This limits the maximum height of the image to 60% of the viewport height. The image will not exceed this height, even if its intrinsic height is larger.
*   `object-fit: scale-down;`: This property dictates how the image should be resized to fit within its container (the `.mat-card`).  `scale-down` ensures that the image is scaled down *if* its aspect ratio would cause it to exceed either the width or height of the container. It maintains the imageâ€™s aspect ratio while ensuring it fits entirely within the container without overflowing.

The combined effect of these styles is to make the image responsive and fit nicely within the card, while always maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will scale down if needed to avoid overflowing the card's height, and it won't exceed 60vh in height. This ensures a visually pleasing and consistent presentation of images in the about component, regardless of the image's original dimensions.
