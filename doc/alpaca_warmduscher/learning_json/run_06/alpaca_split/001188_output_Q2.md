The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation signals to the compiler that the interface is intended to be used as a functional interface. While the interface *already* functionally qualifies as such (it has only one abstract method), the annotation provides several benefits:

1.  **Compiler Enforcement:** It instructs the compiler to verify that the interface *remains* a functional interface. If someone accidentally adds a second abstract method in the future, the compiler will issue an error, preventing unintended breakage. This provides a level of compile-time safety.

2.  **Code Readability and Intent:** It clearly communicates to other developers (and to yourself in the future) that this interface is designed to be used with lambda expressions or method references. This enhances code readability and maintainability.

3.  **Enables Certain Compiler Optimizations:** In some cases, the compiler can use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to perform specific optimizations related to lambda expressions.

In essence, it's a form of defensive programming and a signal of intent. It doesn't *change* the behavior of the code, but it makes it more robust and easier to understand.
