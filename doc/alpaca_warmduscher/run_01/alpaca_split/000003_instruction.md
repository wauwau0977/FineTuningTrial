You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This specification details the `PhysicsTest` class, which is a unit test for the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method within the `Warmduscher` project. The test verifies that the humidity approximation method returns values within expected ranges for different temperature and relative humidity inputs. The purpose is to ensure the accuracy of this humidity calculation for the core functionality of the `Warmduscher` application.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** `Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java`
- **Class Name(s):** `PhysicsTest`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: The code's primary operation is to execute unit tests against the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method. It aims to confirm that the calculated absolute humidity falls within predefined acceptable boundaries for various temperature and relative humidity conditions.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  The code has no direct user input. It uses hardcoded temperature and relative humidity values as input to the tested method and asserts the output (calculated absolute humidity) against expected ranges. The output to the console is debug print statements of the calculated humidity values.
- **Workflow/Logic**: The test class contains a single test method, `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation`. This method calls `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` with three different sets of temperature and relative humidity values.  For each call, it prints the calculated absolute humidity to the console and then asserts that the returned value falls within a specified range using `assertTrue`.
- **External Interactions**: The test relies on the `Physics` class and its `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method. No other external interactions (database, files, network) are present in this test.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The provided test cases cover a limited set of input values. Edge cases such as extremely high or low temperatures, or very high or low relative humidity, are not explicitly handled in this test suite. The test does not validate any exception handling within the `Physics` class.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The test execution should be relatively fast, as it involves simple calculations and assertions. Performance is not a critical requirement for this specific test.
- **Scalability**:  Scalability is not relevant to this test class.
- **Security**: Security is not a concern for this unit test.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, promoting maintainability. However, adding more test cases would increase complexity.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The test should consistently pass if the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method is functioning correctly.
- **Usability**: The test class is easy to use and integrate with other tests within the project.
- **Compliance**: The test is written using JUnit 5 and follows standard unit testing practices.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()`: This test method executes the test cases by calling the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` method with different inputs and asserting the result.
- **Important logic flows**: The logic flow is simple: call the method under test with specific inputs, print the result for debugging, and assert that the result falls within the expected range.
- **Error handling**: No explicit error handling is present in the test class beyond the standard JUnit assertions. Any exceptions thrown by the `Physics.calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation()` method will cause the test to fail.
- **Classes**: There are no subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: The test is part of the `thserver` module within the `Warmduscher` project.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data Structures: Primarily utilizes primitive data types (double).
- Basic arithmetic operations.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **JUnit Jupiter**: Used for defining and executing unit tests.
- **org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions**: For performing assertions.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Physics`**: This class contains the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method being tested.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments**: Not applicable to this unit test.
- **Code Readability**: The code is already fairly readable.
- **Security Improvements**: Not applicable to this unit test.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Not applicable to this unit test.
- **Expanded Test Coverage**: Add more test cases to cover a wider range of temperature and relative humidity values, including edge cases (very low/high values). Consider testing with boundary values.
- **Parameterization**: Use JUnit's parameterization features to reduce code duplication and make it easier to add new test cases.
- **Descriptive Assertions**: Use more descriptive assertion messages to improve debugging. For instance, instead of just `assertTrue(ah > 13.7 && ah < 13.9)`, use `assertTrue(ah > 13.7 && ah < 13.9, "Absolute humidity is outside the expected range for temperature 20 and relative humidity 80.");`
