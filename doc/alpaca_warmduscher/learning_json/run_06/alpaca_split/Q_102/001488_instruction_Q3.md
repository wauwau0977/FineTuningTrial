For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplicationTests.java' with name 'ThserverApplicationTests.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class ThserverApplicationTests {
```
What does the `@SpringBootTest` annotation above tell Spring Boot about how to configure the test environment for the `ThserverApplicationTests` class? What implications does this have for the resources used during the test?
