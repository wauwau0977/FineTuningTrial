For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/about/about.component.sass' with name 'about.component.sass' where below a part of it is displayed...
```sass
::ng-deep .mat-card-header-text
  .myInfoTitle
    margin-left: -15px
```
What is the purpose of the `::ng-deep` selector and how does it affect the styling of the `.myInfoTitle` element?
