I would use a combination of CSS media queries and Angular's `*ngIf` directives or reactive forms to achieve responsiveness. Specifically:

1.  **CSS Media Queries:** I'd define CSS media queries in the componentâ€™s associated CSS or SCSS file to adjust the `width` and `height` styles of the `<highcharts-chart>` element based on different screen sizes. For instance:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .highcharts-chart {
    width: 80px;
    height: 40px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .highcharts-chart {
    width: 60px;
    height: 30px;
  }
}
```

2.  **Angular's `*ngIf` (Conditional Rendering):**  For more significant layout changes, I could conditionally render different chart configurations (different `gaugeChartOptions`) using `*ngIf` based on screen size determined by Angular's `BreakpointObserver`. This is useful if the chart needs to become a simplified version or change its display entirely on smaller screens.

3.  **Reactive Forms & ViewChild:** If the gauge is within a more complex layout managed by a reactive form, I could use `ViewChild` to get a reference to the `highcharts-chart` element and dynamically adjust its size based on changes to the container's dimensions, triggered by events like window resizing or container size adjustments.  This is the most flexible approach but also the most complex.

4.  **Percentage-Based Width:**  A simpler approach would be to set the width of the chart to a percentage (e.g., `width: 50%`) of its parent container. This would allow the chart to scale proportionally with the container's width.  However, fixed height might still be an issue.

I would likely start with percentage-based width and CSS media queries for the simplest solution, and then consider the more complex Angular approaches if finer-grained control is needed.
