To prevent the system from becoming brittle with added profiles, I'd prioritize the following design considerations:

*   **Avoid Conditional Logic in Core Code:**  The core application logic should be independent of which profile is active.  Instead of `if/else` statements scattered throughout the codebase checking for the current profile, I'd prefer a dependency injection approach. The profile would determine *which implementation* of a given interface is injected, not change the behavior of the core logic itself.

*   **Use an Enum for Profiles:** Instead of simple strings, I would replace the `String` constants with an `enum`. This provides type safety, auto-completion, and allows for easier expansion without introducing typos.

*   **Profile-Specific Configuration:**  Instead of hardcoding behavior within the profile definitions, I would favor a configuration mechanism (e.g., properties files, environment variables, or a dedicated configuration service) to provide profile-specific values. This makes it easier to adjust behavior without modifying code.

*   **Factory Pattern:** A factory class or method could be used to instantiate the correct implementation of a service based on the active profile. This encapsulates the profile-specific instantiation logic.

*   **Interface-Based Programming:** Design the system around interfaces. The profiles would determine *which* concrete class implementing the interface is used. This provides flexibility and allows for easier swapping of implementations.
