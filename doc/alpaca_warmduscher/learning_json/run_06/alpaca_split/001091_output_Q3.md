The line `input = Arrays.copyOf(input, input.length)` creates a defensive copy of the input `byte` array.  This is necessary because the `encode` method modifies the `input` array *in-place* within the `divmod` method, which is called within the `encode` loop.

Here's why creating a copy is important:

1. **Preventing Side Effects:** Without creating a copy, the original `input` array passed to the `encode` method would be modified. This could have unintended consequences for the caller of the `encode` method, as it would be surprised to find that the array it passed in has been changed.  Modifying an input parameter is generally considered bad practice unless explicitly documented as part of the method's contract.

2. **Maintaining Immutability:**  Creating a copy helps to maintain the principle of immutability. Immutability means that the original data remains unchanged, which can make code easier to reason about and debug.

3. **Protecting Against Unexpected Behavior:** If the caller was relying on the original `input` array remaining unchanged, modifying it in-place could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in other parts of the application.

By creating a copy using `Arrays.copyOf()`, the `encode` method operates on a separate array, leaving the original `input` array untouched and preventing any unintended side effects.  This makes the `encode` method more robust and predictable.
