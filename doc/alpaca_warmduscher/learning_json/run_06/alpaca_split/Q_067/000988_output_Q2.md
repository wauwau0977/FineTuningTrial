Defining multiple `scope` fields (scope1, scope2, scope3) suggests a need to categorize or filter audit log entries. While this might be a simple solution initially, it introduces several design implications and potential problems as the application evolves.

Problems:

*   **Limited Scalability:** Adding more scopes would require adding more fields, making the class bloated and harder to maintain. The number of scopes is likely to increase over time.
*   **Fixed Structure:** The number of scopes is fixed at three. Any attempt to add or remove scopes would require code changes and database migrations.
*   **Difficult Queries:** Querying based on scopes would require checking multiple fields, potentially leading to complex and inefficient queries.
*   **Lack of Flexibility:**  The meaning of each scope is not explicitly defined in the class itself, making it harder for other developers to understand the purpose of each field.
*   **Potential for Data Integrity Issues:** If the meaning of the scopes changes, it could lead to inconsistent data.

Alternative approaches:

*   **Key-Value Pair (Map):** Use a `Map<String, String>` to store the scopes. This allows for a dynamic number of scopes and eliminates the need for hardcoded fields.
*   **Separate Entity:** Create a separate `AuditLogScope` entity with fields for `logId` and `scopeName`. This provides a more normalized and flexible data structure.
*   **Enum:** If the scopes are predefined and limited, an enum can be used to represent them.
*   **JSON/String Field:** Store the scopes as a JSON string or a comma-separated string in a single field. This provides flexibility but requires parsing and serialization.

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of the application. If the scopes are likely to change frequently or if there is a need for a large number of scopes, a `Map` or a separate entity would be the most scalable and maintainable solutions. If the scopes are predefined and limited, an enum might be sufficient. Using a `Map` or separate entity also allows for easier querying and filtering based on scope values.
