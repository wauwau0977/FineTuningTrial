For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/cache/CachingConfig.java' with name 'CachingConfig.java' where below a part of it is displayed...

```java
@Bean
public CacheManager cacheManager() {
    return new ConcurrentMapCacheManager("sessionDeviceCache");
}
```

What type of `CacheManager` is being instantiated here, and what does the string "sessionDeviceCache" represent? Explain how this configuration impacts performance.
