The `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` variable likely controls how often the entire page (or a significant portion of it) is refreshed. It’s designed to provide a periodic update mechanism. 

The value is calculated as `10 * 60 * 5`, which translates to:
* 10 minutes (in seconds) * 60 seconds/minute * 5. This results in 50 minutes. 

Therefore, `fullPageRefreshInSeconds` is set to 3000 seconds (50 minutes). This suggests that the application periodically refreshes the page every 50 minutes.

The reason for this particular value is likely to fetch updated data from the server that might not be delivered via real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets or Server-Sent Events). It's a fallback mechanism to ensure the user always sees relatively current data, even if the server doesn’t push updates proactively.  It could be related to data that changes infrequently but is still crucial to display accurately.
