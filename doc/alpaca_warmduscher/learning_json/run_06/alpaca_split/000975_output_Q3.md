The use of an interface suggests a focus on abstraction and decoupling.  Rather than defining a concrete implementation with specific details, this interface defines *what* data should be available (the accessors) without specifying *how* that data is stored or retrieved. This allows for multiple concrete classes to implement the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface, each potentially using a different underlying data structure or data source.

The benefits of this approach are:

*   **Flexibility:** Enables easy swapping of implementations without affecting code that relies on the interface.
*   **Testability:** Allows for mocking or stubbing the interface in unit tests, isolating the code under test.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Reduces dependencies between components, making the system more maintainable and adaptable.
*   **Contract Definition:** Clearly defines the data structure and methods that are expected by consuming components.
*   **Polymorphism:** Enables treating different implementations of the interface uniformly through a common interface type.
