For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/services/info/bean/InfoBean.java' with name 'InfoBean.java'... 
Considering the following code snippet: `@Value("${thserver.buildTimestampServer}") private String buildTimestampServer = "";`. How does Spring handle the injection of the `buildTimestampServer` value, and what are the potential drawbacks or considerations when using `@Value` in this manner?
