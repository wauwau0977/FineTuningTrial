For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.spec.ts' with name 'app.component.spec.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
 beforeEach(async () => {
   await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
     imports: [
       RouterTestingModule
     ],
     declarations: [
       AppComponent
     ],
   }).compileComponents();
 });
```
...What is the purpose of the `beforeEach` block in this test suite? Explain what `TestBed.configureTestingModule` does and why it's important for Angular component testing.
