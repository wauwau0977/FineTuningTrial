The `@Param` annotation is a crucial part of Spring Data JPAâ€™s mechanism for binding method parameters to query placeholders.  It explicitly associates a method parameter with a named placeholder in the SQL query. 

In this case, `@Param(value = "measurement_date_start") Date measurementDateStart` tells Spring Data JPA that the `measurementDateStart` variable (of type `Date`) should be bound to the `:measurement_date_start` placeholder in the SQL query. The `value` attribute within `@Param` specifies the name of the placeholder.

Without `@Param`, Spring Data JPA might not be able to correctly determine which parameter corresponds to which placeholder, especially if there are multiple parameters or if the parameter names don't directly match the placeholder names.  This annotation ensures that the correct values are substituted into the query at runtime, preventing potential errors and ensuring accurate data retrieval.  Spring Data JPA uses reflection and the information provided by `@Param` to handle the binding process.
