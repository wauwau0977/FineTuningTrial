The linked CSS stylesheets from Google Fonts (Roboto) and Material Icons are used to enhance the application's visual appearance and provide a consistent user interface. Roboto is a widely used font that offers readability and a modern aesthetic, while Material Icons provide a library of scalable vector icons that can be easily integrated into the application's components.

However, relying on external CDNs does have potential drawbacks:

*   **Dependency on External Services:** If Google's servers are down or experience issues, the fonts and icons might not load, impacting the application's appearance or functionality.
*   **Performance:** Although CDNs often offer caching, there's still a network request to fetch the CSS files. This can add to the initial load time.
*   **Privacy Concerns:**  Loading resources from third-party CDNs can raise privacy concerns, as the CDN provider might track user requests.
*   **Control:** You have limited control over the content served from external CDNs.

Mitigation strategies include:

*   **Caching:** Browser caching effectively reduces the impact of CDN downtime.
*   **Fallback Fonts/Icons:** Providing local fallback fonts and icons to display if the CDN resources fail to load.
*   **Self-Hosting:** Downloading the font/icon files and hosting them locally on the server, eliminating the dependency on external services, but increasing server storage and maintenance.
