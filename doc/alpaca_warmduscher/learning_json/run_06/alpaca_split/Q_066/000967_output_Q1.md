The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation specifies the order in which the properties of an object implementing the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface should be serialized into a JSON string.  

Without this annotation, the Jackson library would serialize the properties in the order they are defined in the getter methods (or based on reflection heuristics).  `@JsonPropertyOrder` overrides this default behavior. 

Specifically, it ensures the following properties appear in this order in the JSON output:

1.  `measurementDateStart`
2.  `measurementDateEnd`
3.  `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`
4.  `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`
5.  `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`
6.  `compressorState`
7.  `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`

This is useful for:

*   **Consistency:** Ensuring a consistent JSON structure across all API responses.
*   **Compatibility:** Maintaining compatibility with systems that expect a specific JSON format.
*   **Readability:** Improving the readability of the JSON output for debugging or human consumption.
*   **Performance:** In some cases, a defined order can slightly improve parsing performance on the client side.
