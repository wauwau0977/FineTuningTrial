The current implementation filters the `result` list on the Java level using a stream and the `stationIdList`. This has significant performance implications, especially if the database returns a large number of records before filtering.  The entire dataset is loaded into memory, and then the filtering is performed, which is inefficient.  The code even acknowledges this with the comment: "// filter on java level (less efficient), as DB side filtering seems to be tricky..."

**Better Alternative:**

The optimal solution is to perform the filtering directly in the database query. However, the code mentions difficulty implementing this with a full optional parameter.

To address the optional parameter issue, consider the following approaches:

1.  **Dynamic SQL with a `WHERE` clause:**  Build the SQL query dynamically using a `WHERE` clause that includes `station_id IN (:stationIdList)` only if `stationIdList` is not empty.
2.  **Database-Specific Features:** Leverage database-specific features such as `COALESCE` or conditional expressions within the `WHERE` clause to handle the optional parameter elegantly.  For example, you could use `WHERE station_id = COALESCE(:stationIdList, station_id)` if the database supports it.
3. **Multiple Queries:**  If the dynamic SQL approach is overly complex, consider executing multiple queries, one with a `WHERE` clause that includes `station_id` and another one without it.  You can then combine the results.  This is generally less efficient than a single query, but it can be a viable alternative.

By filtering the data directly in the database, the amount of data transferred over the network is reduced, and the filtering process is performed more efficiently by the database server. This significantly improves performance and scalability.
