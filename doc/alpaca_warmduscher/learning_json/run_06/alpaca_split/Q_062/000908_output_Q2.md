The primary purpose of overriding the `toString()` method is to provide a human-readable string representation of the object. The default `toString()` implementation (inherited from `Object`) typically returns something like "SessionDevice@1a2b3c4d," which isn't very informative.

In the context of a database entity like `SessionDevice`, overriding `toString()` is immensely useful for several reasons:

*   **Debugging:** When debugging, you often need to inspect the values of objects. A well-defined `toString()` method makes it much easier to understand the object's state by providing a clear, concise representation of its attributes. Instead of having to manually print each attribute, you can simply print the object itself.

*   **Logging:** If you're logging information about `SessionDevice` instances, the `toString()` method provides a convenient way to generate meaningful log messages.

*   **Testing:** During unit testing, you can use the `toString()` method to assert the expected values of object attributes.

*   **Monitoring/Admin Tools:**  If you're using monitoring or admin tools that display object data, the `toString()` method provides a standardized way to format the output.

In this specific implementation, the `toString()` method includes the `sessionId`, `agentString`, `clientId`, and `ip` attributes, providing a useful snapshot of the session device's relevant information.
