For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/data/meteoswiss/MeteoDataService.java' with name 'MeteoDataService.java' we have the following question: 

Imagine you need to add error handling to the `MeteoDataService` interface.  Modify the interface to include a way to signal failures in both `init()` and `getData()`.  You should aim for a clean, informative, and extensible approach.  Describe the changes you would make and provide the updated interface definition.  Focus on how the calling code would *receive* information about failures.
