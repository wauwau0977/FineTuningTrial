For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/dao/meteoswiss/MeteoSwissRepository.java' with name 'MeteoSwissRepository.java'... 
Considering the `getLastEntries` method: What are the potential implications of ordering by `temperature_measure_date desc` without a defined index on that column in the `meteo_swiss` table? How would you address this to improve query performance?
