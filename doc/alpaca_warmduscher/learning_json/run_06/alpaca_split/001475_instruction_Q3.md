For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/resources/static/index.html' with name 'index.html' where below a part of it is displayed...
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#424242">
 <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="#424242">
```
What is the purpose of these two `<meta>` tags, and how do they affect the user experience on different devices?
