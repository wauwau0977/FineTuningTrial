For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/test/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/PhysicsTest.java' with name 'PhysicsTest.java' we have the following question: 
Describe the purpose of the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` test method. Specifically, detail what inputs are used, what the expected outputs are (within a range), and how the assertions verify the correctness of the function being tested. Explain the logic behind the test cases â€“ what scenarios are being validated, and why those specific values are chosen. Finally, provide the exact code of the `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` method that would pass these tests.
