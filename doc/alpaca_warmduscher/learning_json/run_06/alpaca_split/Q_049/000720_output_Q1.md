`List.of(entity)` creates an immutable list. This means that after the list is created, you cannot add, remove, or modify any of its elements. Attempting to do so will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

This immutability has several implications:

*   **Thread Safety:** Immutable lists are inherently thread-safe, eliminating the need for synchronization when multiple threads access the data.
*   **Predictability:** The consumer of the list can rely on the data not changing unexpectedly.
*   **Defensive Copying:** If the consumer attempts to modify the list, an exception will be thrown, preventing accidental data corruption.

In this scenario, the benefits are significant.  Because this is a mock implementation, and we are generating data, the application likely doesn't need to *modify* the returned data. Returning an immutable list adds a layer of safety and prevents unintended side effects. If the application *did* need to modify the data, a different list implementation (e.g., `ArrayList`) would be necessary.
