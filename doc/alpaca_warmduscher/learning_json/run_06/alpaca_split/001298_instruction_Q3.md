For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
@Component
public class CorsFilter implements Filter {
    // ... filter methods ...
}
```

What does the `@Component` annotation signify in this code, and how does it relate to the broader architecture of the 'Warmduscher' application, assuming a Spring framework context?
