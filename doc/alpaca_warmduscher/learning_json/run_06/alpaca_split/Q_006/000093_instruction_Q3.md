For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app-routing.module.ts' with name 'app-routing.module.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```typescript
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

What is the purpose of the `AppRoutingModule` class, and why is it seemingly empty? What role does it play in the overall Angular application structure?
