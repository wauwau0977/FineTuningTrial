You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a custom exception class `ThException` extending `RuntimeException`. It provides a mechanism for handling exceptions specific to the 'Warmduscher' project, allowing for more tailored error management and reporting.  It provides constructors to create exceptions with just a message, or with a message *and* an underlying cause.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/ThException.java
- **Class Name(s):** `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.ThException`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations:** Define a custom exception class.
- **User Inputs & Outputs:**  The class itself doesn't take direct user input. It's *instantiated* by other parts of the code, providing a way to signal errors. Outputs are exception objects that can be caught and handled.
- **Workflow/Logic:** The class primarily acts as a container for exception information (message and potentially a root cause).  The constructors initialize these fields by calling the superclass (`RuntimeException`) constructor.
- **External Interactions:** None. This is a simple exception class and does not interact with any external systems.
- **Edge Cases Handling:**  The class handles the basic case of providing a custom exception type. The presence of the `Throwable cause` constructor allows for wrapping existing exceptions, providing context.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  Minimal overhead as it’s a simple exception class. Instantiation is quick.
- **Scalability:**  Not directly related to scalability. However, consistent exception handling contributes to overall system stability.
- **Security:**  Not directly related to security.
- **Maintainability:**  Simple class, easy to understand and maintain.
- **Reliability & Availability:**  Contributes to reliability by providing a structured way to handle errors.
- **Usability:** Improves code readability and error handling clarity.
- **Compliance:**  Complies with standard Java exception handling practices.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions:**
    - `ThException(String message)`: Constructor that initializes the exception with a message.
    - `ThException(String message, Throwable cause)`: Constructor that initializes the exception with a message and a root cause.
- **Important logic flows:** The logic flow is simply initialization of the `RuntimeException` superclass with the provided message and/or cause.
- **Error handling:** The class *is* an error handling mechanism. It's intended to be thrown and caught by other parts of the application.
- **Classes:** No subclasses are defined.
- **Modules:**  This class is a utility class and doesn't represent a module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Exception Handling:**  Utilizes Java’s built-in exception handling mechanisms ( `throw`, `try-catch`).
- **Object-Oriented Programming:**  Inheritance (extends `RuntimeException`).
- **String manipulation:** Uses String objects for exception messages.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- None.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- None.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Custom Exception Codes:** Consider adding an integer or enum-based exception code to the class. This can aid in programmatically identifying and handling specific errors.
- **Logging Integration:** Integrate with a logging framework to automatically log exceptions when they are thrown.
- **Categorization:** If the project grows, consider a hierarchy of custom exceptions to better categorize errors (e.g., `DatabaseException`, `NetworkException`).  This could be achieved via subclassing `ThException`.
