Providing a default implementation in an interface, as seen with `getId()`, offers a balance between interface contract and implementation convenience. The benefit is that classes implementing the interface *don't* necessarily have to provide their own `getId()` method. This can simplify implementation for basic cases, reduce boilerplate, and allow for evolutionary design where we can add functionality to the default implementation without breaking existing implementations.

However, the drawback is reduced flexibility. If a class *needs* a different way of generating the ID, it's forced to override the default implementation. More importantly, it introduces a degree of coupling. Clients relying on this interface might unintentionally depend on the specific ID generation logic within the default method. If we later need to change the ID generation process, it might require updating all implementations, even those that were previously happy with the default.

In this case, using `UUIDUtils.generateShortTextUUID()` within the interface makes sense *if* a default UUID generation is acceptable for the vast majority of implementations. But, if there's a reasonable expectation that different implementations might require customized ID schemes (e.g., database sequence-based IDs, client-provided IDs), it would be better to *remove* the default implementation and force implementing classes to provide their own. This would maintain greater flexibility and reduce potential future coupling issues. The current design is reasonable as long as the default ID generation is generally suitable and not expected to change frequently.
