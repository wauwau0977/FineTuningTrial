The logic behind using `ntile()` for grouping by a fixed number of rows is to divide the entire dataset into a specified number of groups (defined by the `:maxRows` parameter), ensuring that each group contains approximately the same number of rows.  `ntile(N)` assigns each row a bucket number from 1 to N, based on its position within the sorted dataset. In this method, it's used as an alternative to grouping by a time interval.

The benefits of using `ntile()` compared to other grouping methods are:

*   **Fixed Group Size:** It guarantees a fixed number of rows per group, regardless of the data distribution or time intervals.
*   **Even Distribution:** It aims to distribute the data evenly across the groups, ensuring that each group represents a relatively equal proportion of the dataset.
*   **Flexibility:**  It allows grouping the data based on a logical count rather than a time constraint, which can be useful for analyzing data with irregular time intervals or varying data density.

However, potential drawbacks when using `ntile()` in this context include:

*   **Data Fragmentation:** Rows belonging to the same compressor runtime might be distributed across different groups, potentially obscuring meaningful patterns or correlations. It doesnâ€™t respect the inherent time series nature of the data.
*   **Boundary Effects:** Rows near the boundaries between groups might not be representative of the overall group characteristics.
*   **Loss of Time Series Information**: By grouping solely on row count, temporal relationships and trends within the data are lost.
*   **Arbitrary Grouping**: The grouping is purely based on row count and might not align with any meaningful operational or physical characteristics of the heat pump system.

In this specific scenario, where the goal is to analyze compressor performance, using `ntile()` for grouping could lead to less meaningful results compared to grouping by time intervals. It's better suited for situations where the order or timing of the data is not critical, and the primary goal is to divide the dataset into a fixed number of segments for analysis.
