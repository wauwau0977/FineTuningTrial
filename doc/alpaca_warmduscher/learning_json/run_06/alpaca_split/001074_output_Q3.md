The `modbusMasterSynced.requestOperation()` block is responsible for encapsulating the Modbus communication logic and ensuring thread-safe access to the `modbusMaster` instance.  It takes a `Consumer` functional interface as an argument, which contains the code that reads data from the Modbus device.

The `GlobalSynced` class, combined with the `Hooks` implementation, provides the thread safety. Specifically:

1.  **Synchronization:** The `GlobalSynced` class likely uses internal locking mechanisms to ensure that only one thread can execute the code within the `requestOperation` block at a time. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads try to read or write to the Modbus device simultaneously.
2.  **Connection Management:** The `Hooks` interface allows for pre- and post-operation actions. In this case, the `before()` hook ensures the Modbus connection is established if it's not already connected, and the `after()` hook disconnects the connection after the operation completes.  This ensures that the connection is properly managed and released.  Without these hooks, the connection could be left open unnecessarily or be in an inconsistent state.
3.  **Resource Management:** By encapsulating the communication logic within `requestOperation()`, the class manages the lifecycle of the `modbusMaster` resource, preventing potential resource leaks or corruption.

In essence, `modbusMasterSynced` acts as a wrapper around the `modbusMaster` instance, providing a thread-safe mechanism for accessing and communicating with the Modbus device. This ensures the stability and reliability of the data acquisition process.
