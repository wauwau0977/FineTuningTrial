For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/environments/environment.prod.ts' with name 'environment.prod.ts' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```typescript
export const environment = {
 production: true,
 serviceBaseURL: ".",
 fullPageRefreshInSeconcs: 60 * 60 * 24,
 "buildTimestampClient": "v01-20220220-093352"
};
```
What is the purpose of the `production: true` property within this configuration? What impact does setting this to `true` typically have on the application's behavior?
