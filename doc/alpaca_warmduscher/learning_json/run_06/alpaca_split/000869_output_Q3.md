The `CrudRepository` interface is a standard Spring Data JPA interface that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database entities. It extends the `Repository` interface and automatically provides methods for common database interactions without requiring you to write the corresponding SQL or JPA code explicitly.

Specifically, it provides methods like:

*   `save()`: Saves an entity to the database.
*   `findById()`: Retrieves an entity by its ID.
*   `findAll()`: Retrieves all entities.
*   `deleteById()`: Deletes an entity by its ID.
*   `delete()`: Deletes an entity.
*   `count()`: Returns the total number of entities.

In this code, `MeteoSwissStatsRepository extends CrudRepository<MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity, String>`, which indicates that this repository manages entities of type `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity`. The `String` type parameter specifies that the primary key of the `MeteoSwissStatisticsEntity` is a `String`. The repository automatically provides the standard CRUD operations for this entity, allowing you to interact with the `meteo_swiss_statistics` table in the database.
