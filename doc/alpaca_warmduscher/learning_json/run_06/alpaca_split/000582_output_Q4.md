Removing `::ng-deep` requires understanding *why* it was used in the first place: to style elements within a Material Design `<mat-card-header>` that are part of another component.  Here's how I'd approach it:

1. **Identify the Component Owning the `<mat-card-header>`:**  The first step is to pinpoint which Angular component is rendering the `<mat-card-header>` element that needs styling. Let's call this the "header component".

2. **Expose Input Properties:** The ideal solution is to make the styling customizable through input properties on the "header component".  I'd add an `@Input()` property to the "header component" that allows the parent component (the one containing `overview-current.component`) to control the `margin-left` and `margin-bottom` of the `.mat-card-header-text` element. This might look like:

   ```typescript
   @Input() textMarginLeft: string = '0';
   @Input() textMarginBottom: string = '10px';
   ```

3.  **Modify the Header Component's Template:**  Inside the "header component's" template, the `.mat-card-header-text` element's style would be modified to use the input properties:

    ```html
    <mat-card-header-text [style.margin-left]="textMarginLeft" [style.margin-bottom]="textMarginBottom">
      </mat-card-header-text>
    ```

4. **Update the Parent Component (`overview-current.component`):**  In the `overview-current.component`'s template, when the `<mat-card-header>` is rendered, pass the desired values for the input properties:

    ```html
    <mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-header-text [textMarginLeft]="'0'" [textMarginBottom]="'10px'">
       </mat-card-header-text>
    </mat-card-header>
    ```

**Why this works:** This approach moves the styling responsibility from the current component (`overview-current.component`) to the component that actually *owns* the element being styled (the "header component").  By using input properties, the parent component can *configure* the header's appearance without relying on potentially problematic and deprecated styling techniques like `::ng-deep`.  This adheres to the principles of component encapsulation and makes the application more maintainable.
