For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' we have the following question: 
Imagine you are tasked with creating a concrete implementation of the `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface. Describe the data types you would use to store the underlying data for each of the interface's getter methods. Explain *why* you chose those specific data types, considering potential values and precision requirements. Also, briefly discuss how you would handle scenarios where data might be missing (e.g., a sensor temporarily unavailable).
