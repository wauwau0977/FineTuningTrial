The `BeanUtils` class, while providing a useful function, introduces potential risks:

1. **Runtime Errors:** Autowiring at runtime can fail if dependencies are not properly registered within the Spring context. This results in `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` or similar errors, occurring after the application is running, making debugging harder.
2. **Circular Dependencies:** If the bean being autowired has circular dependencies, the `autowireBean` method might get stuck in an infinite loop or throw an exception. Standard Spring handles circular dependencies during bean creation more gracefully.
3. **Hidden Dependencies:** This approach can hide dependencies within the code. Itâ€™s not immediately clear what dependencies a particular bean requires just by looking at its declaration.
4. **State Management:** If the bean being autowired has complex state, autowiring it mid-lifecycle could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior if the dependencies modify that state in an unintended way.
5. **Testing Difficulties:**  It makes unit testing harder because you need to ensure the Spring context is properly configured before you can test the code that uses this class. Mocking and isolating dependencies become more complicated.
