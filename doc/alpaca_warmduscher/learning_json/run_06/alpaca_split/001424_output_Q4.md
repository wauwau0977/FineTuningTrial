```java
   @RequestMapping("/memory")
   @ResponseBody
   public MemoryInfo getMemoryInfo() {
       return MemoryInfo.getCurrent();
   }
```

The `getMemoryInfo` method is a Spring MVC controller method that handles requests to the `/memory` endpoint. It's purpose is to retrieve and return current system memory information.

It achieves this by calling the static `getCurrent()` method on the `MemoryInfo` class.  This `getCurrent()` method (presumably) gathers the necessary system memory data. The `getMemoryInfo` method then returns the `MemoryInfo` object created by `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()`.

The `@RequestMapping("/memory")` annotation maps HTTP requests to `/memory` to this method. The `@ResponseBody` annotation indicates that the return value of the method should be serialized and returned as the body of the HTTP response. The method does not have any local variables, arguments or perform any operation except call the static `MemoryInfo.getCurrent()` method and return the result.
