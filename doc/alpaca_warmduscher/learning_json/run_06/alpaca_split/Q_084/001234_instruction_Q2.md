For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java' with name 'Hooks.java'... 
Imagine you're writing a unit test for a component that *uses* this `Hooks` interface.  Specifically, you want to test that the `before` and `after` hooks are called correctly with the expected data. Given the interface definition, how would you approach mocking or stubbing the `Hooks` instance in your test? Provide a code snippet illustrating your approach using a common mocking framework (e.g., Mockito).
