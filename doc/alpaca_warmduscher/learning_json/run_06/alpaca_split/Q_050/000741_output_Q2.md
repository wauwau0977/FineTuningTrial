The current implementation of `getData` makes sequential API calls for each `stationId`. This can become a significant performance bottleneck as the number of stations increases, due to:

1.  **Network Latency:** Each API call incurs network latency.  With a large number of stations, the cumulative latency can significantly slow down the overall data retrieval process.
2.  **API Rate Limiting:** The MeteoSwiss API might have rate limits, restricting the number of requests that can be made within a certain timeframe. Making sequential requests increases the risk of hitting these limits, leading to errors and delays.
3.  **Blocking Operations:** Each `callService` operation is a blocking operation.  The application is idle while waiting for the response from the API for each station.

To improve performance, I would recommend using asynchronous and parallel processing. Here's how I would modify the code:

1.  **Use `CompletableFuture`:**  Use `CompletableFuture` to make asynchronous API calls for each station. This allows multiple requests to be sent concurrently without blocking the main thread.

2.  **Parallel Stream:** Use a parallel stream to process the `stationIds` and initiate the asynchronous calls.

Here's an example of how the modified `getData` method might look:

```java
public List<MeteoSwissEntity> getData() {
    long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    log.info("About to query the MeteoSwiss service for live temperature, sunshine and windgust info.");

    List<CompletableFuture<MeteoSwissEntity>> futures = stationIds.parallelStream()
            .map(stationId -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                String sunshineJSON = callService(urlSunshine);
                String temperatureJSON = callService(urlTemperature);
                String windGustJSON = callService(urlWindGust);

                MeteoSwissEntity entity = new MeteoSwissEntity();
                entity.setStationId(stationId);
                ResDateValue sunshine = extractFromJSON(sunshineJSON, stationId, null);
                entity.setSunshine(sunshine.getValue1());
                entity.setSunshineMeasureDate(sunshine.getMeasurementDate());
                ResDateValue temperature = extractFromJSON(temperatureJSON, stationId, null);
                entity.setTemperature(temperature.getValue1());
                entity.setTemperatureMeasureDate(temperature.getMeasurementDate());
                ResDateValue windGust = extractFromJSON(windGustJSON, stationId, "wind_direction");
                entity.setWindGustSpeed(windGust.getValue1());
                entity.setWindDirection(windGust.getValue2());
                entity.setWindMeasureDate(windGust.getMeasurementDate());
                entity.setStationName(temperature.getStationName());
                return entity;
            }))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    List<MeteoSwissEntity> entities = futures.stream()
            .map(CompletableFuture::join) // Block and get the results
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    long dtServiceMeteoSwiss = System.currentTimeMillis() - t0;
    log.info("MeteoSwiss data polling completed. "
            + "dt[ms]=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0)
            + " dtServiceMeteoSwiss=" + dtServiceMeteoSwiss
            + " numberOfStations=" + stationIds.size()
            + " stationIds:" + stationIds);

    return entities;
}
```

This approach significantly reduces the overall data retrieval time by making concurrent API calls.  It also helps avoid hitting API rate limits.  Note that appropriate error handling and resource management should be added within the `supplyAsync` lambda to ensure the robustness of the solution.  Consider using a fixed thread pool for the `CompletableFuture` to control resource consumption.
