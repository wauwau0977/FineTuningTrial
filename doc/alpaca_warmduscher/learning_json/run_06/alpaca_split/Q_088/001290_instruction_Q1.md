For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/CorsFilter.java' with name 'CorsFilter.java'... 
Considering potential performance implications, what are the trade-offs of adding these CORS headers to *every* request, even those originating from the same origin? Could there be a more efficient approach to applying CORS filtering in this application?
