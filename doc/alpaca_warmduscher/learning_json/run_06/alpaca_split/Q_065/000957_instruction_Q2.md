For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/BoilerStatsByHour.java' with name 'BoilerStatsByHour.java'... 
Considering the use of `@JsonPropertyOrder({"hourOfTheDay", "sumBoilerDiffDecrease", "sumBoilerDiffIncrease", "numOfStatisticRecords1"})`, what potential issues might arise if the underlying data source for populating this interface changes and the order of fields in that source is different? How would you mitigate these issues?
