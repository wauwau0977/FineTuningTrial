You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This Java class `ThserverApplication` serves as the main entry point for the 'Warmduscher' application. It's a Spring Boot application that initializes various components, logs startup information including memory usage and server details, and persists this information to an audit log. It also sets the default timezone to Europe/Zurich. A scheduled task runs once after application initialization to record detailed startup information.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/ThserverApplication.java
- **Class Name(s):** `ThserverApplication`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**:
    - Initialize the Spring Boot application.
    - Set the default timezone.
    - Log application startup information.
    - Persist startup information to an audit log.

- **User Inputs & Outputs**:
    - **Inputs**: Command-line arguments passed to the application (handled by Spring Boot).
    - **Outputs**:
        - Log messages (printed to console/log file).
        - Audit log entries stored in a database.

- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. The `main` method is executed, initializing the Spring Boot application and setting the timezone.
    2. The application context is created and all Spring beans are initialized.
    3. After a delay of 50ms, the `logStartup` scheduled task is executed only once.
    4. `logStartup` collects startup details (startup times, memory info, server info).
    5. The collected details are converted to JSON.
    6. An `AuditLogEntity` is created with the collected information.
    7. The `AuditLogEntity` is saved to the database via `AuditLogRepository`.

- **External Interactions**:
    - Database interaction: The application interacts with a database to store audit log entries using the `AuditLogRepository`.
    - Logging: Uses SLF4J for logging.

- **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - Database connection errors: The application should handle potential database connection errors gracefully (implementation detail not apparent in this code).
    - JSON serialization errors: While not explicitly handled, serialization failures within `Utils.toJSON()` would likely result in an exception.
    - Timezone setting failure: The `TimeZone.setDefault()` should handle invalid timezone strings gracefully.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The startup logging should not significantly impact the application's startup time. The initial delay of 50ms is small and should be sufficient.
- **Scalability**: The scalability is not directly addressed in this code but depends on the underlying database and other components.
- **Security**: The code doesn't explicitly address security concerns. Data protection and authentication are likely handled by other components of the application.
- **Maintainability**: The code is relatively simple and easy to understand. The use of dependency injection enhances modularity.
- **Reliability & Availability**: The reliability and availability depend on the underlying database and other components.
- **Usability**:  N/A - this is a backend component.
- **Compliance**: N/A.

## 5. Key Components

- **`ThserverApplication` class**:  The main entry point for the application, responsible for initialization and startup logging.
- **`logStartup()` method**: Scheduled task that collects and logs startup information.
- **`AuditLogRepository`**: Interface for accessing and persisting audit log data.
- **`InfoBean`**: Bean containing server information.
- **`StartupData`**: Bean containing startup times.
- **`Utils.toJSON()`**: Utility method for converting objects to JSON strings.
- **Important logic flows**: The primary logic flow is the initialization and the single execution of the `logStartup` scheduled task.
- **Error handling**: Basic exception handling is not directly present in the code, but relies on Spring Boot's default exception handling.
- **Classes**: No subclasses defined.
- **Modules**: The code belongs to the `thserver` module within the 'Warmduscher' project.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features
- Data structures: `Map`, `TreeMap`.
- Timezone handling.
- Logging.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- **Spring Boot**: Used for dependency injection, auto-configuration, and web service handling.
- **SLF4J**: Used for logging.
- **Spring Scheduling**: Used for scheduling tasks via the `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` annotations.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.dao.audit.AuditLogRepository`**: Interface for persisting audit log entries.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.audit.AuditLogEntity`**: Entity representing an audit log entry.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.device.service.HeatingDataReadService`**:  Injected but not actually used in the provided code snippet.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.Utils`**: Utility class containing the `toJSON` method.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.spring.StartupData`**: Bean containing startup times.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.InfoBean`**: Bean containing server information.
- **`com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.web.services.info.bean.MemoryInfo`**: Bean containing memory information.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements:** Consider asynchronous logging to avoid blocking the startup process.
- **Code Readability:**  The code is already relatively readable.
- **Security Improvements:** Ensure proper database access controls and data validation.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Investigate caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- **Error Handling**: Add explicit error handling (try-catch blocks) around database operations and JSON serialization to improve robustness.
- **Logging Context**: Add more context to log messages, such as thread IDs or request IDs, for easier debugging.
- **Configuration**: Externalize the audit log level and other configuration parameters.
