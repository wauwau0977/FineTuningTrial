The `getSoleDeltaInOperationStats` method includes a significant amount of logic to handle compressor runtime and filter out initial startup and shutdown phases. Describe the purpose of the `seq_id` column and how it is used to identify periods when the compressor is running. What potential issues could arise from relying on this approach for detecting compressor state?
