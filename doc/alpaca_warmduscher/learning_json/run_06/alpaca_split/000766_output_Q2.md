The use of `count(1) over ()` within the `findBetweenDatesLimitByFixedIntervalStats` method’s nested query serves a very specific purpose: it calculates the total number of records within the entire dataset *without* aggregating the results. It essentially adds a column to each row that represents the total count, allowing for calculations within the same row based on this total.

Here's a detailed explanation and how it differs from `count(*)`:

*   **`count(1) over ()` (Window Function):** This is a window function. Window functions calculate a value for each row in the result set *without* grouping the rows. The `over ()` clause indicates that the count should be calculated over the entire result set.  This means that every row in the output will have a column that represents the total number of records. The result is that *every row* receives the total count as a column.
*   **`count(*)` (Aggregate Function):** This is an aggregate function. Aggregate functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value. Typically, it’s used with a `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of rows within each group. If used without `GROUP BY`, it returns the total count for the entire table/query result, but *collapses* all the rows into a single row containing only the count.

**Why use `count(1) over ()` in this context?**

The intention is to have the total record count available on *every* row, allowing the downstream calculations to potentially normalize values or perform calculations based on the total dataset size without needing to join or re-query the data.  

In this case, adding a column with the total number of records might be used for calculating percentages or weighted averages later in the query pipeline or within the application logic. Essentially, it prepares the data for more complex calculations that require the overall dataset size without altering the row count.
