The `checkPerformance` test method aims to evaluate the performance (speed) of the `Base58BitcoinFlavor.encode()` and `Base58BitcoinFlavor.decode()` methods when processing a large number of byte arrays.

The metric used to quantify the performance is the time it takes to perform 1000 encoding/decoding cycles.  Specifically, the test measures the total execution time (`dt`) for 1000 iterations and then calculates the average time taken for a single encoding/decoding operation (`1.0 * dt / loops`).  This average time (in milliseconds) is printed to the console, providing an indication of the performance of the `Base58BitcoinFlavor` class.
