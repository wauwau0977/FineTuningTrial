The `getData` method serves as the primary interface for retrieving the current heating data represented as a `HeatPumpEntity`. It encapsulates the process of collecting data from the heat pump and assembling it into a structured object.

**Purpose:** The primary goal of this method is to obtain the most recent or current snapshot of data from the heat pump. This involves potentially coordinating calls to other methods within the service (like `scanAllRegisters`) to read raw data, processing that data, and populating a `HeatPumpEntity` object.

**Return Value:**
*   `HeatPumpEntity`: The method returns an instance of the `HeatPumpEntity` class. This object contains all the relevant data points captured from the heat pump (e.g., temperature readings, operating status, power consumption, error codes). The specific attributes of the `HeatPumpEntity` would define the scope of data accessible through this service.

**Potential Exceptions:**
*   `Throwable`: This is a very broad exception type, which suggests that a variety of errors could occur during the data retrieval process. Common possibilities include:
    *   `Exception`: A general exception covering communication failures, data parsing errors, or internal service errors.
    *   `IOException`: If there are problems communicating with the heat pump during data acquisition.
    *   `IllegalStateException`: If the service hasn’t been properly initialized (e.g., `init()` hasn’t been called).
    *   `DataProcessingException` (custom): A specific exception indicating an error during data processing (e.g., invalid data format).

**Usage in Context:**

This method would likely be used as the entry point for obtaining heating data. A typical scenario would involve:

1.  Calling `init()` to initialize the service and establish communication with the heat pump.
2.  Calling `getData()` to retrieve the current `HeatPumpEntity`.
3.  Accessing the attributes of the `HeatPumpEntity` to extract the desired data points.
4.  The returned `HeatPumpEntity` could then be used for visualization, analysis, or control purposes.

The use of `Throwable` as the exception type implies that the developers anticipate a wide range of potential errors and want to provide a flexible error handling mechanism.
