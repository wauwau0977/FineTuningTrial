For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/web/MyRequestInterceptor.java' with name 'MyRequestInterceptor.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 
```java
   private final SessionRequestRepository sessionRequestRepository;
   public MyRequestInterceptor(SessionRequestRepository sessionRequestRepository) {
       this.sessionRequestRepository = sessionRequestRepository;
   }
```
What is the purpose of this code snippet, and why is dependency injection used here?
