The `.chartItem` class defines the styling for a container element intended to hold chart-related content. Here's a breakdown of the styling:

*   **`margin-right: -15px`**:  Applies a negative right margin of 15 pixels.  This effectively overlaps the element with its adjacent sibling to the right, creating a tighter layout and potentially removing some spacing.
*   **`margin-left: -15px`**: Applies a negative left margin of 15 pixels. This does the same as above, but on the left side, overlapping with the element to its left.
*   **`display: flex`**:  Enables flexbox layout for the element. This allows for easy alignment and distribution of child elements within the `.chartItem`.
*   **`align-items: center`**:  Vertically aligns the child elements to the center of the `.chartItem`.
*   **`justify-content: center`**: Horizontally aligns the child elements to the center of the `.chartItem`.

The combination of these styles creates a layout where the child elements are centered both vertically and horizontally within the `.chartItem` container. The negative margins are specifically used to create an overlapping arrangement, potentially reducing gaps between chart items when displayed in a row or column. It appears the intent is to create a denser, more tightly packed chart item layout.
