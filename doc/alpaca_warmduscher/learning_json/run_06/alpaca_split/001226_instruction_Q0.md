You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This code defines a functional interface `Hooks<T>` which allows for the registration of callback functions to be executed before and after an operation involving a generic type `T`. This pattern is designed for implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, timing, or pre/post-processing actions around a core operation without modifying the core operation's code directly. It's a simple interface providing `before` and `after` hooks.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/mutex/Hooks.java
- **Class Name(s):** `Hooks<T>`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Define a contract for before and after hooks to be executed around an operation on a generic type `T`.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**:  The interface doesn't handle direct user input or output. It expects an instance of type `T` to be passed to the `before` and `after` methods. The methods themselves can potentially produce output (e.g., logging) or modify the input `T` object, though this is determined by the implementation of the hooks.
- **Workflow/Logic**:
    1. A client implements the `Hooks<T>` interface to provide custom before and after logic.
    2. The client registers an instance of the `Hooks<T>` implementation with a system/service that manages the operations on `T`.
    3. Before the operation on `T` is executed, the `before(T t)` method of the registered `Hooks` instance is called.
    4. The operation on `T` is executed.
    5. After the operation on `T` is executed, the `after(T t)` method of the registered `Hooks` instance is called.
- **External Interactions**:  No direct external interactions. The interactions occur internally within the system utilizing this interface.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: The `before` and `after` methods declare that they `throws Throwable`. This allows implementations to handle exceptions that might occur during hook execution.  The system utilizing this interface is responsible for handling any exceptions thrown by the hooks.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Minimal performance impact as it's a simple interface. The performance impact will be determined by the complexity of the hook implementations.
- **Scalability**: Inherently scalable, as the interface is lightweight. Scalability is dependent on the implementations of the `before` and `after` methods.
- **Security**: Not directly related to security, but hook implementations could involve security-sensitive operations (e.g., authorization checks).
- **Maintainability**: Highly maintainable due to its simplicity and clear separation of concerns.
- **Reliability & Availability**:  Reliability depends on the implementations of the hooks. The interface itself doesn't introduce reliability issues.
- **Usability**:  Easy to use and integrate due to its simple contract.
- **Compliance**: Not directly related to any specific compliance requirements.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `before(T t)`:  This method is called before the operation on type `T`. It receives an instance of `T` as input.
    - `after(T t)`: This method is called after the operation on type `T`. It receives an instance of `T` as input.
- **Important logic flows**: The interface defines a simple "before-operation-after" flow.
- **Error handling**: Both methods declare they throw `Throwable`, allowing implementations to handle errors within the hooks.
- **Classes**: This is an interface, so it doesn't have subclasses.
- **Modules**:  Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.utils.mutex` package, likely intended for utilities related to synchronization and locking within the `thserver` application.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- **Generics**: Used to define the type parameter `T`, allowing the interface to work with any data type.
- **Interfaces**: The code defines an interface.
- **Exception Handling**: Uses `throws Throwable` to declare that methods can throw exceptions.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries

- No external frameworks or libraries are directly used in this code.

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies

- Likely dependent on other utilities or modules within the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver` project, but no specific dependencies are apparent from this code snippet alone.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **More Specific Exceptions:** Instead of throwing `Throwable`, consider defining a more specific exception type for hook-related errors. This would allow the calling code to handle different types of errors more gracefully.
- **Context Object**: Consider passing a context object to the `before` and `after` methods, in addition to the object of type `T`. This context could contain additional information relevant to the operation, such as a timestamp, user ID, or request ID.
- **Logging Integration**:  The hook implementations could integrate with a logging framework to provide more detailed information about the operation and any errors that occur.
