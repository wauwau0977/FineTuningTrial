For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/app.component.ts' with name 'app.component.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the purpose and functionality of the `AppComponent` class. Specifically, explain how the full page refresh mechanism is implemented, including the role of `environment.fullPageRefreshInSeconds`, `interval` from rxjs, and the `myFullPageRefresh` method. Detail the lifecycle of this refresh process â€“ when does it start, and how frequently does it execute?
