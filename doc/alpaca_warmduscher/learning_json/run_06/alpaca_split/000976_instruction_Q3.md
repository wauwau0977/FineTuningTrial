For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' with name 'SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java' where below a part of it is displayed... 

```java
   Integer getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow();
```

Considering the method signature `Integer getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow()`, what potential implications does using the `Integer` wrapper class (rather than the primitive `int`) have, particularly in scenarios where no probes are present in the sample window?
