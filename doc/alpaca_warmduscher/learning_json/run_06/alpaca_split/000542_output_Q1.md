The `plotBands` array in the `gaugeChartOptions` is used to visually highlight different ranges of values on the gauge chart. Each object within the array defines a band, specifying a range of values (`from` and `to`) and a color to fill that range.

In this specific implementation, the `plotBands` create a color-coded scale on the gauge:

*   Values between 20 and 30 are colored green (`#55BF3B`).
*   Values between 30 and 50 are colored yellow (`#DDDF0D`).
*   Values between 50 and 65 are colored red (`#DF5353`).

This allows for a quick and intuitive understanding of the current value in relation to a defined scale.  For example, if the current speed is 40 km/h, the gauge will display a yellow band up to that value, visually indicating that the speed is within a moderate range. It enhances readability and provides immediate feedback on the data being displayed.
