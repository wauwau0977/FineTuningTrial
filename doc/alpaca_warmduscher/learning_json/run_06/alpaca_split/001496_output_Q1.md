`assertEquals` is a straightforward assertion method that directly compares the expected and actual values. In this context, it's beneficial because it clearly expresses the intended behavior â€“ verifying that `getSignedNumber` returns the correct signed integer for given inputs. However, the main drawback is that if the assertion fails, it only provides the expected and actual values without much context.

More appropriate methods could include:
*   `assertTrue(condition)` or `assertFalse(condition)`: If the logic could be expressed as a boolean condition, it might be more readable.
*   `assertThrows`: If the `getSignedNumber` method were to throw an exception for invalid inputs (which it doesn't appear to, based on this test), `assertThrows` would be ideal.
*   `assertAll`: For a more comprehensive test, `assertAll` could group multiple assertions, providing a more detailed failure report.

However, for simple value comparison, `assertEquals` is perfectly adequate and maintainable.
