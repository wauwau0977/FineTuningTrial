The `public` keyword before each parameter in the constructor defines those parameters as public properties of the class. Essentially, it's a concise way of declaring and initializing instance variables (or fields) of the class.

The benefit it provides is significant code simplification and readability.  Without `public`, you would need to declare each of these properties as private or protected and then assign the constructor parameters to them within the constructor body. Using `public` eliminates the need for these separate declaration and assignment steps.  It automatically creates the instance variables and initializes them with the values passed into the constructor. This makes the code more compact and easier to understand. It also provides direct access to these properties from outside the class, which can be convenient in certain scenarios, although it's important to consider encapsulation principles when deciding if public access is appropriate.
