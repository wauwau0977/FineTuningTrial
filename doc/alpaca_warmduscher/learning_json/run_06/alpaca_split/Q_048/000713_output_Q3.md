The `init()` method is intended to perform any necessary setup or initialization operations required by the `MeteoDataService` before it can start providing meteorological data.  It's a common pattern in interfaces to have an `init()` method to allow the implementing class to configure itself.

In this context, the `init()` method might perform the following operations:

*   **Establish a connection:**  Connect to the MeteoSwiss API or data source (e.g., database, file system).
*   **Load configuration:** Read configuration parameters from a file or environment variables, such as API keys, endpoints, or data caching settings.
*   **Initialize data structures:** Create or initialize any internal data structures used to store or process the data (e.g., caches, maps).
*   **Load initial data:** Possibly load an initial batch of data to populate a cache or ensure the service is ready to respond quickly.
*   **Validate Configuration:** Perform checks to ensure all necessary parameters are present and valid.

The `init()` method provides a well-defined point for the implementing class to set up everything it needs to function correctly, before being called to provide data with the `getData()` method. It allows for a clean separation of initialization and data retrieval.
