The `checkString` method generates random byte arrays and tests the `encode` and `decode` methods. Looking at the assertion `assertEquals( Arrays.toString(randomBytes), Arrays.toString(decodedBytes),"Bytes must match");`, what potential issues might arise from comparing `Arrays.toString()` outputs of byte arrays, and how could this be improved for a more robust comparison?
