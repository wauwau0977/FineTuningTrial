Angular Material provides significant benefits, but also introduces potential drawbacks concerning performance and maintainability.

**Benefits:**

* **Rapid Development:** Components like `<mat-card>` drastically speed up development by providing pre-built, styled, and accessible UI elements.  We don't need to write CSS from scratch for common UI patterns.
* **Consistency:** Ensures a consistent look and feel throughout the application, improving user experience.
* **Accessibility:** Angular Material components are generally designed with accessibility in mind, helping to create a more inclusive application.
* **Theming:**  Provides a robust theming system that allows for easy customization of the application's visual style.
* **Responsiveness:**  Components are often built with responsiveness in mind, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

**Drawbacks (and mitigation):**

* **Bundle Size:** Including the entire Angular Material library can significantly increase the application's bundle size, impacting initial load time. *Mitigation:* Use Angular's tree-shaking capabilities to remove unused components.  Import only the necessary modules.
* **Styling Overrides:** Overriding default Material styles can be challenging and may require using `!important` rules or complex CSS selectors.  This can lead to maintainability issues. *Mitigation:*  Utilize Material's theming system to customize styles in a more controlled manner. Use CSS variables.
* **Component Complexity:** Material components can be complex internally, potentially impacting performance if used incorrectly.  *Mitigation:*  Understand the component's API and limitations.  Avoid unnecessary nesting or complex configurations.
* **Dependency on Library:**  The application becomes dependent on Angular Material.  If the library is updated or deprecated, it may require significant effort to migrate to a new solution. *Mitigation:* Stay up-to-date with Angular Material releases and plan for potential migrations.
