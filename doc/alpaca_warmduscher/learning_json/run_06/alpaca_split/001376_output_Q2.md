The primary aspects to focus on when unit testing this `JSONFactory` class are:

1.  **Bean Creation:** Verify that the `jacksonFactory()` method correctly creates and registers a `JacksonFactory` bean with the Spring application context.
2.  **Customization (if any):** If customizations are added to the factory (e.g., setting specific serialization features), verify that these customizations are correctly applied to the returned `JacksonFactory` instance.
3. **Singleton Behavior:** Given that `getDefaultInstance()` is used, confirm that the same instance is returned across multiple calls.

Here are two specific test cases:

**Test Case 1: Bean Creation Verification**

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class JSONFactoryTest {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @Test
    public void testJacksonFactoryBeanCreation() {
        // Get the JacksonFactory bean from the application context
        JacksonFactory factory = applicationContext.getBean(JacksonFactory.class);

        // Assert that the bean is not null
        assertNotNull(factory);

        // Assert that the bean is indeed an instance of JacksonFactory
        assertTrue(factory instanceof JacksonFactory);
    }
}
```

This test case verifies that the `jacksonFactory()` method correctly registers a `JacksonFactory` bean with the Spring application context. It retrieves the bean using `applicationContext.getBean(JacksonFactory.class)` and asserts that the retrieved bean is not null and is an instance of `JacksonFactory`.

**Test Case 2: Customization Verification (Assuming customization added to JacksonFactory)**

Let's assume we added customization to set the `SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS` to `true`:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class JSONFactoryTest {

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    @Test
    public void testJacksonFactoryCustomization() {
        // Get the JacksonFactory bean from the application context
        JacksonFactory factory = applicationContext.getBean(JacksonFactory.class);
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = factory.createObjectMapper();

        // Assert that the ObjectMapper has the custom serialization feature enabled
        assertTrue(objectMapper.isEnabled(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS));
    }
}
```

This test case verifies that the customization applied to the `JacksonFactory` (in this case, enabling `SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS`) is correctly applied to the returned `JacksonFactory`'s `ObjectMapper`. It retrieves the `ObjectMapper` from the factory and asserts that the specified serialization feature is enabled.  These tests ensure the `JSONFactory` is correctly configured and integrated into the Spring context.
