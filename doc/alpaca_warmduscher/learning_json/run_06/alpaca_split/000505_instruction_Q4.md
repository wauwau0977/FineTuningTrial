For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/entities/meteoSwissEntity.ts' with name 'meteoSwissEntity.ts' we have the following question: 
Explain the purpose and implementation details of the `emptyInstance` static method in the `MeteoSwissEntity` class. What values are assigned to each of the properties in the returned `MeteoSwissEntity` instance, and what is the likely use case for this method?
