The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header specifies which request headers are allowed in cross-origin HTTP requests.  Including "X-Requested-With" is important because it's a non-standard header often used by older versions of jQuery (and potentially other JavaScript libraries/frameworks) to signal that a request was made using XMLHttpRequest.

Without explicitly including "X-Requested-With" in the allowed headers, the browser might block the request due to the "simple request" rules for CORS.  Simple requests only allow a limited set of headers (Content-Type, Origin, and Accept).  If a cross-origin request includes "X-Requested-With" (and isnâ€™t a simple request), the server *must* include it in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to allow the request.

The comment "// X-Requested-With avoid not allowed" indicates that the developer anticipates potential issues if this header is *not* included. Modern browsers and libraries are becoming less reliant on this header, but it's often included for backward compatibility. Omitting it could break functionality in older clients. Though generally considered legacy, its inclusion ensures broader compatibility.
