Several design patterns and principles could be applied to reduce code duplication and improve organization:

*   **Composition over Inheritance:** Instead of creating subclasses for different types of temperature readings, use composition.  Create a `TemperatureReading` class with `value`, `min`, and `max` properties, and then the `HeatingEntity` would have properties like `boilerTemperature: TemperatureReading`, `heatingInTemperature: TemperatureReading`, etc.
*   **Data Classes/Records (if supported by the language/framework):** These provide a concise way to define classes that primarily hold data. This would simplify the class definition.
*   **Fluent Builder Pattern:** If the object creation is complex, a Fluent Builder can make it more readable and maintainable. This isn't essential here, but could be useful if the initialization logic becomes more involved.
*   **Range/Interval Class:** Create a dedicated `Range` or `Interval` class with `min` and `max` properties.  The `HeatingEntity` could then have properties like `boilerTemperatureRange: Range`. This encapsulates the concept of a range, making it reusable.
*   **Principle of Least Astonishment:** While not a pattern, applying this principle would suggest that closely related properties should be grouped together in a logical way. In this case, all temperature-related properties should be logically grouped to enhance readability and maintainability.
