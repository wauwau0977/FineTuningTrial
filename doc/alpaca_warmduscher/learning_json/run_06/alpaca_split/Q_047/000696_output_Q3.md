The purpose of calling `meteoDataService.init()` within the constructor is to initialize the `meteoDataService` object. This likely sets up any necessary connections, loads configuration data, or performs other setup tasks required for the `meteoDataService` to function correctly.  The comment "// init" explicitly indicates this intention.

Potential issues if this initialization fails depend on what `meteoDataService.init()` actually *does*.  However, common issues could include:

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The `init()` method might attempt to connect to an external service or allocate resources, and failure could lead to errors.
*   **Invalid Configuration:** The `init()` method might load configuration files, and an invalid configuration could cause the application to fail.
*   **Dependency Issues:** The `init()` method might rely on other services or components, and if those are unavailable, initialization could fail.

Since the code doesn't include error handling *within* the constructor around the `init()` call, a failure in `init()` will likely cause a runtime exception that bubbles up and could crash the Spring application context during startup.  The code *does* have a try-catch block in the `pollData` method, but that won't prevent initialization errors; it handles errors during *data polling*, not setup.
