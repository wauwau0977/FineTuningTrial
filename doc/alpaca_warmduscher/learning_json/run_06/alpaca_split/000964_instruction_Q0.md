You are a developer of project 'Warmduscher'. It's your task to implement according to the specification below# IT Specification

## 1. Summary

This interface, `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats`, defines a data contract for representing statistical data related to the difference between sole in and out flow during a compressor operation. It's designed to hold aggregated data points – average, minimum, and maximum – for the sole in/out delta, along with compressor state and the number of probes used in the calculation.  This data is intended for analytics purposes, potentially for monitoring compressor performance or identifying anomalies.

## 2. File Information

- **File Location:** Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/db/entity/analytics/SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats.java
- **Class Name(s):** `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats`

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Primary Operations**: Defines the structure for accessing aggregated statistics related to sole in/out flow during compressor operation.
- **User Inputs & Outputs**: This interface *defines* the output data structure; it doesn’t handle inputs directly.  Implementations will *populate* this interface with data from other sources.
- **Workflow/Logic**:  The interface specifies that data will be aggregated (average, min, max) over a defined time window (start and end dates) and linked to a compressor state.
- **External Interactions**:  This interface is likely used by data access layers (e.g., a repository) to retrieve or persist statistical data, potentially interacting with a database or other data storage system.
- **Edge Cases Handling**:  Since it's an interface, edge case handling is the responsibility of the implementing classes.  Possible considerations include:
    - Handling of null or invalid dates.
    - Dealing with missing or incomplete data.
    - Appropriate default values if data is unavailable.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Accessing data through this interface should be efficient, as it’s likely part of a reporting or analytics pipeline. Optimized data access mechanisms in implementing classes are critical.
- **Scalability**: The data structure itself is scalable; the underlying storage (e.g., database) will dictate scalability.
- **Security**: Data access should be controlled to prevent unauthorized access to statistical data. Implementing classes should incorporate appropriate security measures.
- **Maintainability**: The interface is simple and well-defined, promoting maintainability. 
- **Reliability & Availability**:  The reliability and availability depend on the implementation and the data source.
- **Usability**: The interface provides a clear and intuitive structure for accessing statistical data.
- **Compliance**: Compliance depends on the nature of the data being tracked and any relevant data privacy regulations.

## 5. Key Components

- **Functions**:
    - `getMeasurementDateStart()`: Returns the starting date and time of the measurement window.
    - `getMeasurementDateEnd()`: Returns the ending date and time of the measurement window.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg()`: Returns the average sole in/out delta during the measurement window.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMin()`: Returns the minimum sole in/out delta during the measurement window.
    - `getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMax()`: Returns the maximum sole in/out delta during the measurement window.
    - `getCompressorState()`: Returns the state of the compressor (e.g., on/off) during the measurement window.
    - `getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow()`: Returns the number of data probes used to calculate the statistics.
- **Important logic flows**: There are no logic flows within the interface itself. Implementing classes will dictate the data aggregation and calculation logic.
- **Error handling**: Error handling is the responsibility of the implementing classes.
- **Classes**:  This is an interface, not a class.  There may be implementing classes, but their details are not specified here.
- **Modules**:  Part of the `com.x8ing.thsensor.thserver.db.entity.analytics` module.

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Core Language Features

- `java.util.Date`: Used for representing dates and times.

### 6.2 External Frameworks & Libraries
- None explicitly stated, but Jackson annotations suggest potential usage for serialization/deserialization

### 6.3 Internal Project Dependencies
- None explicitly stated, but likely interacts with other modules within the `thsensor` project for data acquisition and persistence.

## 7. Potential Improvements

- **Performance Enhanecments:** Consider using more efficient data types if appropriate for the data range and precision.
- **Code Readability**: The interface itself is highly readable.
- **Security Improvements**:  Implement security measures in the implementing classes to control access to the underlying data.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Ensure the underlying data storage and retrieval mechanisms are scalable to handle large volumes of data. Consider using caching mechanisms to improve performance.
