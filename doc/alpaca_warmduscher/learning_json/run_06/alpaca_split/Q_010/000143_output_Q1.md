The current implementation has several drawbacks. Full page reloads are disruptive to the user experience, causing loss of application state (e.g., form data, scroll position), and can be resource intensive as the entire application needs to be re-downloaded and re-rendered. It also increases server load.

Alternatives include:

*   **Partial Updates with API Calls:** Instead of reloading the entire page, fetch only the data that needs to be updated via an API call to the server.  This is significantly more efficient and provides a smoother UX.  Angular's `HttpClient` would be used for this.  This requires backend support to provide appropriate API endpoints.

*   **WebSockets/Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Establish a persistent connection between the client and server. The server can then push updates to the client in real-time without the client needing to poll.  This provides the most responsive experience but requires more complex setup on both client and server.

*   **Component-Specific Updates:**  If only specific components need to be refreshed, trigger updates within those components using Angular's change detection mechanisms.  This might involve re-fetching data within a component and updating its template.

*   **Optimistic Updates with Caching:**  If updates are predictable, you could implement optimistic updates where the UI is updated immediately based on the expected server response, and then reconciled with the actual server response when it arrives.  This requires careful handling of potential conflicts.

The trade-offs are: API calls require backend modifications and network requests, WebSockets/SSE have higher initial setup complexity, and component-specific updates require more granular control over the application state. The best approach depends on the frequency of updates, the amount of data being updated, and the desired user experience.
