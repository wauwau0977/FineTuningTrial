The nested `over` clauses are used to perform window functions, which allow you to calculate values across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. In this case, they're used to find the first and last `boiler_temp` values, the minimum and maximum `boiler_temp` values, within a specific window defined by `year1`, `doy` (day of year), and `hour_of_day`, and ordered by `minute_of_hour`.

Let's break down how it works:

*   **`partition by year1, doy, hour_of_day`**: This divides the data into partitions based on the combination of year, day of year, and hour of the day.  The window function will be applied separately to each partition. Essentially, it resets the calculation for each unique combination of these three values.
*   **`order by minute_of_hour`**: Within each partition, this sorts the rows by the minute of the hour. This determines the order in which the window function is applied.
*   **`first_value(boiler_temp) over (...)`**: This returns the value of `boiler_temp` from the *first* row within the current partition when sorted by `minute_of_hour`.
*   **`last_value(boiler_temp) over (...)`**: This returns the value of `boiler_temp` from the *last* row within the current partition when sorted by `minute_of_hour`.
*   **`min(boiler_temp) over (...)`**:  This returns the minimum `boiler_temp` value within the current partition.
*   **`max(boiler_temp) over (...)`**: This returns the maximum `boiler_temp` value within the current partition.

In essence, these clauses efficiently calculate key statistics (first, last, min, max) within hourly intervals for each day of the year, without needing to perform complex self-joins or subqueries. They allow the query to operate on subsets of the data based on time intervals, making the calculations accurate and performant.
