`zone.js` is a crucial component of Angular applications. It provides a mechanism for managing asynchronous operations and change detection. It works by creating "zones" that intercept and monitor asynchronous tasks (like timers, event listeners, and HTTP requests). When an asynchronous task completes within a zone, `zone.js` triggers Angular's change detection process, which updates the UI to reflect any changes.

Essentially, `zone.js` allows Angular to know *when* and *how* to update the DOM in response to asynchronous events. Without it, Angular would not be able to track changes effectively, and the UI would not update correctly or at all.

If the `import 'zone.js';` statement were removed or commented out, the application would likely fail to initialize properly or exhibit unpredictable behavior.  Angular's change detection system would be broken, leading to a static UI that does not respond to user interactions or data changes.  Errors related to change detection or dependency injection would likely occur.  The application would essentially become non-functional as Angular would not be able to manage its internal state and update the view. In short, Angular fundamentally relies on `zone.js` to function correctly.
