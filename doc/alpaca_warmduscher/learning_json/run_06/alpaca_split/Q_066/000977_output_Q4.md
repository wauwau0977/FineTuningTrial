The `SoleInOutDeltaInOperationStats` interface defines a contract for representing analytics data related to the difference between inflow and outflow (sole in/out delta) during an operation, likely within a thermal sensor system. It's designed to encapsulate statistical information collected over a specific time window.

The interface represents data concerning the delta of 'sole' (likely referring to a specific sensor reading or quantity) inflow and outflow during an operation. This data is gathered over a defined time window and provides statistical insights like average, minimum, and maximum deltas.  The `compressorState` indicates whether a compressor was active during measurement, impacting the readings, and `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow` describes the data sample size for the statistics.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each method:

*   `Date getMeasurementDateStart()`: Returns the starting date and time of the measurement window.  Used to identify the beginning of the data collection period.
*   `Date getMeasurementDateEnd()`: Returns the ending date and time of the measurement window.  Used to identify the end of the data collection period.
*   `Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg()`: Returns the average difference between inflow and outflow during the measurement window. Useful for understanding the typical delta value.
*   `Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMin()`: Returns the minimum difference between inflow and outflow during the measurement window. Indicates the lowest delta value observed.
*   `Double getSoleInOutDeltaInOperationMax()`: Returns the maximum difference between inflow and outflow during the measurement window. Indicates the highest delta value observed.
*   `Boolean getCompressorState()`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the compressor was active during the measurement window. Knowing the compressor state is crucial as it directly impacts inflow/outflow rates and sensor readings.
*   `Integer getTotalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow()`: Returns the number of data points ("probes") used to calculate the statistics. This indicates the sample size and influences the reliability of the statistical values.

The `@JsonPropertyOrder` annotation is used to control the order in which the properties of this interface are serialized into a JSON response.  In this case, it specifies that when an object implementing this interface is converted to JSON, the properties should appear in the specified order: `measurementDateStart`, `measurementDateEnd`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationAvg`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMin`, `soleInOutDeltaInOperationMax`, `compressorState`, `totalNumberOfProbesInSampleWindow`. This is beneficial for consistent API responses and potentially for improved readability or processing on the client side.
