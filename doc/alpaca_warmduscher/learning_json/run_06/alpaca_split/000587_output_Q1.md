While `toBeTruthy()` confirms the component instance was created, it doesn’t verify any functional behavior. To provide more comprehensive coverage, I would add tests focusing on:

1.  **Initial Values:** Test if properties of the component have the expected initial values. For example, if the component has a list of items, check if it’s initially empty or populated with default data.
2.  **Template Rendering:** Verify that the component’s template renders correctly. This can involve checking for the presence of specific HTML elements, text content, or data bindings. You could use `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement` to access the rendered DOM.
3.  **Data Binding:** If the component displays data from input properties or services, test if the data is correctly bound and displayed in the template.
4.  **Event Handling:** If the component has event handlers (e.g., button clicks, form submissions), test if those handlers are triggered correctly and perform the expected actions. This would involve simulating events and verifying the component’s response.
5.  **Component Interactions:**  If the component interacts with other components or services, mock those dependencies and verify that the interactions happen correctly.
6.  **Edge Cases:** Test how the component handles edge cases or unexpected input (e.g., invalid data, empty lists).

For example, if `OverviewCurrentComponent` displays a list of items:

*   I'd test that the list is initially empty.
*   I'd test that when data is provided to the component, the list correctly displays those items.
*   I'd test that if the data is empty, a "no data" message is displayed.
