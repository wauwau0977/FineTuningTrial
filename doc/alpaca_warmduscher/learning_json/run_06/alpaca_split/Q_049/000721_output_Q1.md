The current calculations are very basic and produce linearly increasing/decreasing values. To improve realism, several factors could be incorporated:

*   **Randomness:** Introduce random fluctuations to both wind speed and temperature. Instead of `dtS / 30 + 60`, use something like `(dtS / 30 + 60) + (new Random().nextDouble() * 10) - 5` to add some noise (a random value between -5 and 5).
*   **Seasonality:** Add a sinusoidal component to simulate seasonal variations in temperature.
*   **Time of Day:** Introduce a diurnal temperature variation, with higher temperatures during the day and lower temperatures at night.
*   **Wind Variation:** Model wind gusts as intermittent spikes rather than a constant increase.
*   **Correlation:**  Temperature and wind speed are often correlated.  Adjust the calculations to reflect this relationship (e.g., higher wind speeds might coincide with lower temperatures).
*   **Historical Data:** If available, use historical weather data for Kloten to inform the calculations and create more realistic patterns.
*   **Range Limiting:**  Ensure that generated values stay within reasonable physical limits (e.g., temperature doesn't drop below absolute zero).

For example, a more sophisticated temperature calculation could be: `(dtS / 10 - 10) + (Math.sin(dtS / 24) * 5) + (new Random().nextDouble() * 2) - 1`. This introduces a daily cycle and some random noise.
