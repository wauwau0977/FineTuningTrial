For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/overview-current/overview-current.component.spec.ts' with name 'overview-current.component.spec.ts'... 
The test suite only contains one test: `it('should create', () => { expect(component).toBeTruthy(); });`. What is the purpose of this test, and what are some other types of tests you would add to ensure the `OverviewCurrentComponent` is functioning correctly?
