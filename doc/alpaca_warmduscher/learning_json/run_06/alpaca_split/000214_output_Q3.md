`TestBed.inject(HeatingDataService)` is used to obtain an instance of the `HeatingDataService` from the Angular dependency injection system within the testing module created by `TestBed.configureTestingModule({})`.

The `service` variable is then assigned this instance.  Because we’ve configured a testing module, Angular’s dependency injection can resolve the `HeatingDataService` dependency. `TestBed.inject()` retrieves the resolved instance. This allows the test to interact with and test the methods and properties of the service.  Critically, because this is happening within a testing module, any dependencies of `HeatingDataService` can be mocked or stubbed before this line executes, allowing controlled testing scenarios. The `service` variable becomes the test subject.
