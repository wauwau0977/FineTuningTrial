The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are intrinsically linked and should always be overridden together. This is due to the contract defined by the `Object` class and how Java uses these methods, particularly in collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap`.

*   **`equals()`**: Determines if two objects are logically equal based on their attributes.

*   **`hashCode()`**: Returns an integer value representing the object.  Objects that are equal according to `equals()` *must* return the same `hashCode()`.

If only `equals()` were implemented correctly, the following problems would occur:

*   **Collections would not work as expected**: Collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap` rely on `hashCode()` to determine where to store objects. If two objects are equal (according to `equals()`) but have different hash codes, the collection would treat them as distinct, leading to unexpected behavior, data duplication, or incorrect lookups.

*   **Performance Degradation**: The collection would not be able to efficiently locate objects, resulting in significantly slower performance.

If only `hashCode()` were implemented correctly, while technically not violating the contract, it wouldn't be logically correct. Different objects could generate the same hash code and get stored in the same bucket in a hash-based collection, but the `equals()` method would incorrectly report them as different.

Therefore, the correct implementation ensures consistency between `equals()` and `hashCode()`, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of data structures that rely on these methods.
