For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/cache/cache.service.ts' with name 'cache.service.ts' we have the following question: 
Describe the functionality of the `get` method in the `CacheService`. Specifically, explain how it utilizes the `cache` object, the `loader` function, and the `shareReplay` operator to manage and serve cached data. Detail the behavior of the method when `evict` or `doNotCache` parameters are set to true.
