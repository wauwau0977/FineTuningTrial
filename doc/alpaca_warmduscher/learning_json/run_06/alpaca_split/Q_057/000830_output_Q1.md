The `@SuppressWarnings("SqlResolve")` annotation suppresses a warning related to SQL resolution. This warning usually appears when Spring Data JPA attempts to analyze the method names to generate queries but is unable to fully resolve the SQL for those queries at compile time.  In this case, it's likely that the framework cannot determine all details of the SQL query solely from the method signature, possibly due to the complexity of the underlying database schema or the query derivation process. Suppressing the warning is a pragmatic approach when the code is known to be correct, and the warning is just a result of limitations in the analysis tools.  It’s important to understand that suppressing warnings should be done cautiously and only when you’re confident that the underlying issue isn't a real error.
