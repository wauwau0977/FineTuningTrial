This test method, `convert1`, aims to verify the round-trip conversion functionality of the `UUIDUtils` class. Specifically, it checks if a UUID can be successfully converted to a shorter text representation using `UUIDUtils.toShortText()`, and then converted back to a UUID using `UUIDUtils.fromShortText()` *without any loss of information*.

The test generates a random UUID (`uuidIn`), converts it to a short text string (`shortUUID`), and then reconstructs a UUID (`uuidOut`) from that string. It then asserts that `uuidIn` and `uuidOut` are equal, and that their string representations are also equal. This ensures that the conversion process is lossless and that the original UUID can be perfectly reconstructed from its short text equivalent.  The `System.out.println` statements serve to provide visibility into the values being tested.
