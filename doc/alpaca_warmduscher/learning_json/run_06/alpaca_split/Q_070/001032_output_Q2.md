The logging statement `log.info("Did poll data and persisted it successfully. dt=" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - t0));` can introduce a slight performance impact, particularly under high load, due to a few factors:

*   **String Concatenation:** String concatenation (using `+`) creates new String objects, which can be relatively expensive.
*   **I/O Operation:** Logging is an I/O operation. Writing to the log file, even if asynchronous, takes time and resources.
*   **Synchronization:** Logging frameworks often employ synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety, which can add overhead.

While the overhead is likely minimal for a single execution, it can accumulate under high load, potentially contributing to increased response times or resource contention.

A more robust approach to monitoring performance without introducing significant overhead would be to utilize a **Metrics library** like Micrometer or Prometheus. These libraries provide mechanisms for:

1.  **Counters/Gauges:** Instead of logging the execution time as a string, track the execution time as a numerical metric (e.g., a histogram or a summary).  This allows for more accurate analysis and aggregation.

2.  **Asynchronous Metric Export:** Metrics libraries typically export metrics asynchronously, minimizing the impact on the application's main thread.

3.  **Aggregation & Analysis:**  Metrics can be aggregated and analyzed using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or other monitoring dashboards.  This allows you to track trends, identify performance bottlenecks, and set alerts.

4. **Sampling:** Use sampling techniques to collect only a subset of execution times.  This reduces the overhead without significantly affecting the accuracy of the metrics.

For example, using Micrometer, you could replace the logging statement with:

```java
Timer timer = Timer.builder("heating.data.poll")
                .unit(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .register(micrometerRegistry); // Assuming you have a Micrometer registry configured

try (Timer.TimerContext context = timer.start()) {
    // Your pollData() logic here
}
```
This approach provides more granular and accurate performance data without the overhead of string concatenation and I/O operations. It also allows you to integrate with existing monitoring systems and dashboards.
