Several aspects of the `chartOptionsWindGustMeteo` configuration suggest that the wind gust data is likely to be noisy or volatile:

1. **Line Chart Type:** While suitable for showing trends, a line chart readily displays even small fluctuations in data. For very stable data, a column chart might be more appropriate.
2.  **No smoothing or aggregation:** There's no apparent data smoothing or aggregation applied within the configuration. The chart appears to directly plot the raw wind gust measurements.
3. **`lineWidth: 3`**: A relatively thick line width could be used to emphasize the line and make it easier to see despite potential fluctuations.
4. **Absence of range-based visualization:** The configuration utilizes a line chart, which is suitable for representing continuous data like wind gusts. However, it doesn't incorporate range-based visualization (like area ranges), suggesting that the focus is on pinpointing specific gust values, potentially in a volatile environment.
