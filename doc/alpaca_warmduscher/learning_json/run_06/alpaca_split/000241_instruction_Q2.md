For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thclient/src/main/www/thserver-client/src/app/my-http-interceptor.service.ts' with name 'my-http-interceptor.service.ts'... 
The code uses `environment.buildTimestampClient` to set the client version. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using this approach for versioning compared to, for example, reading the version from a `package.json` file?
