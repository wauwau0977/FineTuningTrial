There are several approaches to adding a method to find entries based on a date range:

1.  **Derived Query Method:**  This is the simplest approach if the method name adheres to Spring Data JPA's naming conventions. For example, a method named `findByTemperatureMeasureDateBetween` would be automatically implemented by Spring Data JPA, assuming your entity has a `temperatureMeasureDate` field.

    *   **Trade-offs:**  Easy to implement, but requires adhering to the naming convention. Might not be suitable for complex queries.

2.  **`@Query` Annotation with JPQL:**  You could define a custom query method using the `@Query` annotation and JPQL. This provides more flexibility than derived query methods.

    ```java
    @Query("SELECT e FROM MeteoSwissEntity e WHERE e.temperatureMeasureDate BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate")
    List<MeteoSwissEntity> findByDateRange(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate);
    ```

    *   **Trade-offs:**  More flexible than derived query methods, but requires writing JPQL. Still database-agnostic.

3.  **`@Query` Annotation with Native SQL:** Similar to the JPQL approach, but using native SQL.

    ```java
    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM meteo_swiss WHERE temperature_measure_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate", nativeQuery = true)
    List<MeteoSwissEntity> findByDateRangeNative(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate);
    ```

    *   **Trade-offs:**  Most flexible, but database-specific and loses the benefits of JPQL.

4.  **Custom Repository Implementation:** You could create a custom repository interface and provide a custom implementation with the desired logic.

    *   **Trade-offs:**  Most control, but requires more code and maintenance.

**Which approach would I choose and why?**

I would generally prefer the **`@Query` annotation with JPQL** approach. It strikes a good balance between flexibility, maintainability, and database portability. It allows me to define the query logic explicitly while remaining database-agnostic. It's also relatively easy to implement and test.  If the query becomes very complex, I might consider a custom repository implementation, but I would try to avoid it if possible. The derived query method is useful if the naming convention fits the requirement.
