Injecting the `ClientIdService` is a deliberate design choice that promotes several key principles:

*   **Dependency Inversion:** The interceptor *depends* on an abstraction (`ClientIdService`) rather than a concrete implementation. This makes the interceptor more flexible and easier to change. If the way client IDs are obtained changes, only the `ClientIdService` needs to be modified; the interceptor remains untouched.
*   **Testability:** Injecting the dependency allows us to easily mock or stub the `ClientIdService` in unit tests. We can provide a test double that returns a predictable client ID, isolating the interceptor's behavior and ensuring that tests are reliable and focused.
*   **Maintainability:**  Centralizing the logic for retrieving the client ID within the `ClientIdService` improves code organization and reduces duplication.  Any changes to the client ID retrieval process only need to be made in one place.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The interceptor is responsible for modifying the request headers, while the `ClientIdService` is responsible for retrieving the client ID. This clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

If the client ID were accessed directly within the intercept method, it would create a tight coupling between the interceptor and the specific implementation of the client ID retrieval logic, making testing and maintenance more difficult.
