For Project 'Warmduscher' considering file in path 'Warmduscher/thserver/src/main/java/com/x8ing/thsensor/thserver/utils/Physics.java' with name 'Physics.java' we have the following question: 
Implement a static method named `calculateAbsoluteHumidityApproximation` within the `Physics` class. This method should accept two double arguments: `temperature` (in Celsius) and `relativeHumidity` (as a percentage represented as a decimal – e.g., 60% would be 0.6). The method should calculate and return the approximate absolute humidity in grams per cubic meter (g/m³), using the formula provided in the Javadoc comment. Ensure the calculation adheres precisely to the provided formula, utilizing `Math.exp` for the exponential calculation. The method should be `public` and `static`.
