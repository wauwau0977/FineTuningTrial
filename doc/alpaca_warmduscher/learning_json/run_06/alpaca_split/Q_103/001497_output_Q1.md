I would expand the test suite to cover the following:

*   **Boundary Value Analysis:**  Explicit tests for the minimum and maximum values (0 and 65535) to confirm handling at the edges of the valid range. These are already present, but I'd make them explicit test cases with descriptive names.
*   **Values around the transition point:** Add test cases specifically around the value 32767 and 32768. This is where the positive to negative conversion happens, and it’s critical to ensure accuracy.
*   **Invalid Input Handling:** While the current tests only cover valid inputs, I’d add tests to verify the behavior when provided with negative numbers (less than 0) or values greater than 65535.  The method should either handle these gracefully (e.g., by throwing an exception) or have documented behavior.
*   **Performance Tests:** For a more robust suite, I'd add basic performance tests to ensure the method isn't excessively slow.
*   **Randomized Tests:** Generate a set of random numbers within the valid range and verify the correctness of the conversion. This helps uncover hidden bugs.
*   **Test for data types:** If the method allows other data types as input, for example, a short integer, it should also be tested.

These additions would help create a more comprehensive and robust test suite, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the `getSignedNumber` method.
